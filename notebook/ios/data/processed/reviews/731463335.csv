- 9/10 times the app will simply not connect to the AI light and throws of various errors.

- Frustrating setup process that is both poorly designed and doesn't work unless you restart your hardware multiple times.

- Lack of any user guide or instruction on how various programs work with your light - no user guide in the box or on the website either.

- App loses saved settings and overrides previous settings sporadically.

Simply a poorly built app that fails miserably at basic items such as connecting to the light fixture to begin with making the experience unusable, frustrating and worthy of a product return. Not ready for prime time and needs to be fixed asap.

Conceptually a great idea, but poorly executed.";"2017-11-23T04:01:43-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=731463335&type=Purple%20Software";"731463335";148;"en";"NEGATIVE"

- It would be helpful if the current button (Enable Schedule, Feed Mode, Pumps On, or Pumps Off) you have pressed us highlighted. Sometimes I’ve chosen Feed Mode or Enable Schedule and I’m not sure if the command was taken because the button does show chosen you have to observe the powerheads to see if there was a change. 
- Feed Mode - it would be nice if there was a countdown for the time you’ve chosen. Showing how much time until the powerheads go back on. Then I can program my pump to come on at the exact same time. I have my feed mode set to 15 minutes but it would be nice to know how much time I have left after I finish feeding them. 
- When on Feed Mode, if you look at the individual powerheads under flow, it shows the programmed flow percentage instead of the percentage the powerheads are currently in under feed mode. That should update to show the current percentage the powerheads are at, at that moment and then readjust once the feed mode switches back to the enabled schedule.

- Boosted the red and blue channels a bit for theoretical (mine) improved growth spectrum for macro algae (no rock) and lowered the green channel a bit. 
- Set timer with a 10 hour light cycle with 2-hour ramp up & ramp down.
- When I’m not traveling, I occasionally set a 4-hour low output blue-spectrum ‘moon light’ to help see the bugs (amphis, copes, bristles and hair worms).

The green macros (Ulva and chaeto) have had great growth and color. The red macro (gracilaria) is keeping its rich maroon color and is showing significant growth.

For my usage, the app is a wonderful addition to an elegant small footprint led light. It allows me to customize output intensity and spectrum (as well as timer, ramps, etc). 

I never use the weather or moonlight settings. I only use the light’s local hotspot and don’t have it connected online, so I can’t comment on accessing the light remotely. I just set and forget.

The problem is from the first month I've owned the light I've had multiple programing issues. Funny as it seems (it's really more like panic) every time I go away, my light goes off line. It takes multiple calls to the company. I'm a master at all the different resets, and I've had to send the light in 3 times. Still have no answer why this happens very randomly. 
Once AI figures out the technical wifi issues, so there is no panic induced downtime, anyone who is thinking about purchasing any of their lights MUST have a backup just in case this happens to them. 
I will say AI is very good at getting back to their customers. They also have sent me ""replacement parts"" that were supposed to fix my issues. We shall see as the last down time was very recent. What I'm really hoping for is the real FIX with their wireless controller which is what I think the problem is.";"2016-05-19T02:00:59-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=731463335&type=Purple%20Software";"731463335";187;"en";"POSITIVE"
64;6976124137;"Lord Krath";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id37720084";3.1;3;"Works.";"Pros:
* Single app for managing AI devices.
* Not too much chrome means you see more stuff and not fluff.
* Basic functions work as expected.

Cons:
* Unusable cloud account creation.
* Weird organization of devices.

The app works to control my Prime32HDs and Nero3s, but the organization of devices into “tanks” is weird. You have to configure a  “tank” for each device *type*. Intuitively, we should be able to group lights, power heads, etc. logically under a single “tank.”

My biggest gripe?  Probably the organization.  
But then also there is the “waiting for authorization” message I get when I try to create a cloud account. What does that even mean?  It’s been months since I got my first device.

The products themselves work great and I quite like them. This app makes them usable, but it does feel also like a missed opportunity.

Feature requests that would be fantastic:
* Fix cloud account creation
* Enable smart home capabilities for use with SmartThings, Alexa, or even adjacent smart systems like Neptune’s Apex Fusion
* Enable “slide-locked” touch motions to adjust intensity for all channels for all times at once. I can do it with a single time setting, but not for the whole scheme. It is a challenge on a mobile phone and have to use iPad for these types of edits otherwise.
* If cloud account creation doesn’t allow for saving of profiles in the cloud (or if it will never allow registration), then perhaps at least enabling cloud profile saving (OneDrive, Google Drive, etc).
* Finally, an add-on module that would allow for WiFi control with the Prime32HDs and Nero3s which might enable the request smart home capabilities mentioned previously.";"2021-02-09T21:33:46-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=731463335&type=Purple%20Software";"731463335";285;"en";"POSITIVE"

It's a mixture between lightning and cloud cover which even though you're able to set likability for those settings it's very silly to have a small lighting storm EVERY day. If you could separate those two factors that would be great...I like the cloud cover because it gives my corals a resting period.
People are sharing settings out there that have this built into their day schedule where the lights go up and down, I want this setting without having to change my current light settings. Thanks guys! My favorite lights(:
