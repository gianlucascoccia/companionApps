Picture /video quality is good. After a few years I had the plastic bracket just fall off and SkyBell sent me a replacement. One of the cameras motion sensor plastic cover has fallen off but still works. Silicone works good around the sides to seal up bc I have spiders living in one of mine setting the motion off lol. It would be nice if night mode had a option to disable the lights so to see the actual night video instead of reflections from the led lights which drown out the pictures beyond 3-5 feet. The app stopped getting updates over a year ago and it sometimes crashes and locks up. Also I’ve noticed random disconnects from the cams to the iPhone app even though I have WiFi extenders everywhere and WiFi signal is strong. Does the cameras receive firmware updates causing reboots randomly? Any chance there will be updates to the App and firmware soon? I can’t really complain though as skybell is one of the few cams that doesn’t require a subscription which I really like and appreciate. The cams I will give a 4/5. And the app 3/5.

When I first installed this 3.5 months ago it worked great! I mean it never missed picking up motion and anytime anybody got anywhere close to the doorbell bam! Camera on! Now it’s just an expensive normal doorbell. SOB. It won’t pick up motion anymore. Don’t know what happened. All it does is activate the camera when the button is pressed but I can walk in and out of my front door ten times and it will never detect me or my roommate. About a month ago I called SkyBell customer service not once but twice. I was told that others were having a similar issue and that I need to let them upgrade me from version 5017 to 5025. I was told that would take 3 days. I waited a week. Nothing. I called back. I was told that yes I would have to keep waiting because it was taking them longer than normal and that they were having to do the upgrades one by one. They said this time that would be closer to two weeks. Well now I’ve waited a whole month and the only thing that has happened as the skybell motion sensing has gotten even worse. I mean it’s just pathetic.  For something that originally worked great out of the box and had no flaws and did everything exceptionally well, it’s baffling how a reputable company can take something so positive and screw it all up. Really starting to regret skybell all together now.

After a few months, the doorbell stopped detecting motion. So people are able to walk right up to my front door and the doorbell detects absolutely nothing unless it’s pressed. Then and only then will I get a notification stating that someone rang the bell. As far as getting notifications that there was motion detected, that is no more. I’ve done absolutely everything that could be done to troubleshoot this issue and nothing seems to work. Oh, and as far as customer service goes, good luck. No matter what time of day that you call or how many times that you call, NO ONE EVER PICKS UP THE PHONE. You get to listen to an automated recording that states that they are experiencing a higher than usual call volume and to please be advised that your call will be transferred to a voicemail after 15 minutes (WHICH IS GUARANTEED TO HAPPEN). When someone called me back a day or two later, I was advised that my software might be out of date and that the only way to update it would be on their end. I was told to give it a couple of days and that I would get a phone call back. That never happened. I can almost guarantee that my software is not the issue and that they can’t figure out what the problem is.

Some homeless guy came up and used our patio outlet to charge his phone at 2am and we had no idea. The outlet is practically below the doorbell.

Now we have no audio and we cannot review videos of recorded activity. The audio went out when our device was updated to the new iOS 12 a couple weeks ago. Skybell’s reply when I reported this was to uninstall iOS 12 if audio is important. Easier said then done.

Since I’m not in a neighborhood, this thing goes off often, so I’ve had to turn off the notifications for motion. The camera and doorbell work well. No complaints there, however, the app needs a lot of improvements.

App cons:
If you view a video in the “activity” feed, once you’re done viewing the video, the app automatically takes you all the way to the top of the videos instead of keeping you in the place you’re searching (so if you’re searching for videos that are towards the bottom, you get sent to the top and have to scroll all the way down through all the other videos when searching for a specific event). So it would be more efficient to watch a video and pick up where you left off on the list (especially when we have 50 different video events).

When you download a video to your cloud it doesn’t time stamp the video.

When the doorbell is activated, if I try to view/talk to the person at the door, the app takes a solid minute or two to connect. So usually someone leaves before I can address them.

You can’t access your SkyBell account, videos, activity, etc. online. It’s cell phone app only (unlike Nest, Reolink, etc).";"2020-02-03T17:32:47-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1035457926&type=Purple%20Software";"1035457926";225;"en";"POSITIVE"

Would love to see them expand into similar offerings like garage cameras, porch- and carriage-light cameras, homekit compatibility, a roku channel or something so I can see who’s at the door on my tv, etc.

However, it is pretty cheesy that they lied about having a temperature sensor, and though they did honor their warranty on my first one which was defective, they told me that its replacement had no warranty at all, so I guess it’s just luck that the replacement is doing ok so far, otherwise it would’ve been a complete ripoff.";"2019-12-05T08:53:29-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1035457926&type=Purple%20Software";"1035457926";147;"en";"POSITIVE"

BTW, unlike other reviews, I’ll tell you to stay clear away from Ribg, since you must PAY to get your own video recordings, but also the device leaks your WiFi credentials to anyone who can plug into the device.

I am an IT tech and by far I am more knowledgeable and ready to pick up the needed info to accomplish the task of connecting it and configure it, but the hurdles don’t stop here, and for other, they don’t even get to the point of configuring the device.
So now, the device blinks different color codes, and you will match each type of blinking to a map/legend. Let’s say for a minute - no biggie - but now the device does not do what it is supposed to do - e.g. syncing, broadcasting video and sound, in 20 attempts it works maybe once, if you’re lucky.

NOT SPIDER PROOF, little ones get inside and it stops working til you clean them out. NO NO NO SUPPORT. New problems=no help. No way to contact, the link in the app USED to bring you thru a million steps where eventually you could get help... now it only brings you to a partner sign up page FOR BUSINESSES. If you dig around long enough you can find videos of how to reset the bell, etc. If you are away you can’t reset it if it malfunctions so all features are the useless when you need them the most. You used to be able to have them do a remote reset but you can’t contact them at all anymore to ask them to! Worst ever! Also the camera misses so many things! It records for only so many seconds at a time so you see a car pull up, for instance, but miss who got out of it and where they went. There is no option to record continuously to search thru to watch more. I see a package dropped off, then I see it’s gone but not who stole it!! The only thing it’s slightly good for is seeing who’s at your door when they ring the bell. And you can speak to them thru it IF it connects before they give up and walk away. There are multiple other issues with this device, but I’d go on all day if I listed them all. I finally was able to get support but the support was ridiculous and didn’t work. They told me to sign out and delete the app and sign back in and manually delete every video. I live in a busy area there are countless videos in the more I believe the more come back from previous days. It takes me forever. Eventually it did fix the problem but then it started right that happening again. I have done this multiple times I don’t have time to delete and over and over again. The videos and days keep appearing all out of sequence. Also when I use the filter to see who rang the doorbell it shows no videos even though my doorbell really ran multiple times. Also Also doesn’t all The filter also doesn’t work. If I watch and create an on-demand video, it appears nowhere.

The connectivity is still hit or miss.  I've tried these doorbells on a lot of different network configurations at different houses and even in the ""best case scenario,"" the performance will be inconsistent at times.

The motion detection will only work in some instances and not others depending on the layout of your porch, the ambient temperature, and the direction people take will approaching your door.  Don't count on it.

Live chatting with a visitor is unlikely unless the person stands there for quite some time and you react to the notification instantly.  

The app doesn't tell you the temperature outside, so this is just plain false advertising.  This is not a critical feature, but they still shouldn't advertise something that it doesn't actually do.

I’ve had it over a month and it usually works. It alerts us to motion at the front door, even when an insect crawls over the camera lens. Unfortunately it does not always bring up the live view very quickly, which can be a pain when a delivery person is at the front door. It also periodically hangs, necessitating a reboot of my iPhone 8. Also the icons for talking or canceling during live view sometimes disappear making it necessary to reboot the iPhone. Some of the slow behavior switching into live view may be due to an undersized, under powered server for handling all the video.

I ended up getting the slim line model because they were out of the round ones.

You need to make sure your router is set up correctly and that it or an extender is close enough to the door bell to connect to it.

In short, the hardware seems serviceable, the app needs work and their server needs a boost in capacity. It would be nice if one could use ones own NAS and store the video’s locally. This would require them either writing the necessary software or publishing the hardware specs and the API for it so some one else could do that.

   The performance has dropped to the point where it is almost unusable. The UPS man came this morning and while the alert sound came to my phone, the device did not record the UPS man, but it did record me opening the door to pick the package up. The watch live function now takes minutes to load. Not useful for remote answering of the door.

Doorbell is on a covered porch so people are always ""backlit"" by a brighter scene behind them.  Once a person is finally in range to trigger motion, they're simply a black shadow. (2) Motion detection is iffy at all sensitivities and typically triggers as someone is pushing the doorbell, has been standing right next to the door for 5-10 seconds, or is actually opening the door. Worse during the day and at night after outside lights have been tuned off. At moderate lighting levels (cloudy, dusk, dawn, other porch lights on), it actually produces a really good picture. (3) Too many LED lights. When the motion detection triggers the light reflects off the wall behind and to the side and washes out some of the picture at night. With no WDR/HDR, the camera adjusts to the brightest part of the scene and it's difficult to see.

App: (1) A little slow to notify for motion and button pushes. (2) App starts too slow. Combined with the slow notification, on button pushes, the person is typically pushing the doorbell for a second or third time as I'm trying to answer them.

Overall, it's ok with the capability to be really good. When the lighting is right, it's spot on with what I was looking for.";"2017-09-07T06:16:18-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1035457926&type=Purple%20Software";"1035457926";225;"en";"POSITIVE"

Not sure how long this should take but it's a real pain not being able to use my new iPhone to adjust settings. 

That being said the device works decent and I will up grade m review to a 3 when I can use my iPhone. The reason for a 3 is that setting sync settings can be a pain, it freezes on getting new feeds and when someone rings the doorbell it freezes as well. So if you want a device that can periodically see out the front door this is the device for you. They have great potential and when they reduce the freezing and serious lag when then I will again upgrade my rating.

The most difficult part of the setup was syncing the device with the app and account. It required me to move my router very close to the doorbell in order to provide a good enough connection to synchronize the device. The app does have a lot of room for improvement and I hope that in time we will see that. It would be nice to see features like motion sensor sensitivity, choosing if the led changes colors when viewing the camera, and maybe allowing us to have a separate notification sound for motion than from the press of the doorbell.  Overall I am excited with this new product and look forward to seeing how they can improve on it.";"2015-10-27T15:34:52-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1035457926&type=Purple%20Software";"1035457926";158;"en";"POSITIVE"

It works great until I get notification that the doorbell has rung or that motion has been detected.  If I try to watch live to communicate with the person(a major purpose of the product), I loose the video recording of the encounter. What typically happens is that I get a notification on the app(using an iPhone 6 with iOS 10) I immediately try to connect (this take 5-10 seconds) and by then the person is gone.  Not generally a big deal but since I tried to connect the recording of that person is now gone also and I have no idea who it was.  The current solution is to not interact with anyone at the door and just wait to watch the video later. Kinda defeats the purpose of this device. I have contacted tech support and they say there is a problem and they are aware and are working on it.

The company just released a firmware update for the SkyBell HD that reduces the video recording delays when you activate the motion detection feature. Now the product detects and records people walking up to your door. 

Prior to the update, motion detection worked great but the video recordings were delayed so you would only see a person walking away. At best it was an expensive motion detector that allowed push notifications. I almost returned the product last month but held out with the hope the company would fix the functionality. That changed today. 

Five Stars for high quality video and sound plus free web hosted video recording. Push notifications let you know someone is walking up to your door. Great for seeing if a package was delivered. Plus two way communication through the video call feature. 

Four stars for some quirks in the app. Some of the setting changes require a system reboot to take effect. Also, there is no way to multi select videos for deletion.  

If you are planning on buying the SkyBell HD, the highest recording quality requires a strong wifi connection to the doorbell plus a fast internet connection.";"2017-01-12T18:58:56-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1035457926&type=Purple%20Software";"1035457926";198;"en";"POSITIVE"

Jeremy from SkyBell reached out to me shortly after I posted my review. (below) He resolved my issue in just a few minutes. Now that's customer service! To be fair, I left out in my review that SkyBell is a fantastic product. My issues were not with the camera, but more software related. All is working again and I am going to continue to recommend this product. 

Original review - But after the latest update I get 3 notifications in a row for everything. Please fix this!  Also, the sensor is either too high and detects everything or too low and detects nothing. Used to work fine. It detects a school bus driving down the road, but won't recognize people leaving or coming to the door.";"2017-05-23T21:09:33-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1035457926&type=Purple%20Software";"1035457926";131;"en";"POSITIVE"

Sometimes I can view live, but other times it's just a black screen.  It also seems to report false motion/notifications... or just delayed/repeated notifications from previous activity.  

When it does work, the interaction is relatively slow.  Especially when you're far away from the camera itself (like being at work).  When I receive notification that motion has been detected, the person is typically gone by the time I'm able to connect and view the live feed.

I like the idea of having a doorbell camera, but this one and the app could use some more polishing to make it more usable.

Even with this new update (which now allows users to select different trigger sensitivity), the false alarms are only cut in half at the lowest setting.

First - deleting videos (motion activation will create a lot) takes a long time. Ability to select multiple videos for deletion at once would be helpful. 

Second - all the video thumbnails constantly refresh which slows down the deletion process. Caching these would save both time and cellular data usage. A user isn't going to have thousands of these so not that much memory. 

Finally motion activation doesn't record until a person is gone which is only a few seconds from when they arrive (dropping off package, etc).

===================

Overall It works pretty well after first day of use.

The biggest problem so far is the ""motion detection recording feature"". It doesn't record it right away after someone trigger the sensor. It starts recording maybe 10 or more seconds after someone trigger it and that person already left. Thus you will got nothing there which lose the true function of motion detection recording feature.
