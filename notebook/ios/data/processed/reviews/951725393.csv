We installed this camera to monitor and detect when someone came into the alcove.  We get an alert and use the app to sound the alarm.  Be aware there is a 20-30 second delay from the time to activate the alarm until it actually sounds.  We suspect this is more of a cellular issue than product issue.  The other issue is the period we need the alarm to sound (off business hours) cannot be scheduled.  Alerts can be scheduled, but the auto alarm cannot be scheduled.  If it could, the lag issue would be eliminated.  Hopefully a software update can be provided soon so the alarm can be scheduled to automatically sound during scheduled off hours.";"2020-10-02T07:31:35-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951725393&type=Purple%20Software";"951725393";129;"en";"NEGATIVE"

Then one day, out of the blue, my Netatmo Outdoor camera just suddenly stopped working. I tried resetting it and it was obviously turning off & on because I could see the flood light. But even after troubleshooting it about a dozen times or more, Netatmo basically said it was defective and I’d have to buy a new one. I thought about it for awhile but decided against it because the software started becoming terrible!
I get notifications CONSTANTLY now and is unbelievably annoying. The settings for the notifications used to work perfectly but now, no matter what I do, it notifies me of every single movement. I’ll sometimes have a hundred or so notifications a day now. It is so bad that I just want to destroy it.
Save yourself some time, headache, and money and get yourself pretty much anything other than Netatmo. It may work well for a bit but then their hardware and software will become terrible. I have tried out many other options and they are much better. Get a Wyze Cam if you want something cheap or Nest Cam if you want the best.";"2019-11-28T09:40:02-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951725393&type=Purple%20Software";"951725393";222;"en";"POSITIVE"

And finding one that was comparable with HomeKit was a MUST. I know the price tag is a bit more then a Ring or whatever else seems to be the mainstream gadget, but in this case you get what you pay for. I LOVE my Netatmo Prescence. So much more then I ever thought I would. 

Beautiful picture, fast live stream with no lag whatsoever. It also differentiates people, animals, cars, and standard “motion” and the notifications tell you which it detects. Not many other smart cams do this and the ones that do DO NOT do it well. Night vision is perfect. I actually prefer it to the light at night. It’s SO clear. 

Speaking of he light...it’s fantastic. So bright I keep it dimmed to a lower setting usually. Will turn on when motion is detected if preferred. 

I have SO many more things I love about this product but I’m going to wrap it up, before ppl start to think I’m a paid Netatmo employee or something lol, (joking of course, I really do love this product THAT much) and I’ll leave you with this last one, and it’s a HUGE one...this camera stores it’s data on a SD card, and it encrypts it! NO SUBSCRIPTION NECESSARY! I can’t tell you how rare that is. And of course, if you prefer, you can store the data (encrypted of course) onto Dropbox or another preferred cloud storage OR an FTP server. 

Never owned a Netatmo product before this. Took a leap and got it...best choice I ever made for a smart home device. 

Much love.";"2021-08-20T22:06:17-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951725393&type=Purple%20Software";"951725393";275;"en";"POSITIVE"

The thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is that I cannot automate monitoring start/stop using a geo-fence.

Could use a better interface for configuring the network settings without having to flip the camera upside down and lose its position.

The bigger issue is that any time the Welcome camera is power cycled, it will sometimes just stop streaming video. Subsequent power cycles may or may not bring it back. If you need reliability, look elsewhere.

Edit: Response to developer response. I already contacted support 6 days ago and have only received an automated acknowledgement. There appears to be no phone number or other means of contacting Netatmo support.

I like the Cameras";"Netatmo, can you make it so the Presence Cameras can be turned onto their sides. So the rotate feature would have 45deg rotation options? I would like them to be up under the eves of my roof more and having them upside down looks funky. Plus they don’t tilt down as much when mounted upside down. 
Also would like to see an option to link cameras to start recording when another camera has already sensed motion so they don’t have to wait for motion to activate the record mode. I have 4 Presence cameras in my front yard and would like to link them when one gets triggered with motion.

In Apple HomeKit the Flood Light appears as a light to toggle on and off. It’s also dimmable. And you get a motion sensor functionality. So I setup a bunch of automations in HomeKit to turn on multiple lights when motion is sensed at night. Lighting up outside and some inside lights depending on time of day. 

Pros. No monthly fee. Local storage and to your own NAS or Dropbox. Apple HomeKit. 

Cons. When mounted upside down. You can’t tilt down very far if mounted on the wall. I ended up hanging it upside down from my eves. The camera doesn’t have a very wide field of view like some other cameras currently on the market that are HomeKit compatible.";"2019-03-04T12:00:22-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951725393&type=Purple%20Software";"951725393";230;"en";"POSITIVE"

Security: I dont know what the software team was thinking but the interface is now so sensitive that if a branch of a tree moves, I will get an alert that says motion detected. I am now getting on average 50 motion detected alerts per day on my phone. Needless to say, forget about storing videos on Dropbox because it fills up in a flash. What happens to the face detection/recognition system? It was useful and the main reason why I bought Security

Weather: It has been working wonders for years. I bought a rain gauge and tried to hook it up to the weather station. Not only, did it not connect the rain gauge, I also lost all weather measurements and I was never able to connect it again to the network. Help on the app/youtube was useless

Scale: worked again for years without a hitch. All of a sudden, the data wouldn’t transfer onto my phone. It still is the case today. I am too lazy to enter the measurements manually so goodbye scale.

I spent two days troubleshooting by doing everything including turning off the 5GHz network on my router, removing wifi extenders, and even trying to add the MAC address of the device to the whitelist on the 2.4GHz network. I also used multiple iPhones and iPads to try an perform the setup but once it got to the portion of getting the Netatmo to join the network it failed every time. The only thing these devices had in common was that they were updated to the newest version of the operating system (iOS 13/iPad OS) so I retrieved and older iPad that had not yet been updated and VOILA it worked. So just a public service announcement for anyone who may have been having as much trouble as I have setting up their new device. 

That being said now that I have used the app for a day the only complaint I have is that the security monitoring seems to be a little sensitive and I get notifications for person detected multiple times a day for what turns out to be a shadow. I have turned on the option to allow developers access to analytics in the hope that this software can be improved. I know that Apple recently announced that they are partnering with Netatmo for HomeKit Secure Video to allow for local devices, such as a HomePod or Apple TV, to do the brunt of the analyzing locally so maybe we will even get things such as facial recognition so that we don’t get an alert when a known family member is in the backyard.

This limits the amount of annoying notifications you get on you phone, while being fully aware of what’s going on 24/7.

Huge selling point for me is the snapshots of the object which triggered the movement. I choose to only receive notifications of people detected, and each of those notifications include the name (for the Welcome) or just a close up of the person (for the Presence). Hopefully they’ll be able to carry over some of Welcome’s more advanced recognition to the Presence. I’d buy a Presence 2.0 tomorrow if it had that. Regardless, the current product’s functionality is ahead of most major competitors.

The hardware design and materials are top-notch. Very minimalist (which I prefer), but I can see them losing out on a lot of potential customers. And that’s unfortunate, because this thing is like Ring’s offering but with a head start of about 10 years (if not more, with how their promised HomeKit is going - LOL).

No issues with HomeKit support by the way. Everything registers and integrates as it should with no hiccups. 

Having Ring’s flood cams, at multiple homes, I can definitely say that the two don’t even compare in everyday use ability. Basically the Ring is there to act as a backup of the video security footage, but it’ll only be useful if and when you notice something wrong/suspicious/missing/etc. Otherwise, you’d be spending a few hours a day reviewing mostly useless footage like the morning fog causing the camera to trigger, and send you over a notification with just the words “motion at your home”. 

On the other hand, the Netatmo solution is basically 24/7 *keyword* ACTIVE *keyword* security monitoring. I know of every person that visited my home, and it takes me just a quick second glance to be aware of what’s going on in real-time.

Did I mention there’s no obligation to sign up with a monthly fee in order to receive the full benefits of the product? Or that there’s integration with services that mostly every professional uses nowadays like Dropbox? And local storage or FTP support, in case you don’t want all your files stored somewhere probably not too safe!

Haven’t had a chance to experience customer support due to no issues (other than having weak wifi signal - which isn’t their fault) with a single install or the app. Hope it’ll stay that way!

Seriously, Netatmo just get so many things right that I had to write a review. (And I never do.) It’s just nice and refreshing to see a company with forward-thinking values, and a clear understanding of what people expect from today’s technology put out amazing products to the market.

It looks good and pretty easy to install. The camera is good, the infrared is good except it has a big glowing red light at the front which says to an intruder here I am. Unplug me quick. 

Which comes to the security aspect. For facial recognition to work well you really need to be very close to it in a well lit room. For example i had to make my son stand in front of it, because after 5 days it hadn’t yet detected he was part of the family. 

The other frustration is the pictures of faces it sends you to identify. It only sends a face in a circle the size of penny or 1cent euro coin. So not so bad if you want to identify a person in the family but if it was an intruder it would not be useful for the police. 

That brings me on to the next point. It is possible if the camera catches the crooks eye for the crook to quickly go up to it and unplug it and I am sure in most case it will not have time to send a picture or an alert. 

It is good looking it has a good picture and good infrared image in the dark but it is more of an expensive gadget than a real security camera. 

Recommendations is to have a small battery included so that a picture could be sent if unplugged. 

The ability to click on the faces and see the full picture video can be down loaded still. 

Not sure how to solve the infrared light acting as a beacon.

Can’t opt out - and after paying a premium price, I’m not happy that I’m still targeted. 

2) The recognition algorithm is pretty slick. It can tell the difference of my pet (cats) and people about 99/100. It recognizes my grandson almost immediately, my wife and daughter after about 15-20 minutes. Me? Sometimes not till the end of the day. I can manually set it to say “I’m home”, but I didn’t buy it for me to tell it I’m home. 

Otherwise, it’s pretty slick. The unit is very attractive. With setup I did have to connect it to my laptop via USB cable (it would not work through Bluetooth), but once connected it was a breeze. I would have given this 3 stars but it is cool and *almost* works as advertised.";"2019-06-14T09:02:47-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951725393&type=Purple%20Software";"951725393";165;"en";"POSITIVE"

Every single security cam I’ve tried, including Zmodo, Dlink, Blink, Amazon CloudCam, is capable of detecting motion and sending you an alert.
They all do that way too often and send false positives on a regular basis.
The Netatmo offers a completely different experience: its software is top notch, and is capable of discriminating between animals, people and vehicles.
The timeline of events it presents you shows zoomed up views of the triggering area. Elegant, simple, efficient.
Whereas the Blink I have covering the same area is constantly sending me warnings when tree branches move in the wind or sun glare is misinterpreted as motion, I have yet to receive a single false alarm from the Netatmo. Even better, it has detected animals I couldn’t even see on the video without zooming in.
Expensive, but worth every penny. I would never buy anything else now I know how advanced it is compared to its competition.";"2019-02-14T10:25:06-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951725393&type=Purple%20Software";"951725393";163;"en";"POSITIVE"

It comes with face recognition that work so accurately, just make sure it does not face the TV to avoid false alerts of unknown faces (hope they release an update to add a feature to setup excluding zone), and it store videos in SD card and in Dropbox.

I had it setup that if there is no one at home to store any movement [human, object or pet] in both SD and Dropbox, but only in SD card if we are at home, and also to save unkown faces in Dropbox whether we are home or not.";"2018-09-28T08:07:30-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951725393&type=Purple%20Software";"951725393";116;"en";"POSITIVE"

It has almost everything I need or want. I have tried others as well but this is the one I am keeping and thinking on getting a second one.  

If you have any Questions you can respond to my review and I will try to answer.
