Everyone involved in developing this worthless drivel need to be given Pink Slips £ escorted to the exit immediately. It is unfathomable that Logitech is associated with this nonsense.
It is bad enough that there is no way to extinguish that obnoxious sound that it makes when turning on or off and no AUX jack/port on the UE Megaboom to connect directly but this is putting rock salt into a gunshot wound £ stitching it closed. Also, it will no longer connect via bluetooth to my MacBook Pro. I tried to return the speaker but it was beyond the return date. [yea, I did the dance through the website] The software, once downloaded onto my iPhone, never shows the MegaBoom in the bluetooth window. This is worse than the KEF LSX attempt at a bluetooth app.
Yes, my bluetooth function works because I writing this message with my Logitech K760 Solar Keyboard via bluetooth.
RECOMMENDATION: Burn this disaster of an attempt at a bluetooth app. AND burn the draft boards it was written on. Stick to hardware £ make sure it works. This should be considered an absolute embarrassment for a company such as this. Spend you money JBL if you want to connect via cable. Otherwise, if it is in the budget, get a pair of PSB, ELAC or Klipsch active speakers if you do not necessarily need portability.";"2021-07-04T14:13:14-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=632344648&type=Purple%20Software";"632344648";238;"en";"NEGATIVE"

Audio quality and connection should be paramount over all of the other convenience features. It shouldn't be an iterative process to successfully get 3 speakers partied up and by no means should any have audio cutting out while sitting next to one another fully charged playing music (5G WiFi, downloaded tracks, whatever, there's a codec issue here).

The app looks nice and all but at the end of the day all I'm looking for is a high quality stable connection between multiple speakers. If I need to physically get up and walk over to turn one on/off or adjust the volume so be it. EQ, nice to have but I'll trade it any day for rock solid audio with no cutouts. Requiring the app to parry up may look cool with the dots and all, but functions 10x better and consistently on the cheaper wonderboom models (which sadly are limited to 2 max otherwise I'd just buy 8 of them).

Ignore the completion from the likes of Bose, beats, JBL etc.... you have some solid underlying physical engineering that the app doesn't do justice and even detracts from.

This convinced me to go buy the MB3 after thinking about it for several weeks. I happen to have both speakers. Ehhh, NO. The Bose still sounds better IMHO. The most notable thing was that the MB3 lacks bass, even when cranking up the bass on the custom EQ. And the frustrating part is the app. While the app is cool to operate your speaker ie: turn it on/off remotely etc. BUT set the EQ to your custom settings and when done with the speaker, turn it off with the app then turn the speaker back on and guess what! The app does NOT save your custom EQ settings to memory. Nowhere in the app settings can you save your custom EQ to memory. I turned the speaker on and off several times just to make sure and sure enough, those custom EQ settings were gone every time. This was a major pain. Portable speakers like these will never fill a room full of REALLY LOUD music; I get that. But at least make it crank the bass so it won’t sound like music coming from a tin can.

However, the single “magic button” one button on the top of the speaker which is supposed to control music from the speaker without needing to access your device, can only do two things - press once to play or pause, tap twice to skip to next track. Tapping three times does nothing; upon reading the support page, it turns out “previous track” is not a function on this device, anything other than play\pause or next track must be done from your device. In addition, most accessories which use this single\double\triple tap system allow you to hold the second (or third) tap down as a press in order to (respectively) fast forward or rewind within a track. The speaker supports neither of these either.

After I did the update, the speakers power started draining like crazy in its off state.  I left the power for both speaker in the “soft-off” state at 70%/40% battery for UE Megaboom and UE Boom.  5 days later with 0 usage, the battery went down to 40% and 20% respectively!!  This is a TERRIBLE NEW FEATURE!   Please add back the ability to turn off the ability to remote turn on the speaker.  After I did a hard reset on the speakers, I left them unused for 2 weeks, and the battery is still 40%/20% today.  I re-paired them today to my phone.

All it does now is hiccup every 1-3 minutes through a song and it’s very annoying. Plus the Bass response isn’t anyway near what it used to be.

#3 After the latest update, PartyUp doesn’t work. The screen to add speakers has a gray bar at the bottom and if I try to scroll up I can see half of all my other UEBOOMS but I get an error. 

#4 What happened to the option in PartyUp that allowed the sound to be switched between true stereo and normal sound when you have only two UEBOOMS connected? 

#5 The new app logo looks terrible!! Very unpleasant. The old app icon was much nicer. 

#6 Why do I need a different app for every speaker?? Surely there is a designer out there that can come up with one app that allows you to control all the UEBOOMS together. 

#7 I had to turn off the Alert Sounds because now they all play at maximum volume. It’s very startling when the speaker makes an alert sound at the highest volume even though the speaker is turned all the way down.

I decided to go to the MegaBoom’s speaker window. For grins, I decided to touch the party icon.  Ha!Ha! The party screen shows the megaBoom is connected. So I touched the appropriate app icons on the iPhone screen to start the party with the MegaBoom speaker and all the other speakers. All 3 speakers started playing.

It isn't the biggest inconvenience in the world to have to go back to my iPod's  built in speaker, but once a guy gets used to something he's going to want it to stick around. I've been a happy customer ever since the first iteration of the Boom, the first model became my alarm and backup speaker. I really love the product and want to see the companion application do well. If it's because of IOS11 then I'm out of luck because my iPod is full to the brim and has no space to accommodate the update. I hope a patch of some kind gets released soon.";"2017-10-23T03:06:18-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=632344648&type=Purple%20Software";"632344648";187;"en";"POSITIVE"

Contacted UE & got a fix. Listed below are the EXACT steps I took, in order (hope it works for you):
-""Forget this device"" in Bluetooth settings (can't recall if I did this before or after the next step; probably shldn't matter)
-Updated my iPhone iOS
-Uninstalled/deleted Boom app
-Reinstalled Boom app
-Reset speaker to factory (even tho I already did): Boom shld be on; hold ""volume down"" + ""power"" button simultaneously until you hear weird sounds; device will turn off.
-Opened app, selected my device (Boom/Boom 2), went to phone BT settings, turned on Boom 2, held pairing button until it started flashing/pair mode
-Connected to Boom 2
-Returned to app (I DID NOT use the multitasking swipe, but instead found the app & opened it manually, to avoid potential glitches)
-Boom was connected to app, all is good in the world

Suggestions:
1.) Make the app scale correctly for every apple screen size.
2.) Make an app that is compatible for the iPad! Using the iPhone app on this feels awkward. 
3.) Access volume on the main screen of the app. 
4.) Add more features to the Alarm clock. (I would like to be able to see different times for each day of the week). Also if UE boom marketed more how this can be used as an alarm clock I think more people would buy this. When I show that feature to people they want to get one as well.
5.) Add the ability to assign apple ringtones or alarm alerts as a default alarm sounds.

I can futz with it and get the first speaker to see that another speaker is available, often even by having to re-broadcast the Bluetooth signal, and drag that speaker up to connect in stereo — but doing this nearly every time I play music is ridiculous.

I bought a pair of Megaboom speakers for my mom. She loves them — but has the same trouble getting the app to pair them and just play the music on both speakers in stereo. Actually she has trouble getting the app to just play on the speakers.

Lately, I've had need of it at home with my little one. She has trouble feeding unless we start her off with a copious amount of shushing. When I get shushed out, I have to use an app that has white noise as a feature. Sometimes, I need to boost the volume of this app to the maximum in order for her to respond positively. Sadly and most irritatingly, the new software and firmware update to the device prevents the ability to shut off the alert sounds. This makes it so the resultant 'BOOP' alert sounds off and pisses off both my little one and my wife. Not good. I return to the app and shut off alert sounds, and the sounds re-enable after the unit is shut off. 

We can't use it as the dynamic device Logitech wants us to believe it is. It may sound great on the bike listening to the Beatles, Meshuggah and Mozart but if you have to use it at home and hate the alert sounds, it's ƃuıʞɔnɟ rubbish.

Original review:
Only the last speaker I used appears on the list to turn on a speaker. This makes it impossible to turn on different speakers around my house with the app. Of course, I can turn on all the speakers with the party up, but I don’t want to do that except on rare occasions.

Specifically- naming of the speakers doesn’t always show, it doesn’t allow to update the speakers consistently (out of 5, 1 might not allow a firmware update at this time).

I just bought Megaboom 3, added it to the app, to run “party” Stereo, Double - the app at many times loses connection to one of the speakers, them that blows up your other connection to the other speaker. At best you have to shut down and manually turn off all your speakers then relaunch.

The sound for “double” & “stereo” would be great if it worked and didn’t have the cracking on the 2nd speaker you’re adding. It’s a connectivity issue - app is most frustrating than helpful and that’s too bad

Yes, this one looks nice and is all pretty and makes it very easy to pair up 2 speakers.

New apps should not take away functionality. I had originally contacted support thinking I had missed the button somewhere. A week later I got an auto reply to “explore the faq page”. Well... I went back to the change log.
