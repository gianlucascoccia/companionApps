We have over 30 smart devices in our home and the only ones we have any issues with are Whirlpools. Awful, shameful and extremely disappointing. A recall, reimbursement, or lawsuit should be next. 

***If anyone has discovered how to get notifications on two phones please leave it in a review. So far no matter what we do, only one person can receive notifications.***

Well, I feel ripped off. It was an extra $50 each on the washer and dryer for the smart feature. Notifications did work for a while, but only on one of our devices. I guess you can't have more than one person getting notifications? The send to appliance has never worked, and notifications have stopped completely. So...the extra $100 plus tax was a waste.

In addition, the remote start constantly disconnects, I have to reenable it on the oven(s) every few days. This problem also cascades to Alexa, which makes this feature useless since you can‚Äôt actually remote start.

Finally I get to the controls for the oven(s), when you go to an appliance they‚Äôve wasted the entire screen with a picture of an oven and give you one small terse button under something called ‚Äúshortcuts‚Äù that says ‚Äúsee all oven features‚Äù.

‚ÄúDear Developer‚Äù Thanks for the response. Obviously I tried the free version,  but you give me 6 months to try the service. I don‚Äôt plan to own this appliance for 6 months.

I was not super impressed with the app but it was functional. The watch app was one of the reasons we were excited about the connected features, to receive notifications on the watch was huge!  We do NOT have Alexa or Google devices in our home, but we have Apple products. 

A few days after getting everything going and the app was updated. Not for the better, it is slow to launch, and navigate to appliances. The watch app is now gone.  It appears to be more of an advertisement then utility. Functions the were a few clicks away are now several clicks away, which is not an improvement. Adding nice photography does not improve the user experience. 

Also, when logged into the app it still requires a logging to access account features like privacy feature. Again, not user friendly design.  

I can only hope the app become more useful. Currently, it does not promote the use of connected appliances.";"2020-12-18T13:28:56-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1011622189&type=Purple%20Software";"1011622189";170;"en";"POSITIVE"

It has some bugs, including that the scan-to-cook feature often reports the microwave is in use when it is not. The microwave status shows ‚Äúidle‚Äù and pressing scan-to-cook just pops up a message saying the appliance is running. I have to then actually use the appliance to heat something, and at the end of that cycle, scan-to-cook will work. But it really doesn‚Äôt matter because the scan-to-cook feature is nearly worthless anyway. I‚Äôve scanned the entire contents of my freezer and found only 2 items that were recognized. Major national brands like Green Giant, Banquet, Marie Calendar, and TGI Friday‚Äôs were not recognized. The same was true for major retailer‚Äôs house brands, like WalMart, Meier, and Kroger - none were recognized. But if all you have to heat are Boston Market or Lean Cuisine frozen entrees, those worked, so you‚Äôre all set. The next time I‚Äôm at the store, I‚Äôm going to scan the pizza bites that Whirlpool shows in the demo video for scan-to-cook to see if they actually work, and my bet is that they will not be recognized. The app lets you enter cooking instructions manually and save them as a favorite, but this is obviously meant for ovens rather than microwaves as only whole minute increments are allowed. How about allowing the app to save a barcode, name it, and manually enter the cooking instructions including seconds if the library of supported brands is going to be so small? Better still, an interactive feature allowing users to upload their scanned items and cooking instructions to grow your library would be great.";"2020-10-17T04:48:03-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1011622189&type=Purple%20Software";"1011622189";285;"en";"POSITIVE"

It took several months of trial and error just to connect the appliances to Wi-Fi. Lessons learned: you may need to use the WPS feature on your router to connect. Therefore the WPS feature on your router must be enabled through your router settings online. Secondly and even more technical, you may need to connect to your appliance IP through the Internet with a laptop or pc from your home network before you can connect via any mobile devices. Lastly it only works on 2.4 Wi-Fi. Your mobile device must be on the same channel. In summary Wi-Fi connection to your appliances using this app is far to technical and complicated for the average appliance owner. 

Only Minimal Wi-Fi features are functional. The application will not allow setting any of the appliance specific ‚Äúpreferences‚Äù without returning the error code ‚ÄúError updating appliance preferences. Please try again later‚Äù.... Later has come and gone over the past year. I have submitted several work orders with whirlpool that have only wasted my time without any resolution. Previous open tickets with Whirlpool tech support have been closed without resolving the issue. They did not attempt to contact me in regard to any of the open tickets they closed. 

Checking for software updates via this app will crash the application and you will need to force close the application. The software update seems to be unresponsive from the preferences menu. It just says loading for a few seconds and disappears without any update notices. When you go back one menu then the software update notice finally appears stating software is up to date. The ‚Äúdismiss notice‚Äù radio button does nothing and the application becomes unresponsive (crashes). You must then force close the application and log back in. 

The Whirlpool tech support frequently fails to correctly identify these issues. So there can simply be no resolve if the issue is not accurately identified. I get an overwhelming perception that Whirlpool tech support Representatives simply don‚Äôt care. This has been the case for several help tickets. Today I spoke with a Whirlpool representative again who failed to listen and continuously spoke over me with erroneous feedback and unskilled understanding of the problem. He eventually initiated an argument with me until I demanded to speak with a lead. The lead however was receptive and effectively documented the problem. 

These Wi-Fi appliances along with this application were chosen to improve the quality of life for a disabled Veteran with traumatic head injuries. He needs the advantages of Wi-Fi augmented devices to cook and clean however this defective application and the inability of Whirlpool to effectively and efficiently resolve systemic technical problems has become a real nightmare for this Veteran who has invested his savings of $6,000 on worthless mobile application enabled appliances. 

I would strongly advise looking elsewhere for applications and supported Wi-Fi enabled devices. Whirlpool Corp is clearly lagging far behind in this age of technology in that regard.";"2019-11-11T13:33:35-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1011622189&type=Purple%20Software";"1011622189";501;"en";"NEGATIVE"

Via another support session with Whirlpool‚Äôs IoT support staff, I can now report a successful connection between the microwave and the app. I was told their engineers changed some things on the back end.

I would still insist that the setup requirement that both the phone and appliance are on the same 2.4GHz network is absurd. Many new routers support both bands, and there‚Äôs no way to tell an iPhone ‚Äú...connect only to 2.4GHz WiFi...‚Äù I get it that the appliance is limited to using only 2.4GHz WiFi, but it shouldn‚Äôt matter what frequency band the iPhone is using, as long as they are both on the same network.

Developers should look at the setup process for a TP-Link Kasa smart WiFi plug. I set one up yesterday with the smart plug on the 2.4GHz band and my phone on the 5GHz band, and the setup process was quick and painless.

All the above being said, I‚Äôm revising my rating of this app from 1 star to 2.

We are now at the 6 month point since I first tried to connect our microwave, and several sessions with Whirlpool‚Äôs IoT support team have failed to resolve the issue.

Our Orbi system provides WiFi over 2 frequencies, 2.4GHz and 5GHz, acting as one network with one SSID. The setup calls for both the mobile device and microwave to be on the same 2.4GHz network. 

I don‚Äôt know if this is true with Android phones or not, but it isn‚Äôt possible in iOS to select a specific frequency band...my iPhone will always connect to the 5GHz band.

So that‚Äôs a problem right away!

Help from NETGEAR showed me how to temporarily turn off the 5GHz band, and I tried this during one of the support sessions with Whirlpool, but I‚Äôm still not able to connect the phone to the microwave ‚Äòs network.

So I‚Äôm stuck with an appliance that connects to my WiFi just fine, but won‚Äôt connect to my phone....rendering the WiFi connection completely useless.
