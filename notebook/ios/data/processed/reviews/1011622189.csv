After I down loaded the app and went through the clunky process of registration then pairing (a lot of UI improvements needed here) I finally got to where I was supposed to connect to my home wireless, this is where I was presented with the “free trial” screen.. what a rip off!! After paying over a thousand bucks each for the washer and dryer I have to pay a monthly subscription to connect to mobile device!

Maybe they will improve the app - by first making it to where you can truly control the washer using the app without the need to first turn the machine on and then press enable ON THE MACHINE!  👀.

***If anyone has discovered how to get notifications on two phones please leave it in a review. So far no matter what we do, only one person can receive notifications.***

Well, I feel ripped off. It was an extra $50 each on the washer and dryer for the smart feature. Notifications did work for a while, but only on one of our devices. I guess you can't have more than one person getting notifications? The send to appliance has never worked, and notifications have stopped completely. So...the extra $100 plus tax was a waste.

They brought the guessing game into the app as well, there’s no status indicator telling you the oven is on or off, it just says “ready to cook”. One oven is on, the other off but they both show the same text. The app has this huge useless slide up thing that has static links to different blog posts on their site which would be fine if it didn’t make you think it was there to control the appliance.

In addition, the remote start constantly disconnects, I have to reenable it on the oven(s) every few days. This problem also cascades to Alexa, which makes this feature useless since you can’t actually remote start.

Finally I get to the controls for the oven(s), when you go to an appliance they’ve wasted the entire screen with a picture of an oven and give you one small terse button under something called “shortcuts” that says “see all oven features”. Just list them in all that extra space you used to show me what a oven looks like.

A few days after getting everything going and the app was updated. Not for the better, it is slow to launch, and navigate to appliances. The watch app is now gone.  It appears to be more of an advertisement then utility. Functions the were a few clicks away are now several clicks away, which is not an improvement. Adding nice photography does not improve the user experience. 

Also, when logged into the app it still requires a logging to access account features like privacy feature. Again, not user friendly design.  

I can only hope the app become more useful. Currently, it does not promote the use of connected appliances.";"2020-12-18T13:28:56-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1011622189&type=Purple%20Software";"1011622189";170;"en";"POSITIVE"

381;6544418706;"GoBucks2017";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id22240826";"4.6.4";2;"I expected much more";"The app functions and connects to my convection microwave, but that’s as much good as I can say for it. It has some bugs, including that the scan-to-cook feature often reports the microwave is in use when it is not. The microwave status shows “idle” and pressing scan-to-cook just pops up a message saying the appliance is running. I have to then actually use the appliance to heat something, and at the end of that cycle, scan-to-cook will work. But it really doesn’t matter because the scan-to-cook feature is nearly worthless anyway. I’ve scanned the entire contents of my freezer and found only 2 items that were recognized. Major national brands like Green Giant, Banquet, Marie Calendar, and TGI Friday’s were not recognized. The same was true for major retailer’s house brands, like WalMart, Meier, and Kroger - none were recognized. But if all you have to heat are Boston Market or Lean Cuisine frozen entrees, those worked, so you’re all set. The next time I’m at the store, I’m going to scan the pizza bites that Whirlpool shows in the demo video for scan-to-cook to see if they actually work, and my bet is that they will not be recognized. The app lets you enter cooking instructions manually and save them as a favorite, but this is obviously meant for ovens rather than microwaves as only whole minute increments are allowed. How about allowing the app to save a barcode, name it, and manually enter the cooking instructions including seconds if the library of supported brands is going to be so small? Better still, an interactive feature allowing users to upload their scanned items and cooking instructions to grow your library would be great.";"2020-10-17T04:48:03-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1011622189&type=Purple%20Software";"1011622189";285;"en";"POSITIVE"

It took several months of trial and error just to connect the appliances to Wi-Fi. Lessons learned: you may need to use the WPS feature on your router to connect. Therefore the WPS feature on your router must be enabled through your router settings online. Secondly and even more technical, you may need to connect to your appliance IP through the Internet with a laptop or pc from your home network before you can connect via any mobile devices. Lastly it only works on 2.4 Wi-Fi. Your mobile device must be on the same channel. In summary Wi-Fi connection to your appliances using this app is far to technical and complicated for the average appliance owner. 

Only Minimal Wi-Fi features are functional. The application will not allow setting any of the appliance specific “preferences” without returning the error code “Error updating appliance preferences. Please try again later”.... Later has come and gone over the past year. I have submitted several work orders with whirlpool that have only wasted my time without any resolution. Previous open tickets with Whirlpool tech support have been closed without resolving the issue. They did not attempt to contact me in regard to any of the open tickets they closed. 

Checking for software updates via this app will crash the application and you will need to force close the application. The software update seems to be unresponsive from the preferences menu. It just says loading for a few seconds and disappears without any update notices. When you go back one menu then the software update notice finally appears stating software is up to date. The “dismiss notice” radio button does nothing and the application becomes unresponsive (crashes). You must then force close the application and log back in. 

The Whirlpool tech support frequently fails to correctly identify these issues. So there can simply be no resolve if the issue is not accurately identified. I get an overwhelming perception that Whirlpool tech support Representatives simply don’t care. This has been the case for several help tickets. Today I spoke with a Whirlpool representative again who failed to listen and continuously spoke over me with erroneous feedback and unskilled understanding of the problem. He eventually initiated an argument with me until I demanded to speak with a lead. The lead however was receptive and effectively documented the problem. 

These Wi-Fi appliances along with this application were chosen to improve the quality of life for a disabled Veteran with traumatic head injuries. He needs the advantages of Wi-Fi augmented devices to cook and clean however this defective application and the inability of Whirlpool to effectively and efficiently resolve systemic technical problems has become a real nightmare for this Veteran who has invested his savings of $6,000 on worthless mobile application enabled appliances. 

I would strongly advise looking elsewhere for applications and supported Wi-Fi enabled devices.

I was able to scan the code in this app, eventually connect to WiFi, and then the oven said the app and oven were finally connected. Great. I go back to my app and unfortunately my app disagreed with my oven and still showed no devices. Ok I’ll just scan the code again:
 - oh wait, I already connected to WiFi so the code is now hidden. Great choice there app developers 👍. I guess I’ll just type in a bunch of digits inconveniently. Ok I typed in the SAID (and MAC which it doesn’t tel you to explicitly put in but leaves you to figure that out on your own). Now the oven will connect, right?  Ha, good one. Now I have to spend the rest of my day figuring out why it still won’t connect.

Via another support session with Whirlpool’s IoT support staff, I can now report a successful connection between the microwave and the app. I was told their engineers changed some things on the back end.

I would still insist that the setup requirement that both the phone and appliance are on the same 2.4GHz network is absurd. Many new routers support both bands, and there’s no way to tell an iPhone “...connect only to 2.4GHz WiFi...” I get it that the appliance is limited to using only 2.4GHz WiFi, but it shouldn’t matter what frequency band the iPhone is using, as long as they are both on the same network.

Developers should look at the setup process for a TP-Link Kasa smart WiFi plug. I set one up yesterday with the smart plug on the 2.4GHz band and my phone on the 5GHz band, and the setup process was quick and painless.

All the above being said, I’m revising my rating of this app from 1 star to 2.

We are now at the 6 month point since I first tried to connect our microwave, and several sessions with Whirlpool’s IoT support team have failed to resolve the issue.

Our Orbi system provides WiFi over 2 frequencies, 2.4GHz and 5GHz, acting as one network with one SSID. The setup calls for both the mobile device and microwave to be on the same 2.4GHz network. 

I don’t know if this is true with Android phones or not, but it isn’t possible in iOS to select a specific frequency band...my iPhone will always connect to the 5GHz band.

So that’s a problem right away!

Help from NETGEAR showed me how to temporarily turn off the 5GHz band, and I tried this during one of the support sessions with Whirlpool, but I’m still not able to connect the phone to the microwave ‘s network.

So I’m stuck with an appliance that connects to my WiFi just fine, but won’t connect to my phone....rendering the WiFi connection completely useless.

Buyer beware.";"2018-12-12T12:55:23-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1011622189&type=Purple%20Software";"1011622189";338;"en";"POSITIVE"

It damaged the oven beyond repair, so we had to replace it.  My recommendation is to not use the software.  It is possibly safer to just use the manual controls.

Update 12/02/18:

We got a new oven from Whirlpool.  The oven works, but I have given up using the app.  The app is poorly made, it is counter intuitive.  I certainly do not trust the app to control the function of the oven.  Further, the oven is continuously disconnecting itself from the WiFi.
