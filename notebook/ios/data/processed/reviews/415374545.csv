I am now seeking proposals to remove all the RadioRA2 gear, sell it on eBay, and put in any competing system that does not treat their customers like we are incapable of simple tasks.  To be clear, this update removes the feature allowing an end user to tweak the lighting levels in their button panels.  I have scenes and lighting levels that I adjust seasonally.  I have timers and modes that I enable when I travel.  I now am unable to adjust lighting levels for thesis buttons, and am also unable to tell Lutron that I am ""away"" thus enabling my custom timers to mimic the behavior of being home.  I have no idea why Lutron would remove such useful functionality, other than to generate revenue for their installers (who are too busy to come over to make such minor tweaks), or if it's simply that they think the end user is too stupid to handle basic features.  
The ability to do these things from the iPad app was highlighted as a key feature in the marketing material and was a primary reason I selected Lutron.  I will never buy another product from them again unless this gets fixed within the next 90 days (the amount of time it will take me to select and schedule an installation of a competing product).

To use this app you specify separate telnet logins for the main repeater for each iPhone/iPad. Actually you have to reveal your password to your dealer/installer since Lutron does not release the main repeater programming software to homeowners.  The static IP in the main repeater also can only be changed by the dealer because this is configured by the programming software, so you can't manage your own network without babysitting from your dealer.  Lutron should have implemented a protocol that can share a login with multiple devices (not telnet) and allow the homeowner to enter logins and change static IP without the dealer involved. I got this working on a router with Tomato firmware so this will work across different types of routers. Note: you must configure one of the hardware keypads in the programming software in order to avoid a configuration error, even if the iPad/iPhone is your only keypad.

Technically, it is true but very conveniently left out the fact that it will require VPN which most home user will not have due to dynamic IP and complicated setup. So now after few long years they decided to offer alternative without VPN but with a fee of $59 per year.

Also, you will have to make sure your RadioRA 2 software is the latest version 6.0 or it will not work. You will have to call your Lutron rep to upgrade the software as they don't let you do that in your own. This will take another 24 hours at least if you are lucky.

Lutron, You'll get your $ from those that sign up for remote login. Either that or create in-app purchase to activate scene editing. 

Fairly easy to use and edit lighting scenes however there isn't a way to add lighting loads to scenes that weren't originally programmed using the configuration software. 

HVAC control capabilities are ok but seem to respond wonky. Feedback doesn't always emulate what the Honeywell T-Stat does and sometimes requires 2 button presses. 

I REALLY don't like the fact that temperature icons show up in areas that don't have HVAC. Why do I need temperature controls in my Landscape zone?? HVAC icon should only show up in room that has the thermostat!! Not in unrelated rooms. 

I also don't like that all controlled devices use a lightbulb icon. I have fans and relays on the system and by them being listed as lights causes confusion. 

Still, a reasonable effort but doesn't stand out against competing platforms. Get to work Lutron!!";"2014-09-05T10:37:33-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=415374545&type=Purple%20Software";"415374545";170;"en";"NEGATIVE"

I can use my Lutron’s old, non-mobile web server on my iPhone faster than this app! So now I’m paying for a worse experience than an old, out-of-date, non-mobile web server.

One has to navigate by floor, then room, then switch, then click the desired button. Just to turn a light on. Nope.

You can make only one plate/switch a favorite and that’s it. So your Lutron experience is spent navigating back and forth in text menus.

Why can’t we favorite a bunch of buttons that all appear on a favorites panel? That alone would make this app usable. But instead, Lutron wants us to pay an installer to make a panel of favorites, which we can only update with a programmer visit. What a pain - no thank you.

Come on Lutron, step up to the plate and make an app that’s easy and efficient. This one isn’t.";"2014-08-05T13:17:43-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=415374545&type=Purple%20Software";"415374545";161;"en";"POSITIVE"

Pros- the best thing is to be able to set and change the scene levels from the app.  If you don't have the app, you have to have a tech set them and you are stuck.  So pay the 20, it is cheaper then the service call.  

Cons- with what the system costs, it is a ripoff to have to pay 20 for the app.  At 175 to 400 for light switches and key pads, toss it in.  It is worthless to anyone that does not have the system, so who cares.  That said, with what I paid for the system, what's another 20.  

My biggest complaint is that Lurton wants you to have to call your dealer and line their pocket anytime you want to program or change something.  All switches and shades should be accessible from the app and the user should be able to add them or remove them from a scene.  

This is an even bigger annoyance because my dealer is horrible and I am stuck calling them to make a change.  They have the program and how it is set.  To get someone else to do it I have to call another dealer and they would need to reprogram it all.  

Lurton has a great product, but it is designed to protect their dealers.   I have tried to get in touch with someone at lutron to discuss my dealer but you cannot get through to anyone that matters.

I digress, basically, if you have the system, you need the app.  Pay the 20, don't pay 60 per year more for remote.  That is a ripoff solely for lutron to keep making money.  

If you have not gone with the ra2 yet, go with something else.  There are systems just as good that cost less and are mores end user friendly.";"2013-02-26T20:02:33-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=415374545&type=Purple%20Software";"415374545";322;"en";"POSITIVE"

I changed my review from 1 star to 4 stars. I am a HUGE RadioRA 2 fan and I did not want my 1 star review and comment regarding ""Apple Watch support being removed"" to in any way be a reflection on the Lutron System as a whole. True these reviews are supposed to be for the App but this is unique in that it is one of the few apps on the App Store that work along with an external system. 
Lutron System = 5 stars
Lutron App (when/if Apple Watch support is restored) = 5 stars

Huge thanks to Mike S. from Lutron for responding to my post.

The app itself is slow to load, ludicrously expensive at $59.99 / year, and ultimately offers less customization that good ole plug-in vacation timers. 

Lutron insults their customers two ways: first, they don't allow you to customize your own system (you have to put in a service call to one of their Lutron technicians at $100+ an hour for any modifications), and second you are reminded of the lack of customization every single time you log into the app.

For instance, I wanted to create a new away mode ""scene."" I am not talking major changes to the program here. All I want to do is set up an occasional vacation mode using the app. Imagine paying thousands of dollars for a system, and the app won't even let you program a vacation mode! It's utterly maddening. 

Of course, you can chose not to purchase the app, and then you are left with a bunch of hand-operated light switches that cost you thousands of dollars. 

As soon as we can find another home automation system that suits our needs, we're ripping this stuff out, and starting anew. This app and it's costs are simply awful. For the amount of money the system costs we shouldn't be nickeled and dimed just to use it.";"2014-10-21T18:47:13-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=415374545&type=Purple%20Software";"415374545";235;"en";"NEGATIVE"
