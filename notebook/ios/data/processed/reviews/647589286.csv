First, the app doesn’t allow me to turn my pump on AFTER opening a valve.  This causes my system pressure to rise to 130 psi for 4-5 seconds until the valve opens and returns to normal which is 25 psi. This over pressure situation happens at the beginning and end of each cycle.  Not everyone needs this functionality, but everyone in my community (central FL with well and pump) does... and I think a S/W update would fix it.  Also, connecting the device to my wifi was frustrating.  I literally ran through the setup sequence- which did not fully conform to the instructions- over a dozen times before it connected.  I would have quit earlier but my other crappy device (a pet feeder) gave me the same trouble so I stuck it out and just kept trying until it connected.  Recently we lost power for over an hour causing the rain machine to lose connection.  Reconnecting it to wifi again frustrated me nearly to the point of tossing it out.  I’ve had an automatic sprinkler system for many years and this controller is really no better than the previous ones except for the convenience of accessing it through my phone.  I’m prompted to call it ‘average’.

No more spending a half an hour in the basement trying to change my schedule because it’s getting hotter and no more stupid wireless rain sensor messing up my watering schedule. I connected zone to my garden drip system this year and my garden has never looked better. It’s really cool that I can stand in my garden and if it needs more water I can just press a button on my phone. Just yesterday my landscapers wanted to put fertilizer on the lawn but needed me to water it first and I was able to do that from work. The best part is being able to stop watering when I want to take a shower and the water pressure is low because the sprinklers are on. The only problem is that the snooze button does not work for programs that are actively on....if they add that function I would give it 5 stars and paid more money!

All other automated WiFi connections within the home  are working fine, but the Rainmaker panel can not hold a WiFi signal. I have had the local cable company who services our WiFi come out  several times and the unit continues to fail holding a continual WiFi signal. It is worth the effort to research other similar products within the competitive market before purchasing Rainmaker. They have a 2.8 rating out of 5. That should be concerning  to you if making a decision to purchase a unit such as this. I bought Rainmaker without doing my homework and troubles me for not following through on other similar products. Especially with the money i spent for the unit and installation. Best of luck to all! Also the amount of watering this year from the unit saturated my yard and now have water in my cellar. The sump pump was dry for years unit I had this unit installed. It’s a false sense of security and I will eventually go back to a manual watering panel. The developers are dedicated to fix all the bugs, and intentions are honorable, but in the mean time with all the bata fixes and more, my unit is not working!

I had to call the support line multiple times and they didn’t even understand that was what was needed to be done.  After multiple frustrating calls I actually figured it out myself.  

Also, every year when I start my system up I have some sort problem.  This year, about a week ago everything seemed fine, then today I tried to water an individual zone and I got the “infinite thinking circle” that wouldn’t let me do anything.  I tried rebooting, didn’t work, tried turning phone on and off, didn’t work, tried reinstalling app, didn’t work.  Finally I reset the controller and went completely through setup and that worked.

It might have been really useful but falls short due to very poor scheduling algorithms. On the surface, they claim to take into account a multitude of parameters like rain amount, evaporation rate, and other factors affecting moisture retention. In reality, the scheduling makes no sense.  I’m not sure if basic sanity checks were ever done, let alone comprehensive performance testing. Today we got 2.3 inches of rain as recorded by the connected rain gauge. For whatever reason, instead of using the actual measurement they somehow came up with 1.5 in of rain.  Even with that number, one expects that watering should be paused for a while. But no - I have scheduled 150% watering for tomorrow, and 100% two days after that. I had to deactivate the program to prevent this insanity. 
In summary - if you need a device that you can manually control with your phone it will do the trick. If you want to rely on some “smart” scheduling you are out of luck. Congratulations - you bought yourself an irrigation system remote! This is why I give some credit to the app - not a bad remote and has some graphs too...

Spinning, loading, it takes forever to do anything because all it does is spins. I eventually have to close it to start at the next task I was attempting to do in the app. This is the case with all of mine, even the ones that are wired with Ethernet.  The Wi-Fi connection process takes forever retrying over and over (and over) until it finally works. I have an access point that is direct wired and within 10 feet of the unit (mounted outdoors) and it still wants to connect to an access point 400ft away with terrible connection. The Wi-Fi is probably the software on the unit but because you can’t properly configure it with the app I blame it. Once you do finally trick it to connect to the close one by turning off all others the app loads and spins. Clearly I’m not the only one with these problems. Read the other reviews.

App works well when trying to connect to the controller when you are on the same wifi but if you're away from your wifi network prepare to spend a few minutes continually trying to connect!
Some of the apps placement of features make no sense, ie where it shows if your lawn was watered. The graphs are a nice touch but aren't that easy to read and it would be nice to see more aggregated data and colors so you can see what it's using to determine watering.
All in all it is doing (so far) what the app and controller have promised but I think they have a lot of refinement and fixes still on their roadmap for future releases (I hope at least).";"2015-09-29T20:26:36-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=647589286&type=Purple%20Software";"647589286";181;"en";"POSITIVE"

If you make a change to a zone such as disable ""weather adaptive"" then you have to step 2 screens deep in that zone and save twice even though you didn't make changes on the 1st screen otherwise your change isn't saved. 

If you water extra by manually starting the saved schedule on the same day it has already run the app won't show that you watered more than 100%. 

You have to take the sprinkler controller off your wifi and connect directly to your smart phone for it to perform a backup so you can restore the latest controller changes in the event of an extended power outage.

The graphs are as basic as it gets.

We have received 3"" of rain this evening and the app still shows it will run a full schedule tonight because it hasn't updated any of the enabled weather data servers in 4 hours yet it's WIFI access to the internet hasn't missed a beat and there is no way to force an update.

I simply wanted to be able to control sprinklers via my iPhone (and avoid having to go to the basement to change sprinkler settings or activate).  If things do not improve, I probably will install original timer and return the Rain Machine.

It would be nice to show when your programs actually run (e.g. If you say run every third unless you remember the cycle you have no way to see when that program last ran). There is no historical data in the app, you need to go to the device to see it and the graphs are pretty small.

- The RainMachine hardware is surprisingly easy to install, even for a home-repair-challenged guy like me.
- Quick system setup.
- Instant WiFi connection.
- Beautiful, informative, intuitive app.
- Historical watering data provided.
- System can also be accessed via the Internet.

CONS: 
- The app always opens up to the DEVICE screen and makes you choose which RainMachine device you want to control. (Seriously, how many people actually have more than ONE of these?) This is a totally pointless step. It would be a much better user experience if they would add an option in Settings that allowed us to choose which screen we wanted to see first when we open the app. I can't imagine any homeowner in the world actually WANTING to see this screen. It's waste of time forcing us to ""choose"" the device every single time we open the app when we only have ONE device! Why not take us directly to the Dashboard screen? We've been asking for this change forever, but they keep ignoring us!
- We shouldn't have to go into Settings to see our Watering History. This really should be another graphical section on the Dashboard screen that we can tap on to see more detailed info. One of the main things we want to see when we quickly pop into this app is, ""What have the watering patterns looked like over the past week/month?"" Besides, ""watering history"" is NOT a ""Setting"" anyway.

The bottom line is, I'm thrilled with this product, and only wish I'd gotten it sooner! The ability to check on my system from anywhere and make whatever schedule changes I want to from my phone is extremely helpful. If you're on the fence about buying this... DO IT! You'll be so glad you did! The developers have been totally unresponsive to communication so far, and that does worry me, but I hope they will fix these problems I've mentioned soon to make this a truly deserving 5-star app.";"2017-02-16T15:19:09-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=647589286&type=Purple%20Software";"647589286";333;"en";"POSITIVE"

The Good: The app has never failed to allow me to control my watering system. Even more importantly, so far the watering system itself has worked as advertised.

The Bad: There have been occasions where I needed to forcably close the app to get it to connect or get some piece of the UI unstuck. The UI itself occasionally seems to be missing pieces. (For instance, under Settings > Weather, the app currently tells me I've changed the ""field capacity"" from it's default, but the app no longer seems to have any UI to change this setting. Also of note, unfortunately this setting itself behaves somewhat oddly and even when set to 1 day will prevent potted plants that need and are otherwise set for daily watering from being watered up to 4 days after the last rain during the winter, when it's colder outside.)

The Ugly: The app really doesn't conform to iOS look and feel, using familiar UI elements that act in very non-iOS ways. Appearance-wise, the app isn't even entirely consistent with itself, using a mess of different font sizes and control styles. Also, the app seems to assume, somewhat strangely, that there's a good change I have multiple Rain Machine devices I want to control, and makes me select my single device from a single-element list every time I open it. None of this affects functionality, but it doesn't exactly reflect well on the quality of work that went into designing the app.";"2017-04-05T23:46:58-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=647589286&type=Purple%20Software";"647589286";268;"en";"NEGATIVE"

Western NC was suffering severe drought in October. I arrived at my Lake home in early November hoping to find my Rain Machine controller functioning, only to find it with the screen frozen and no matter how I attempted to reboot it, it came back to the same frozen screen. All my landscape was severely parched and the one time I really counted on Rain Machine to perform, it failed. It's now in the garbage can, I purchased a Rachio. 

Update: Apr 2016:  I like the addition of historical and projected watering data. However, the whole reason I bought this device was to monitor watering at my vacation home remotely.  Sporadically, I still get a ""Sprinkler does not respond"" message. I have other apps that I use for home monitoring, etc and I can reliably access all of them so I know the problem is not with my local internet service. The problem lies somewhere in how the Rain Machine app was written. I have been putting up with this remote access problem for 3 years...still no resolution. Frustrating. 

2014:  So excited for update, but no improvement. I get very slow response. Most of the time I get a request timed out message. I also don't see where you can remotely update the software on the Rain Machine itself. I was hoping this version would allow me to see historical info about when the Rain Machine actually watered each zone and for how many minutes.

Do not buy an app-dependent product for your home — if the app is crap it wastes hundred of hours of your time. We should not have to spend hours on their forums just to water the lawn! iOS app does not function like the Android app — took hours of frustration and careful screenshoting to find out that the “next scheduled day” field would revert back to something else on my iPhone app. You cannot make the sprinklers run tomorrow and then continue the schedule after that. The device is OK, probably fine as a non-internet connected dumb touchscreen scheduler. That way you can also keep it from spying on you and monetizing your info. Just give it a remote! Also, relying on the app to use the internet weather and adaptive watering is folly. It kept skipping watering for the whole week because we got a tenth of an inch of rain (probably on the other side of town.) Not transparent or predictable. App does not have good data for dry climates, xeriscape, or heavy clay soil. Slowly I have been backing off from relying on this product. Now I set manual schedules, plastic rain gauges, etc. Often I just leave it off and press the button to water when it’s appropriate. So… it’s still great to be able to use my phone to turn the zones on and off while I’m setting up the sprinklers.

When you select any of the first 3 sprinkler head types (rotors low rate, pop-up spray, or rotors high rate) it actually shows one of the other types in the menu.  I have no idea what is actually selected.  I found this within 5 minutes of installing the device and the app.  Developer should have found it immediately as well.  It’s obvious that the code wasn’t tested.

Now it deleted all of the zone images I just spent time putting in.  Very buggy.

Afraid to update it now as it has been so buggy and it’s working at the moment.  Also  to whoever is writing the notes on the latest fix, it’s “losing” when something is lost, not “loosing” which is what you do with an arrow and a bow! :)";"2020-08-16T09:43:35-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=647589286&type=Purple%20Software";"647589286";155;"en";"NEGATIVE"
