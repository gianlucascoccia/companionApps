Update haven‚Äôt any changes on user interface and not add any additional information providing to us. It will be good to explain some instead of still improving............etc. Nothing changed for few years.
Please add more translations (Czech). Slovak, EU countries, external temperature in termostat graf from netatno output senzor.

There is no geofencing option. 
Dated UI. As in the actual thermostat the display features the set point in bold above the actual temperature in outline. 
Can‚Äôt delete schedules as the delete button is greyed out so I now have 7 different schedules all with different times that do not correspond to the times and temperatures that I‚Äôve set. 
Everything about this app is half baked and/or backwards. Seriously considering returning the entire system.";"2020-10-22T11:26:10-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=730893725&type=Purple%20Software";"730893725";107;"en";"NEGATIVE"
