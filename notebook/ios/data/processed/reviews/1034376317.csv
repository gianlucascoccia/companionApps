Maybe the first reviewer had legitimate issues, but I’ve had absolutely none. The alarm was simple to install; three adapters included, one for wire-to-wire installation, plus two other modular plugs for compatibility with other brands. I just opened the breaker for my smoke detector, matched the wire colors and attached with the existing wire nuts. The white and black wires come pre-stripped, but if you want to use the orange interconnect, it will have to be cut and stripped. 
Once everything was hooked up, shut the breaker and everything powered up fine. Downloaded the app and paired it to the detector. Linked up with HomeKit on my phone without even trying!
Now I don’t currently have a HomeKit hub at home, so I can’t say whether there are any issues there. 
As far as interconnect goes, mine is connected to three basic First Alert wired models in other areas of the house (model 9120B), and when I tested the OneLink model, they all went off. You should have seen my cats!

The App DOES NOT tell you right away there is a problem; in fact it says everything is fine. After a while, it may tell you... and offer to silence the alarm but in my experience that feature has always failed.

There’s no trouble shooting support in the app.  If any step fails you have to start the whole process over from the first step.  It’s particularly annoying that mounting the detector is included in the setup process, so you have to page through those steps every time you have to retry the setup.

3.) when I “Reset Networking” on my iOS device, it requires I re-pair with my first alert devices? Why? (Re question #2)

In general, it seems this app was built and conceived poorly as several other Homekit device makers who utilize WiFi in the implementation of their homekit devices don’t seem to have any of these issues (ConnectSense, Elgato Eve, iDevices, etc).

I bought these so I’d be informed if there were a CO leak or fire and I wasn’t home. So much for that, a total waste of money.

And after each shower I have to run around the house and silence each alarm since they’re all connected.";"2019-02-05T08:40:01-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1034376317&type=Purple%20Software";"1034376317";134;"en";"NEGATIVE"

The Protect's hardware is much nicer in features, user experience and build quality, but it is now owned by Google. Nest’s night light has motion sensor, Onelink’s night light does not.

OneLink’s app is terrible. The app has earned the 1.5 App Store rating. Each alarm  took several setup attempts. On average I spent over 45 minutes setting up each alarm in the app. That does not include the hardware installation, which was simple. For the price, I expect better.

There were many, many timeouts ""accessing device data"", setting up wifi, etc. The app would often tell me something went wrong, with a button to finish setup. This never, ever worked. It would spin for minutes at a time. I have a video over 14 minutes long of trying to set up the last one, and that was only half the attempts.

It feels like whomever wrote this software is a contractor. They got paid and are out. Surely there is no way this was written by an in-house team, because if so, they should be asked to set up the current hardware on a vaulted ceiling with this app on a hot day.

The Onelink PHONE support has been good. I had an issue with one alarm that chirped every minute and said the battery was low. The FAQ said to replace the battery but it was brand new, so I called. The person told me that the alarm had to ""click"" into the mounting plate as there is some  pressure sensor. I reapplied the alarm to the plate and it seemed to fix it, although I also reconnected the adapter. It was nice to get support on a Saturday.

I am able to ask my HomePod ""is there smoke upstairs?"" or ""Is there smoke in the vanity room?"" and Siri responds pretty quickly that no, there is no smoke indicated. So that's a good sign.

But the setup is simply unacceptable and I cannot recommend this product until First Alert completely overhauls their app. If the hardware is the issue, then the hardware needs updating. But app just spins and spins for multiple minutes with no feedback and then just says an error occurred. It's infuriating compared to how easy the Nest Protects were to set up, and that was seven years ago.  There is no excuse for this poor level of software performance.

I have not had an alarm trigger, as I just installed them so I have no idea how well they function as a smoke detector.

Lastly, First Alert needs a light on their hardwired unit that indicates power is on. The night light only works if the night light has been enabled, which it is not while setting up the unit. Knowing that the writing is correct before beginning setup is important.";"2020-08-23T11:55:14-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1034376317&type=Purple%20Software";"1034376317";479;"en";"NEGATIVE"

The biggest takeaway you should get from this is that FirstAlert is a fine company but launched a product they're incapable of supporting. They jumped on the bandwagon to sell a device but didn't think about the resources needed to maintain it.

Configuration:
- AirPort Extreme (4th gen)
- iPad Air
- iPhone 6s
- Apple TV (4th gen)
- Multiple existing HomeKit products (Philips, Elgato)

Multiple failed attempts, went so far as to separate 2.4GHz and 5GHz network SSIDs (OneLink only supports 2.4GHz). Customer support is shipping me a replacement device stating the device must be defective (I'm skeptical). 

Like a previous poster, I'm a software engineer, I've provided support my configuration, I've reset my iPhone Network settings as well as my network multiple times, trying varying configurations, all my other HomeKit devices remain unaffected and functional, but I can't seem to even pair the device. 

I've followed the ""in-app"" setup, I've even gone so far as to set the device in pairing mode and manually configure it through the Settings -> Wifi app (the device appears here while in pairing mode).

If First Alert doesn’t   know how to code in options for FaceID and TouchID options maybe they can ask Apple for assistance.";"2019-01-23T21:35:05-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1034376317&type=Purple%20Software";"1034376317";99;"en";"NEGATIVE"

While I did figure out it’s 2.4 only and that was 90% of the user woes, I use Cisco WLC at home and setup a separate 2.4 only SSID with no fast roam options and this made it work reliably for two months, today their crappy customer service and software caught up with me.

Updated app, new terms of service hit accept password doesn’t work. Tried reset net with amazon error 32 no such account. I have a cool personal email so it never changes so no other possibilities. I search my account for the original Onelink accept email confirming the correct message. So this is a back end Onelink server issue.

No email, no text, no blog support group even a reply to the original acceptance email is met with deny message. They obviously don’t want to communicate with customers check their site for contract us, it doesn’t exist.

I’m sure I can create a new account and re program the unit but how long until the backend gets updated again and repeat.

I have a complex HomeKit network with a lot of different vendors hardware and have high expectations on how a HomeKit product should work.

I installed two Onelink Environmental Monitors on two different Apple wireless networks with no issues. Fully integrated into homekit with no issues on first attempt and everything worked as expected including remote access via AppleTV 4.

Some things previously complained about are now addressed such as HomeKit code now on power adapter as well as manual. 

I cannot speak for others experience but thus far  my experience is positive and inline with my expectations. 

This is not to say the app is perfect. The app on occasion shows a “setup” icon next to each unit instead of temp/humidity/co for some reason. Tapping the setup causes the unit icon to refresh and apox 2 seconds later the units values showup. 

In reality once the unit is setup i have found no real reason to use first alerts application. I either use apple’s home app or elgatos application to manage the unit.

Features id like to see in the future application

1. Ability to change wifi network within app
2. Ability to see full mac address within application";"2018-05-05T13:50:05-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1034376317&type=Purple%20Software";"1034376317";211;"en";"POSITIVE"

Consumer Reports recommends replacing smoke detectors every 10 years as the smoke sensor becomes less effective or may not function at all, even though the alarm still works and the unit tests fine. So i did my homework via the Internet, then called first alert and spoke with a product specialist. The specialist and I together designed a Home smart system that met my specifications.  1) units that Easily interchanged with my existing hardwired connectors. 2) Voice information from the detectors along with the alarm, so the system will tell me which unit has detected the danger. 3) 10 year sealed lithium battery backup, so I never need to change batteries during the life of the unit. 4) units that detect both smoke and carbon monoxide dangers. 5) when one unit sounds an alarm...they all go off, so if the fire is detected in an area where I don’t hear the alarm, I won’t have to wait for smoke to make it to the detectors closest to me before they go off as well. (I have a 3rd wire that connects my units but I was told they can interface with one another over your home’s wi-fi) 6) the units are smart so they interact with my phone via the Onelink App, so if I’m not at home, I am notified of a detection remotely.  I have pets and this type of notification was a must have for me. I did have a hard time locating AC10-500 hardwired units to purchase. It seemed to me the DC10-500 battery only units were readily available at most retail locations. The battery only units do not need to be hardwired, but it is my understanding that life expectancy depends on number of alerts over the life of the unit, because they’re relying on power from the sealed 10 year battery only. Once I did find the hardwired units to purchase. I easily installed them by myself. The package contained various connector adapters, one of which are used to connect a new unit. Step 1) download the First Alert Onelink app to the device you want to use to set up your system. If your device is connected to iCloud make sure your Keychain is turned ON before proceeding. Step 2) make sure both your Wi-Fi and your Bluetooth turned on. The units use Bluetooth to set up & configure your device and wi-fi for notifications to your device later. Step 3) there is a number and a QR code on the side of the smoke detector make note of that number you will need it to Bluetooth pair the detector with your device. Step 4) twist your old unit to the left and pull it down. Remove the connector by pulling it straight out of the back of the smoke detector. Loosen the screws on the mounting bracket (do not remove them). now you can twist the mounting bracket to the screw slot, pull down and remove the mounting bracket. Step 5) Now turn on your app and login. Step 6) slide on your new mounting bracket over the loose and screws and tighten them down once you have the bracket in a position you like. You may need to use one of the adapters provided to connect between your existing hardwire and the new unit. Plug into the unit on the back making sure the connectors have snapped into place securely. As soon as you connected the unit will come to life and start speaking to you. At this point you will need to enter the unit number to Bluetooth pair OR if you’re close enough to the detector you can scan the QR code with the app on your phone. You will now notice that the unit automatically pairs with your app. Follow the directions on your app at this point remembering to remain as close to the unit as possible. Mostly you just need to hit the next button on the app. There is one screen will you will need to give a name to the unit. This is the name Siri will use when speaking to you during alarms. Once the units are set up you can go back in through the Onelink app later and reconfigure the alarms to customize as needed as long as you are within Bluetooth range of that unit.  I hope my experience is helpful to you. I love my new detectors. By the way they work with HomeKit, Alexa, and Google assistant, but I don’t have any of those just used my iPhone and kept it simple.  Works perfectly!! There is a new very smart Onelink detector, model 1039102, that is an Alexa, a smoke detector, a music speaker and a carbon monoxide detector all rolled into one that is also available for purchase at $250 that will work with these units I just installed. Maybe down the line I will add one or two.";"2018-02-11T08:08:54-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1034376317&type=Purple%20Software";"1034376317";837;"en";"POSITIVE"
