Had trouble with set up, once that was worked out with much anguish, and i thought it worked, i left and it would not turn anything on or off and there was no way to correct problems remotely. You must be on same network to do anything. Switched them out for Ediplugs. Still trying to utilize these (4) plugs for more than paperweights at my local location and the still wont connect to my network. Look for another product, i wasted my money on these 'dumb plugs'";"2016-09-05T17:44:18-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=914407548&type=Purple%20Software";"914407548";98;"en";"NEGATIVE"
