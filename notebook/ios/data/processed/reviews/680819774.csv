The Nest app had a flow of devices with relevant content. For each thermostat, it showed the settings and current temp. I only had to click through to the device of I wanted to make changes. In Google, I have to select the category thermostats and then an individual device before I see any information. That's two additional clicks pet device instead of just being able to see it all at once. In Nest, I could invite anyone to join the home by entering their email address. It would send them an email invite with a link that would walk them through setting up their account. In Google, it simple tells me I can only add people with a Google account. I have to tell them to go setup an account on their own and then add them later. That is not a friendly experience. I can only see one camera at a time. In Nest, I could see them on a single page and then choose one to get a full page view. And finally, the color scheme is much more stark and less pleasing.

Most of the negative is with the video history and the lack of options to delete. If you look at something that was detected, there’s no way to delete that particular video from the screen where you watch it. The ONLY way to delete videos at this time is to delete all of them at one time, you cannot delete single videos. With Ring, and I have an app version that’s working fairly well and you can at least select which ones to delete. Also with Ring you could get a preview upon opening the app. With the new Nest doorbell, it just says the camera is “Idle” and you have to go to live view to see what is currently happening. So, Nest doorbell developers, this system needs some work. Also, the doorbell has a built in battery, so what happens in about 2-3 years when the battery gives out, can the battery be replaced or would I need to buy a new $180 doorbell ???
UPDATE 9/2/21:  Returning the Nest doorbell battery.  Tech support is worthless, the interaction with Google Home is terrible. and the lack of a replaceable battery just caps it off.

Even though my Apple devices can readily find and pair with this hardware via BT and WiFi, the Google Home App consistently has trouble finding and pairing.  There is no useful error message; Google Home simply displays an irritating graphic of falling shapes and suggests to “try resetting”.  Useless!

Further, Google Home has very limited controls.  I can select devices and turn them on and off.  That’s it.  To cast, I must do this from individual apps.  There is no reasonable way to use Google Home to adjust settings on the devices or help them to work together. Yes, I created “Rooms” and “Groups”, but these structures do not enable the most basic of features such as syncing audio/video from Google Chromecast across multiple devices (TVs, Speakers).  And heaven forbid I want to Cast something from Chromecast directly to the Nest speaker while doing something independently with my phone: the Google Home app prevents this from happening by stopping the active cast from the Chrome device.

The almost psychotic, scatterbrained placement of functions (some preferences are in one place, others in a totally different, unrelated place) is maddening. At least start making your hardware compatible with HomeKit or even Geeni for god’s sake so the user experience isn’t destroyed by this app. Seriously, Geeni is a better smart home manager app… this scattershot, unintuitive interface is why I traded in my Galaxy for an iPhone and have never looked back, and this only serves to remind me why.";"2021-11-30T00:14:29-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=680819774&type=Purple%20Software";"680819774";173;"en";"POSITIVE"

We just bought a 2nd generation indoor Nest cam but didn’t realize we cannot use the Nest app with it; it only works with Google Home. This is dumb, since it’s labeled as a Nest product. 

One big issue for us is that you cannot mute the audio from the cameras in the app, even when your phone is muted. This is a problem because we use it as a crib monitor next to our bed, and if the baby is fussing and we’re monitoring from bed, he’ll hear it and probably fuss more. This will literally cause us to lose sleep, in other words. 

Also, the camera histories are not as reliable in Google Home. On our doorbell, for example, images of the same event are viewable in the Nest app but Google Home says they’re not retrievable. Navigating to the camera histories is not as intuitive in Google Home and requires more clicks than in Nest.  

A similar but less significant issue is the format of the app. Nest has images/icons that are more informative and easier to quickly navigate than what is in Google Home. 

I was initially happy with Nest, but I’ve been increasingly dissatisfied since they were purchased by Google. The changes they’ve implemented suggest their primary goal is to collect data on my family and home, and the user experience has become secondary.

Summary 
It has many great features but they don’t work effectively. We have the Google Home app managing our Google Nest mesh Wi-Fi network. We have had several problems with the app effectively managing the Wi-Fi. 

Setup Interface
This is the one area that was well crafted. The user experience and ease of setup was great.  All our mesh network was connected within less than 15 min. 

Managing WIFI 
We created a family group which you can pause for our children and set schedules. It won’t unpause their group even though it says it is not paused.  It constantly kicks users off of the wifi and then locks you out even though you have the correct password you can’t reconnect. I’ve even had the app open copied the password from the app and pasted it and still said wrong password. 

Troubleshooting 
The FAQs and help don’t provide the answers we need. We even had a friend who manages wifi networks for a living try and help us. We expected more from Google. Sorry Google but we are just being honest.  

What’s next 
If we can’t get this fixed we will be returning the Nest Wifi and going with a different mesh network. We would be happy to talk to someone who can remedy this issue and help prevent these problems for other families.";"2020-09-23T05:28:45-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=680819774&type=Purple%20Software";"680819774";251;"en";"POSITIVE"

I just upgraded my Google WiFi points to Nest WiFi points, and the experience was unbelievably awful. It took me over two hours to get two brand new points connected by trying the craziest combos of network resets, power cycles, app force closes, manually changing WiFi networks, etc, to get them to work. Their phone support was experiencing difficulties during regular business hours, so I had to figure it out myself. 

The Nest experience was always so easy and seamless. This Google Home experience is the exact opposite, and I can’t recommend it to my non-techy family/friends/co-workers. And that’s a shame, because the products are great once they’re set up. 

*Original Post:

I purchased a Nest Home Hub to replace my old Echo Show. I placed it in my kitchen, where I have two other Google Home speakers/devices. After googling/testing multiple solutions, I cannot figure out how to get all three speakers to play music via a voice command. I’ve tried to rename devices, groups, and rooms. In the end, the Hub chooses to play on “Kitchen Left.” I can add the other speakers through the hub, but not the app. 

When I go to the media tab in the app, while playing music on all speakers, it crashes. 

At this point, I’m thinking about ditching all of my Google Home devices (except Nest cams) and go all with Echos. It pains me to say this, because I’m a huge Google fan. This app and their devices are just not where they need to be unfortunately.";"2020-10-12T19:30:31-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=680819774&type=Purple%20Software";"680819774";257;"en";"POSITIVE"

Then I ordered two of the newer wireless battery outdoor cams which I wired power wise for full time recording.  Found out my familiar app no longer can be used and need Google Home.  Honestly - the premise is there but the devices don’t like it.  Constantly having to retry connections to get live, if you switch away from the app - you come back to it frozen.  If you click a notification of someone or something on cam, you get to app and it says “video not available yet”.  If you left the app open on a historic event - and switch to another app, you come back to it stuck on the camera event and you can’t click out.  App becomes unresponsive.

Running on a iPhone 13 pro Max with latest OS and I’m almost regretting buying these cameras because of how bad my reliability is with them. 

Also wifi AP to both cameras is within 10’ of each inside the home and wifi signal is great.

This means I can’t use my phone to control the volume or skip songs or anything. Very annoying. When it does work, it takes a while for it to “see” that it is connected and then longer to show you the device control screen, so if you want to quickly lower the volume, you have to race over to the google mini and hit the button or yell at the thing, “hey google, lower!” The benefit of hitting the button or using the app (if it’s working) is that you don’t miss any of the song. When you say “hey google,” it keeps playing the song even though you can’t hear it, so you miss like 10 seconds of it, which I dislike. When you can use the app, it’s just like a volume knob, so the song plays continuously.

But it’s a disaster.

1. Chromecasting is hit-or-miss.  Often times I have to disconnect and reconnect from my speakers more than once to get them to actually play.

2. Saying ‘ok Google play <whatever artist> on the living room speaker” Always plays it on the living room TV even though I’ve renamed the living room TV to ‘big TV’ to remove any possible confusion and my living room speaker (Vizio sound bar) is named ‘living room speaker’.  I want to listen to music, not have a bright 75” screen on just to show album art from Google Play.

3. If I chromecast music from Google Play Music on my iPhone (because the Google Home Mini is too stupid to do it, see #2 above), and then I ask the Google Home Mini to stop the music playing on the living room speaker, the mini tells me nothing is playing on the living room speaker.

4. Even though Siri and Alexa recognize commands like ‘turn off the downstairs lights’, Google Home Mini tells me “I’m sorry I don’t know how to do that” so I have to tell it room by room which lights to turn off.

Google Home is by far the dumbest of the three home voice assistants for media and home automation and this app is the weakest of the bunch.";"2018-02-25T21:12:27-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=680819774&type=Purple%20Software";"680819774";254;"en";"NEGATIVE"

Google home is great for controlling phillip hue lights. In fact, it’s the smart home device that I use most consistently. However, there are glitches in the support regarding when I refer to a specific room or light. For example, Google home sometimes does not register “light 6” aka our “bathroom light” when I give the command to turn it on, sometimes multiple times. Other times google home only works if I phrase it as “turn light 6 on” while other times it only takes “turns bathroom on.”This can lead to a shouting battle between me and the google home. Lol

Besides that error, the improvement suggestion I have is to have the “keep only (light/room name here) on” command, which should only keep the light/light group mentioned on and turn all other lights off. This would be very convenient as I currently have to give four to five commands every time in order get only the room that I want to be on while turning the rest off. 

As a long-time customer and user, I am hoping that google will make these changes to improve this product.

I know if it’s 68° outside that I can change my thermostat from 72° to 68° and not feel as if I’m going to be charged a heck of a lot of money from the power company.

For someone who likes to really personalize audio, the eq setting should be quite a bit more advanced. I should also be able to play audio on multiple devices at a time. 

Love the app and love the product itself, but it’s not quite there.

Once set up, everything works as advertised. I have schedules set up for my child’s screen time to turn off various devices at different times. Here is what I run into several times a week:
- I can’t delay a schedule just once. When I delay it thirty minutes, that becomes the new start time going forward until I disable and re enable the schedule
- when I disable the schedule, then select it again the re enable it, the “scheduled disabling” notification covers the Enable button. I have to wait a couple of seconds until it disappears before I can enable it again
- I can’t override a skipped schedule. The workaround is to disable and re enable it. See previous point

None of these would be too bad if as I said, I didn’t run into them so often. 

On my wish list would be integration with Alexa so I can manage these schedule exceptions without my phone.

Why is it mute? This really annoys me because this was one of the main reasons I bought the google home was because I thought it would have this ability.

For example, it asks you if it’s ok to record you AT ALL TIMES in order to “recognize your voice better”. If this doesn’t sound shady enough, google blocks basic essentials irrelevant to voice recording in order for you to have to let them listen to you all day. It also asks for your address and current location at all times for “weather”, but you only really need what city you live in and google home shouldn’t leave your house. It’s all just one big scam so google can force you to let them know everything about you so they can sell all your personal info to advertisers.

2) Chromecast would not show up in the app. All troubleshooting articles for Chromecast have no help for 1st gen Chromecast.

This was never once suggested in the troubleshooting section or during setup.

So that’s what’s wrong with the app currently. Yes you can set up your devices but if you come across a problem, be prepared to either figure it out yourself or seek outside information.

If you are not technical or had some experience with networking, computer issues or the like, then you will be frustrated if wanting to connect and use more than one Google Home, Mini, Max.

I have a Google Home, Google Home Max, 2 Mini’s.  If they would just display in the app I would be fine, but the devices have a very weak connectivity to the network.  I can sit 30’ away from some of the devices and they will not display in the app, but the other’s will.  If I move closer to the Router and devices, then they show up in the app but then I lose the others.

I’ve probably worn out the devices since I have rebooted them so many times.  There is a strong learning curve and typically the longer you struggle the more you learn increasing the number of times you factory reset all devices and start over.

Even so, the App is flawed.  Maybe someday Google will get their act together.";"2018-06-16T14:14:18-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=680819774&type=Purple%20Software";"680819774";197;"en";"NEGATIVE"

First this was a forced app switch.  That wouldn’t have been so bad if the usability of the app was at least as good as the version it replaced.  Sadly that is not the case.  Even a cursory run through of the app would reveal gaping usability issues.

My wife and I are both on G-Suite accounts.  The Home app downright refuses to let you share the home with a second user if they’re on a G-Suite account.  You get some random error that isn’t even explained.

To use a shared account, I would have to completely reset my Google WiFi and bind it to a regular Gmail account (and share with another Gmail for my wife). That means 120+ devices would have to be setup and named again, family schedules would have to be redefined, and would be in itself a weekend project, since Google lacks backup and restore function for WiFi. 

Coupled with that lack of functionality, the Home App is missing many pieces of functionality from the Google WiFi app.

Your doorbell integration with a Google Home Mini never worked, so I went out and bought myself a $20 standard doorbell and re-wired everything. 

And worst, there’s no consistency with Nest Protect. Are you serious? That’s one of the biggest reasons I trusted Nest! They just don’t show up, and all the room settings are different.

It will show all of my devices as unpaused, and if I try to pause one nothing happens on the screen. But if I switch to the WiFi app it shows that the device is actually paused and will let me unpause it. Trying to unpause from the Home app does nothing. If Google is going to force us to use this app then they need to fix this part of it or else I’ll be switching to a different router.";"2021-05-06T08:37:12-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=680819774&type=Purple%20Software";"680819774";106;"en";"POSITIVE"

It always disconnects which leaves me having to always turn on the switch anyways.

I can’t even get it to re connect properly I’ve been sitting here troubleshooting the lights C by GE with a Google Home Mini for over 3 hours and nothing seems to be working. I’ve factory reset the bulbs several times. Disconnected my google home and re connected. I’ve “forgot devices” and started from scratch and now nothing will connect. I’ve restarted my router and modem for troubleshooting this error and that didn’t work. I’ve hard stopped the application on my device and that didn’t work.
