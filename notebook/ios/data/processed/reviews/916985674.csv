I did have an issue with the first remote sensor, but after contacting support, they sent me an additional one and it works flawlessly. I relocated the original sensor to a room adjacent to the thermostat and it now works as expected also. I have had times where I could not connect with my thermostat via the iPhone app, but I could not connect with other apps at my home at that same time, indicating that my very poor internet connection was temporarily down. I can find no fault with the ecobee app, and I have found their support to be extremely good. They talked me through an issue that was similar to the ‚Äúlearning‚Äù that a competing product performed that I did not want. I would certainly recommend this product, and would definitely buy another if I ever need a new thermostat! However, it seems unlikely that I will need a new one as this one does everything I want it to and more. Additionally, I find this product much more cosmetically pleasing on the wall than other similar products.

You can get lost easily in menus and have difficulty remembering where they place each function. The app has been built up over time and could use some spring cleaning and reorganizing. I will also admit that the most recent app update removed all the iconic bee interfaces and replaced them with boring ‚Äòe‚Äô symbols. It definitely shows the device is going mainstream and is killing its unique brand history in the process. That aside beware of the in-app subscription service. They now offer filters direct however, and this is a big however, the filters contain no labeling and I can tell you from first hand experience they do not appear to met the MERV ratings you are paying for. I ordered MERV 13 and based on appearance alone, it‚Äôs a MERV 7 fabric at best. I advised Ecobee of this and they didn‚Äôt even apologize or offer to fix it.

The latter isn‚Äôt so much of an issue in my case, as I primarily rely on the ecobee app‚Ä¶when the thermostat isn‚Äôt unexpectedly offline, which is my primary problem.

A quick search will reveal a history of WiFi issues with ecobee thermostats. Perhaps they‚Äôve been addressed in the most recent models; I can only speak to my personal experience. In short, my thermostat goes offline often, and at unpredictable times, for periods of one or two hours or more. At various times over the years I‚Äôve done the troubleshooting set out in ecobee‚Äôs materials, and I‚Äôve followed online tips and suggestions from others experiencing similar issues. Sometimes it appears that the unit is off the local WiFi network, while at others it behaves as though it‚Äôs connected but can‚Äôt reach ecobee‚Äôs servers. Other devices on the WiFi network remain happy and connected. I‚Äôm done going down the rabbit hole.

Given that continuing, unresolved issue, I‚Äôm disappointed in the level of ‚Äúflakiness‚Äù with the unit‚Äôs WiFi connectivity and can‚Äôt recommend ecobee to others.

But there is one long-standing issue that I find is very user-unfriendly.  Just about every day, various room sensors will become ‚Äúnot detected‚Äù by the thermostat (which prompts an email alert).  Usually within a few minutes, or maybe an hour or so, the sensor will be detected again, which causes another email alert.

This is annoying, but is nothing compared to the hassle that greets me the next time I happen to open the app to make a temperature change... a series of alerts will pop up, a new one appearing each time I dismiss one, until all of the ‚Äúbuilt-up‚Äù alerts since the last time I used the app have been displayed, turning a quick temperature adjustment into a much longer ordeal.

This could VERY easily be solved with an option in the settings to control how long a sensor has to be undetected before an alert is generated.  Yes, if a room sensor is undetected for 24 hours, I want to know about it.  But i don‚Äôt need to receive an alert every time the thermostat doesn‚Äôt hear from the sensor right when expected... let us select how much ‚Äúundetected‚Äù time must pass before we get an alert, as it will probably reconnect within an hour (or less).";"2020-05-09T06:35:52-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=916985674&type=Purple%20Software";"916985674";222;"en";"POSITIVE"

Humidity readings seem accurate but the thermostat won‚Äôt address it when humidity controls are used (I.e. when the humidity is high the system doesn‚Äôt work to get it under control). Additionally, there‚Äôs a significant lag in communication between the thermostat, secondary ecobee device and the app. You will see different readings between all 3. Temperatures are always off by 1-3 degrees from reality leading to rooms getting stuffy and or too cold. 

Lately the app is taking longer to load and will show a different temp and or humidity level two or three times in less than a few seconds. The slider control is very fickle for changing temps and when you change your setting, the room temp reading changes by 1-2 degrees from what it just loaded which doesn‚Äôt make sense. For example, I open the app it says 73 degrees, I change the setting to 70 from 72 and then the app will say the temp is 74.

However, with a recent update, they made it much more difficult to use the temperature vertical ‚Äúslider‚Äù to say change the temperature up or down a few degrees. 
It‚Äôs now much harder/impossible to see, as you‚Äôre sliding the temperature and guessing what it‚Äôs at, where you‚Äôre at until you release your finger. You then have to see what it randomly ended on, then randomly guess how much to slide up or down to go up or down the desired number of degrees. This usually takes like 10 tries to get it right and results in a lot of random temps being sent to you ecobee before you get the right change. It should show AS YOU‚ÄôRE SLIDING what temp you‚Äôre at so you know how much to adjust or when to release.

It seems to only be broken on the main front page of the app - if you click the temp it goes to another similar page that still works at least a bit better (this is why i gave 2 instead of 1 stars).

Just a tip Ecobee, iPhones have great security features such as Face And Touch ID.

I‚Äôve updated this review over the last few weeks a few times as I went from a huge fan to being very upset due to their rollout of eco+ and now back to neutral.  Eco+ as originally rolled out required you to accept terms and conditions that gave them the ability to enroll you in power company programs that allow your thermostat to be remotely controlled.  They‚Äôve subsequently changed it so you can decline them and not receive the functionality.  It‚Äôs hard to know if this was just a poorly rolled out feature or if they did it to drive revenue as I would assume they‚Äôd be paid some type of fee for enrolling customers.  

In either case, I hope they are much more cautious going forward.  Also, I hope that the eco+ function has an ‚Äòoff‚Äô setting, not just a minimum.  Lastly, unclear if it‚Äôs just my situation but the Alexa functionality that has worked like a dream the last year is suddenly hinkey. Maybe it‚Äôs just a coincidence.   

I really hope this company errs on the side of their customer and transparency.

Yet another ‚Äúupdate ‚Äú and the functionality of the app has gone down again. Previously the app replicated the interface of the main unit which was intuitive and functional. Now it barely allows monitoring of a portion of the systems abilities. I am seriously considering switching to nest or something similar to improve the app experience   Very disappointed with the direction the company is taking this app.

Additionally after 4 years there is still no option to manually trigger a data call from a remote sensor. There is still no time stamp or ability to update the information provided by the remote sensors.  So when it says a room is occupied or not you have no idea for how long nor the ability to override the sensors determination.

The most disappointing thing is that it at least mirrored the main device until recently. So at a minimum you could interact with the app the same way you would with the thermostat in the main room. Now that functionality is gone.

I totally agree that this app is less and less useful with each update. I truly do not understand what the direction the developers are trying to move towards.

The bad news is I have now owned two different models of the thermostat for over 3 years. I upgraded to the latest and greatest last year thinking it would fix the Alexa problems.

It did not fix it!

So the ongoing nightmare is that #1. Alexa auto adjusts its own volume, even if auto adjust is turned off. #2. I have yet to go a full 4-8 hours without experiencing Alexa voice command issues where she says ‚ÄúI am experiencing trouble please contact customer service if this issue continues.‚Äù I have lived with this nightmare of non responsive Alexa not knowing any better. Recently I visited a friend who uses the echo dot and it works FLAWLESSLY! 

I bought the ecobee with Alexa because I wanted an integrated Alexa control that could seamlessly integrate into my home via an existing appliance. I didn‚Äôt want an extra machine cluttering up my house and taking up precious outlets and counter space. However i would never recommend the ecobee to anyone if this were being purchased for the Alexa integration.

The worst part is that ecobee has no control over fixing these issues and consumers have to reach out to the Alexa customer service who have very little understanding of the ecobee products and I have yet to have any of my issues resolved by them.";"2020-12-17T11:30:00-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=916985674&type=Purple%20Software";"916985674";243;"en";"POSITIVE"

First of all, I had to upgrade my phone to iOS 12 just to be able to talk to my thermostat, which is not mentioned as a requirement in the App Store. Nor, is the app flagged as requiring iOS 12+.

Another issue I have is that the app defaults to a list view of managed thermostats, where I have to pick which thermostat I wish to control. I only have one thermostat, why do I have to pick? The previous versions would go directly to the interface of my one and only thermostat. 

The final issue is concerning alerts. Almost daily there is a high humidity alert on my thermostat. This occurs in the morning after everyone is done showering. This is normal for our home and household. This new version of the app doesn‚Äôt even show alerts or give any indication that there is an alert on the thermostat.

There is also no local access to your Ecobee if internet is down. There are better less-known thermostats that do this.

Finally, there‚Äôs no option for left handed operation. I can‚Äôt use the app proper even when it works well (which is rare). My finger blocks the temperature I‚Äôm trying to set.

Thumbs down. I have only tried Radio Thermostat, which I recommend over this, specifically due to the app‚Äôs shortcomings.

Got a response saying they will pass it on to the team. Who is the team? Some development group in another country? I simply want to be able to use my two thermostats as if I bought the other brand instead. Bad investment.

Also, it really is unbelievable that this app makes me sign in once every 3-4 days during the middle of the night when I‚Äôm trying to sleep. Who in their right mind should be forced to type in their complex password with one eye open when they woke at 2a and simply wanted to turn on the AC?

So....my suggestions are:

1) Change your architecture to support direct connections to the thermostat when on the same network (example: Pentair‚Äôs Intellicenter)
2) Fire the person responsible for your data center/cloud infrastructure.  Your servers go down way too often.

Am quite a savvy tech user but haven‚Äôt yet been able to to find:

1. A way to see my schedule and adjust the program. Granted have only tried for 30 minutes. However smart designers know that design needs to be INTUITIVE. (My standard: Should be able to figure it out in 2-3 minutes). Obviously your team does not know that.

2. How and where to get a user guide. Even this iPhone has one I can download. However, it is so intuitive that I have NEVER needed to look up anything. 

PLEASE USE THE iPHONE AS YOUR EXAMPLE!

What an awful experience after having spent $9000 on a new HVAC! 

Will give it a short while, then invest in a competitor such as NEST. 

Thank you.
