Absolutely horrible latency problems compared to the last version...your update has all but rendered this app useless...sitting around testing an update with your own constituency - is not a valid field test...

How horrible is this update?  I’m removing my thermostat - selling it on eBay getting something with something with a more reliable app...";"2019-09-01T03:56:20-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=937837126&type=Purple%20Software";"937837126";105;"en";"NEGATIVE"

I really don’t know if the developer receives the crush details and, if they do, why this is still an issue. As a developer myself, I know there’s no issues one cannot solve. It’s just a matter of priorities. I guess the company priority is just to sell you the thermostat that turns into a regular/dumb/old fashioned one as the smart features are not accessible due to the app malfunctions. When an average app rating is this low, it tells a lot about the company.";"2020-06-03T18:48:37-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=937837126&type=Purple%20Software";"937837126";105;"en";"NEGATIVE"
