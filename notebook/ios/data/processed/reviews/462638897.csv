I bought the Charge 3 and I hate taking it off. I love the notifications it sends if I haven‚Äôt moved from my desk each hour, I love the fact you can challenge other friends and colleagues to weekend, or weekly challenges as well as track your own performance. It‚Äôs got me more motivated than any exercise book, or personal trainer. The only downside I find is that it‚Äôs not 100% accurate. My resting heart rate on an ECG machine compared to my Fitbit has a difference of 10 beats per minute...that‚Äôs a big number when you‚Äôre trying to work in fat burn mode or/and cardio. In addition, when I train with other people my steps are pretty much the same but when we e all walked a 12km walk (as we‚Äôve done consistently this week), my Fitbit comes up with almost 2km less than the others! The only time it‚Äôs accurate is if I walk with my GPS on my phone and then sync the data after my walk/run. In addition the calorie counter has very limited good options and scanning them and sending them off is too time consuming. I find I‚Äôm using the ‚ÄúMy Fitnesspal‚Äù app to monitor my food intake...please look at their app and try and make the Fitbit calorie counter more user friendly. Apologies for mentioning the bits that need ‚Äútweaking‚Äù,  but it‚Äôs constructive feedback that I feel is important. All in all I am so chuffed that I have a Fitbit as its now become a way of life for me!

The categories are broken down to only a few, at most, and the search feature isn‚Äôt really all that reliable for what you‚Äôre truly trying to search for. For example, when searching for ‚Äúbeach‚Äù it only shows a few options, but IF you have a large amount of free time to search through the extensive library one by one, you happen to come across several more while browsing. Maybe having a ‚Äútag‚Äù feature for clock face developers to add search keywords would be nice. It would also be nice if there was a feature to filter clock faces by which ones are free from those that you have to buy.

I‚Äôm also not fond of the calorie link option that FitBit incorporates with the MyFitnessPal app. It would be nice for a setting to be provided to select whether you only want workout calories that you‚Äôve burned to automatically link to your MyFitnessPal app versus your overall calorie burn for the day. I‚Äôm one who only likes to log my calorie burn for workouts and not the entire day. 

Those are overall my only two complaints. For the most part, the FitBit app is great, with the exception of these couple of things, but I‚Äôve also only owned my Versa for less than a week, so I‚Äôm still exploring the app.";"2019-05-22T13:42:11-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=462638897&type=Purple%20Software";"462638897";253;"en";"POSITIVE"

The Inspire HR is buggy. Take minutes to manually sync, doesn‚Äôt aways catch that one hour nap and can register quiet TV watching as sleep. And my biggest daily frustration with this App is the sleep score. Sleep is one area Fitbit has been perfect in the past, now not so much. After 8 hours sleep and falling within the range of all the sleep parameters it gives a fair sleep score? So frustrating waking up feeling good and see fair for sleep score. I‚Äôve tried everything. This part of the sleep module is very demotivating. Since sleep is where, in the past, Fitbit has done better than anyone else. Past Fitbit models like Aria and it‚Äôs predecessors have been unbelievably accurate.

Update. Thanks for your response but my questions were not answered in the links you sent me. So I googled my questions where I easily found answers. Most people never get a sleep score higher than the high 70‚Äôs low 80‚Äôs. Then say that. Don‚Äôt have people trying everything to raise it. I‚Äôve had every smaller Fitbit. The Inspire HR is the most inaccurate for sleep and terrible at syncing. The internet is full of complaints. Fitbit has done more to hurt their image by telling users they are all sleep failures with the wildly controversial sleep score. Adjust it, do something. It makes your Fitbit look like a joke. You see the comments/complaints. Allow the user to turn it off. It‚Äôs a design failure.";"2020-05-12T07:11:14-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=462638897&type=Purple%20Software";"462638897";263;"en";"NEGATIVE"

Ironic timing since I actually managed to finally do some serious exercising every day this week. I think the tracker is still storing data since I‚Äôm still getting silent alarms and notifications when wearing it. I hope it‚Äôs storing everything til bugs are fixed. Please!

Update with 5 stars to go with it:  I was so surprised that the developers responded to the problem I posted about syncing, and for that alone, I‚Äôd give the app 5 stars for customer service. But better yet, the FitBit help page that they directed me to had the solution. It was at end of webpage after a long list of things to try, most of which everyone probably does. At the end of the ‚Äútry this‚Äù suggestions, the one about how to reset the actual tracker did the trick. I never knew there was a little button on the charger itself for this purpose. Anyways, my Flex 2 tracker miraculously synced after I reset it, and it had stored a full week of data, exercise, sleep patterns, etc, which appeared happily in the app.   The developer‚Äôs reply to my initial review has the link to follow for how-to.

I had been using different apps for diet and, although I was maintaining weight, I wasn't losing. In May 2014, I decided to put all my activity and diet into one program. I compared a few and ended up with the Fitbit program. By September 2014, I had lost 20 pounds. A miracle as far as I'm concerrned after so many years of trying. Most important, I feel healthier. I recently changed to the Fitbit One as a tool for my next goal....the next 10 pounds and to help me with my sleep cycle, which I have found to be amazing. The best thing out of all of this is that all the tools are together, complete with trends, journal, archives, and incentives. I have read some of the other reviews and find that one-dimensional observations of a multi-dimensional program lack the information and experience needed to be fair. If you buy a product knowing that it does not link with an app you are using, why buy it? Because the product, even as a stand alone, is good. In any program, the key is the user, whether the product integrates with an app or not. So, I have stated on the Facebook page that I am happy with the product and program and I reiterate that here.

One part I don‚Äôt like is the adventures area. So far it‚Äôs just places like Yosemite, NYC, Boston... Why? There are so many grand walks/hikes in so many areas of the world. There are also lots of other sites and apps that have countless walks/hikes mapped in whatever area you happen to be in but I‚Äôd much prefer to be able to access all of this from the Fitbit App. I‚Äôm stumped as to why Fitbit hasn‚Äôt extended the selection when it would be easy to load other walks and in turn be much more usable for everyone! It would also increase Fitbit usage and engagement. I remember thinking this when I first saw adventures on the front page of the app, clicked on it and saw just a few areas. Today I decided to check again and... 3-4 years later they still have the same few walks/hikes.

The watch and app won‚Äôt sync up to show the same stats, and the Charge 3 is always having issues syncing. Once a month since buying it in November I have to take the watch off my phone to re upload. Now I am trying to sync it to my phone again, and error codes non stop. The only solutions offered are to update the phone IOS or the watch app. Both of which are updated, and I don‚Äôt seem to have an option to do a manual update. Seeing all the forums of people with these issues that Fitbit has done nothing to help out with is a poor display from the company that I used to really love. People keep having problems and the company says nothing for months to a year, but they have time to send out an email saying they‚Äôve been bought by google ? Really disappointed in how this company seems to have gone downhill in quality of their customer service and how well their products work.

And of course, fitbit is known for tracking of activity and steps as well as heart rate. There is one complaint I have. I need a competitive atmosphere to enhance my healthy living. With the friends option you can challenge friends to like three different challenges. These challenges can easily get boring and unmotivated users if your friend runs track or something. I think it would be in fitbit and the health of the world‚Äôs intentions to have challenges dedicated to drinking enough water and reaching calorie goals and sleep goals as well. Activity is a big part of our health, however, when it comes to hydration, sleep, and nutrition many people are falling behind. With an increase in steps and activity. Fitbit should provide reminders to drink more water and to eat some food for more energy. I think that your healthy diet begins in the kitchen and ends with the right amount of steps. Without doing too much out of my way, I can usually achieve my step goal, but I often struggle with hydration and have fainting spells and sometimes get hospitalized due to lack of hydration. It is vital to a person‚Äôs well being to stay hydrated especially after working out or moving a lot.

It is true, you will add extra steps to get to a goal, and I don't consider myself a competitive person. I am sure the other elements of the Zip are great, but I am an online WW member, so I just use the FIT for upping my activity. 

I highly recommend this product. However I am adding a review of the Flex 2, (3 years later) which I hate. I lost my Fitbit zip and went with the Flex 2 when there was a long wait for  Zip delivery. I wish I hadn't. I give the Flex 0 stars. I have to download a new Fitbit app every time I try to sync the stupid thing. I've gone thru every help tip Fitbit offers, spent a long time on the phone with a person in customer support and have emailed the company for help. There has been no resolution. The company's support team used to be amazing, now they just read back text from the same help site I used when I tried to trouble shoot the problem. Also when the Flex 2 finally syncs (again after I download the app, again, for the third time that day) it seems to record arm movements.

More importantly, if you use the app to track meals you will regularly find yourself wanting to slam your head into the nearest wall. The search function is incredibly poor, returning baffling results for simple searches and not including an ability to search by restaurant or brand. If you cook a meal at home and have the package barcodes handy it‚Äôs easy enough, but god help you if you want to accurately record your meal if you eat at a restaurant or order out. It would be understandable if just local restaurants weren‚Äôt in the database but it‚Äôs just as hard to find your meal if you‚Äôre eating at a well recognized chain. Worst of all, certain foods and beverages have multiple entries for different portion sizes or for the same item sold at different restaurants or stores which crowds out the limited results when searching. For example, Coca Cola has different entries under many restaurants and retailers yet an ounce of the soda has the same nutrition information regardless of if you by a bottle at 7-11, order one with your meal at Applebee‚Äôs or get it at the McDonald‚Äôs drive through.

I started a challenge yesterday related to tracking active minutes ‚Äúin the zone‚Äù and it doesn‚Äôt seem to be connecting my active exercise minutes to this challenge so it shows that I‚Äôm making zero progress. I did give the app two stars because the adventures and virtual hikes are fun but the options are really limited.

Also FitBit DOES NOT have the capability to change the battery which means a $200 Versa watch (at the time) is JUNK! So our solution to the problem has been to purchase Apple watches. It is spot on and has ZERO glitches in the month we have owned them and we have done one update. Where Apple lacks is its ability to have sleep, diet, and caloric monitoring in one place. IE you have to have a separate app for these things so for example I use FatSecret, pillow and 8Fit for these items. So in comparison if you want something that works use Apple but if your looking for a program that works half the time but is all in one place Fitbit is your solution.

I am a RN and I am prone to fast heart rates. This really helps me track it through the day and monitor it while I work out. There is about a 3-4 second delay in the HR reading when my HR changes which seems reasonable as it has to monitor the change. It doesn‚Äôt do a great job when the HR gets really high- 170s + which is frustrating when I‚Äôm jogging on a treadmill. It is worse when running outside. 
The fitbit app used to INCLUDE the trends of your heart rate, included when you were sleeping. I updated the app awhile back, and now you HAVE TO PAY for a feature that was PREVIOUSLY INCLUDED. That is why I am giving this app such a low rating. If I had not updated I would still have had this feature, until the app FORCES you to update. This is total crap!! I‚Äôve had a fitbit for years and years. Next time I am purchasing a APPLE WATCH. How dare you charge for a feature that used to be included?!! What a crappy business move!!! You have lost my business!!! Oh, and I‚Äôm always eventually having problems with charging my device. Ugg!! I tell it to all day sync, but it never syncs until I open the app and manually do it.

The data collected by my Ionic is logically and usefully displayed on the Fitbit app. I‚Äôm a recovering heart attack patient and the heart rate data compiled in the app is essential reading for my doctor.

The accuracy of the readings is impressive and consistent and when my numbers are taken three times a week at my cardiac rehab sessions at the hospital we‚Äôve come to use the Fitbit‚Äôs heart rate number over that of the nurse‚Äôs oximeter because my Fitbit tends to do a better job filtering out the ‚Äúwhite noise‚Äù of my a-fib condition. Medical science is a data-driven discipline and being able to provide my doctor with hard data each visit is immensely valuable.

Once the challenge is over, they take a while to go away, which before it was on the main screen was fine, now that the challenge is on the main screen, they are just in the way of any new challenge. Plus you can't tell the difference between old and new challenges when you try to move them. And the main screen doesn't remember where you were when you click on a tile, so if you click on a tile, when you go back to the main screen, you return to the top, this is especially annoying if you have multiple challenges you are checking, since they are all named the same you have to find a new way to figure out which challenges you've already looked at and which you still need to look at.

However, the recent update in early July had major bugs introduced to the food log.  The app was updated within a week to address the bugs in the roll out.  I am now happier with the product and reaction time it took FitBit to address the problems.

I do wish they had a more clear way to offer feedback, suggestions, and requests.  For example, one sometime may mid-enter food nutrition data (I have done this by accident as well as having run across obviously erroneous entries).  Currently there is no clear method to report these aberrations so the log can be cleaned up.  Another example is the recent roll out of Female Health Information that can show up on your dashboard.

The app itself is great. Records the data very clearly and is easy to read. They send progress reports each week as well which are great compared to the last week. (I think it would be cool if that also got compared to your average stats) tracks all I see about and i can access it easily. Syncs very quickly as well. 

My one problem is it is very hard to read in the day light. The screen gets really dim and when on a run and I want to see my pace or trying to read a text message when it‚Äôs really bright outside it‚Äôs almost to read. I don‚Äôt know if Fitbit needs to fix that or if I can adjust it.

 I had a suggestion about the app and when you make changes to your goals (I.e. step goal, nutrition goal, etc) when you adjust your goals to be a little more intense, it makes it look like you didn‚Äôt meet your goals on past dates. Would it ever be possible to have the app updated so that when you update your goals it only affects entries and logs going forward from that change? Example, I changed my calorie deficit to -750 and I used to do -500 so now when I go look at my old entries before today‚Äôs date, they make it look like I was over my goal (when I actually met the goal I had been working on at that time.) just a suggestion that would not only help you see how often you are changing your goals but also to help you not feel discouraged when you look back and see that you didn‚Äôt actually exceed your calorie intake for the day, just had an old goal. :) I know for me personally, it would be really nice to see this update, but overall this Fitbit has changed my life!";"2020-03-12T04:17:43-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=462638897&type=Purple%20Software";"462638897";214;"en";"POSITIVE"

HOWEVER since the update right before GOOGLE BOUGHT FITBIT, you are now required to keep location on ‚Äúalways‚Äù instead of ‚Äúwhile using app‚Äù, which uses a ton of data and drains your battery. My phone told me one day that Fitbit had fetched my location 49 times that day. FORTY NINE TIMES. No wonder my battery lasted half a day instead of 2. 
You were always required to have the app open on your phone to track GPS during an activity (i.e. while using the app, makes sense), not at all an inconvenience. I think they are using the new ‚Äúauto start‚Äù tracking feature as an excuse, but it‚Äôs really to mine all the data because that feature is useless. 
Now, since I refuse to pay to be another cog in the Google machine, I have to switch my setting to ‚Äúalways‚Äù from ‚Äúwhile using the app‚Äù every other day when I start a run. Not fun.

Or I can‚Äôt get it to stop on the day I want. Why can‚Äôt we just select the dates manually without having to drag a bar? Also sometimes periods are irregular and maybe last a day or two and then go away for a day or two and come back, but the way this app does it currently is that you cannot add two separate periods in one month. You can only add the one so you cannot get it to display accurately at all. Make it so you can manually select each day and put in whether or not your period was on that day. I use Flow for my main period tracking since that app is dedicated to that and a million times better but I‚Äôd also like to track it in my Fitbit app since that‚Äôs where all my other health data is stored.

I have no tried following all the steps given on the Fitbit app to help resolve this issue, I‚Äôve tried emailing fit but with still no response, and still having the same issue with not receiving texts although phone calls now all of a sudden come through. Being that my fit bit was not cheap when purchased I would think customer service would be more helpful and any issues regarding the way it should work would be resolved. Disappointed this feature is no longer working being that in my job I depend on texts coming through my watch while I‚Äôm working and knowing if I‚Äôm needing to get back to a text ASAP being it‚Äôs a client of mine or knowing I can continue doing my job and get back to whoever it may be later.

I like all of the things it tracks and wear it pretty religiously. I was hoping to be able to use it to compare how my activity changes throughout a typical year. I would like it 10x better, though, if the app weren‚Äôt so glitchy. Every once in a while it just ‚Äúdecides‚Äù not to sync, my watch will say I got 12/12 hours active for the day and the app will only say 8/12 or so. After the last update (Oct 2, 2019), it also quit automatically tracking walks/runs (they now need to be manually put in) and for some reason the ‚Äúactive minutes‚Äù update throughout the day with no movement - sometimes even going backwards. I had 21 yesterday at 2 o‚Äôclock and then by the time I went to bed it only said 9... when I had gone for a walk/run after 2. Wish they‚Äôd fix all of this nonsense with the app so it gave a more realistic idea of activity...

Update, December 2019: I‚Äôve officially had this thing for a year and it‚Äôs great when the app cooperates. Really rather frustrating when it doesn‚Äôt. Make all of the minutes/hours/steps?

It wakes me up better than a sound alarm plus it doesn‚Äôt bother my partner in the mornings. 

Recently, fitbit updated the app, changes the appearance of the dashboard. It is a stylish new update, but takes up more space than the previous version. Before, you could easily look at your stats at a glance. However, the update requires you to scroll quite a bit to see everything. 

In addition, the update has made it more difficult to set the silent alarms. Instead of being able to add it from the main page, users now have to navigate to the account page, then the fitbit settings, and then finally access the silent alarms.

The display options in the app seem to focus more on the time or animal faces and icons vs one of the main reasons to purchase the HR version.

I bought it four years ago when I knew I needed to do something to improve my health. I wore it for 2 weeks to get a baseline (at that time I was only averaging about 1500 steps per day). I set my first step goal for 2000 steps per day. As I consistently made the goal I have increased it. It is currently set at 10,000 steps per day but I consistently average closer to 13,000. Using Fitbit to track my progress have been highly motivating.  

Fitbit has been instrumental in tracking personal goals exercise goals (thank you Fitbit!) which, along with a different eating plan,  have changed my life. My only complaint is when I increase my step goal, I no longer get credit for reaching my goal (in the past) when my step goal was lower. It would be great if the app would ‚Äúremember‚Äù what the goal was at a given date so I could keep my stars.

Bad update. Fitbit, everyone agrees! Overall the app does what I need it to-or it did. What happened to the sleep time average???

I have been a FitBit wearer for a number of years, and have had several models.  The newest update to the appt that gives or assigns sleep scores is frustrating because the data is not accurate, not is there any way to adjust or correct the data.  After studying the scores over time (which are inconsistent), I have identified one problem that impacts the inaccuracies of these scores.  I spend a period of time in bed, but not asleep each night as a ‚Äúwind down‚Äù period. This time is counted as awake (as it should be), but it is not really time that I was trying to sleep. The new tool counts this time as awake, but it is a negative factor in the sleep score and the score is not a good depiction of the quality of the actual time asleep. I wish the app contained a button (like Apple Health) that allowed the user to initial the sleep analysis process.

Pls. address this issue & fix this cause it‚Äôs just not right that the Ionic is still quite new but something‚Äôs already not working  quite right specially that we purchased this for $299!!! PLS.

There‚Äôs still a handful of issues that could be resolved which would improve it further. One is the sync issue on the trail challenges. Another is that if using iPhone X and you win a challenge, there‚Äôs no way to X out of the display of your trophy because the X is nested too high on the left of the screen. Third is intuitive functionality. It should be easy to tap something on the app to see your day, week, month stats. Also, the ability to set a date range for step calculations. Fourth, the interactions between steppers on the app is clunky. There‚Äôs no way to respond directly to someone‚Äôs comment in a challenge. 

Still dig the app, just could be better. 

Lastly, this is probably a stupid request, but I like using this app and being able to challenge people if I were to switch to another device. Say I were to get an Apple Watch as a gift. No more Fitbit application. It seems to me that you all would do well to allow other devices to sync to your app. You‚Äôd open a whole world of new users.

I‚Äôm not one to Leave feedback or ratings very often just for the sake of reading something. I typically have to wait to see how an item will perform. That said, I would recommend a Fitbit if you are  serious about tracking your workouts, macros, and sleep.

I only gave it four stars because I don‚Äôt think it tracks as well as a garment in terms of mileage. I wore my Garman and my Fitbit at the same time and if it was a little bit off.

Makes me question all data from my Fitbit.  I think it is time for this loyal customer to switch to a competitor who is better at software & algorithms! 

App has gone down hill.  Sleep score is nonsense & Sleep algorithm is a fail - it tacks on awake time after you wake up every single day!  If you edit it, it mangles the rest of your sleep data.  
Woke up at 8:11 with 6h32m of sleep, but the app makes it 8:17....  ok, I can edit that awake time off, right?  Well not quite, by subtracting 6 minutes awake time (via edit sleep log option) the algorithm somehow makes my sleep time go to 6h23m & my awake time instead increases from 37 to 40 minutes!  This happens every day & makes their scoring/data utterly worthless.  What other data are their algorithms is it mangling?  The algorithm needs to be re-evaluated as it seems to have gotten worse in recent years!";"2020-11-02T07:54:33-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=462638897&type=Purple%20Software";"462638897";219;"en";"NEGATIVE"

The first is that, as far as I can tell, the app still doesn‚Äôt have a dark mode. This is ridiculous considering many check this app before bed and after waking up. The app‚Äôs GUI is mostly white which makes is really hard on the eyes! 
Secondly, it takes way too many steps to get to the page for setting the watch‚Äôs alarms. This should be easily accessible from the home screen, not 4 menus deep. 
Third, sometimes when adjusting the start/end of recorded sleep the data will change from detailed to simplified, and this cannot be reverted - really frustrating if you‚Äôve only adjusted the time by a few minutes and now the data has been scrapped. There should be a warning dialogue and an option to revert, or better, the ability to have some of the sleep data be detailed and some simplified.";"2020-08-25T09:21:00-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=462638897&type=Purple%20Software";"462638897";183;"en";"NEGATIVE"

The step counting is helpful. Reminders to move after being stationary for a while are incredibly useful. Period tracking has been super efficient. Hydration reminders are nifty but it would be nice if the time were more customizable so the reminders could be more frequent. Overall I‚Äôve always sworn by this app for fitness tracking. 

However, the app does need some work.

I‚Äôve denied access to my location hundreds of times over the last year but it still keeps asking. It‚Äôs annoying! If I wanted to turn location on I would but I‚Äôm not doing anything that requires location tracking. 

The most recent update (March 2021) has made the app slower and scrolling lags. The sleep function has major issues. If I tap on the sleep function it causes the app to freeze and sometimes it will work itself out after a few minutes but mostly I have to close the app. I‚Äôve given up on using the sleep function since it slows everything down so much. 

Also since the most recent update the period tracker now defaults to the month and year I was born. This is bizarre. I haven‚Äôt found a quick way to get to today‚Äôs date so there‚Äôs a lot of scrolling involved and it takes a bit for all the recent info to load once I get there.

After applying an app update and then starting to track an exercise the app will drop tracking in the middle of an exercise and try to log it while you‚Äôre still going, only ever recording the first couple minutes of a workout. The next update seems to restore functionality but again with this last update it has reverted back to a broken status. The reliability issues with the app are a big concern now, it‚Äôs frustrating to go through the process and do the work only to find out post-workout that app couldn‚Äôt perform the main job it was built to do. I cringe now when I seen an update notification for the Fitbit app. I have been a Fitbit user for years now and have been relatively happy for the most part, but with the durability issues of the all the wrist trackers I‚Äôve had in the past and now the app bugs I have begun to look elsewhere.";"2019-04-04T13:11:13-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=462638897&type=Purple%20Software";"462638897";209;"en";"NEGATIVE"

For me, observing the exercise app on my Ionic sometimes keep track of my exercise and sometimes not, made me feel cheated as if I was not getting credit for my work. About 40% of the time it is off on its own, not showing me anything close to the numbers the same bike ride has done in other days. Unreliability = irritability (and thus I check the Fitbit less and less frequently, since it is as often as not- an irritation.

I have a Versa and I love it! My husband bought me the Apple Watch and I returned it after trying it for a week. My Fitbit Versa goes everything I want and is easy to use. The charge on it lasts at least 5 days, usually a week for me! The accuracy on the step count is about 10-15% less than a stepcounter that you would wear on your waist, but often I am on my phone, holding it up with  the hand I wear my Fitbit on. However, my Fitbit Versa was far more accurate than the Apple Watch I tried, even after calibrating the Apple. 
Love the Versa and Fitbit app!
The only thing that I wish it had was GPS. That is the reason I tried the Apple Watch in the first place. But it ended up that I still liked the verse some more. My husband has the Fitbit watch that has the GPS on that, but that‚Äôs way too huge for my small wrist. 
One more thing that‚Äôs better about the versa than the Apple Watch is the size of it and how nicely it feels on my wrist. The Apple Watch has a rounded back that felt awkward and its charge couldn‚Äôt last 24 hours. Not helpful if you‚Äôre trying to track sleep. Or if you don‚Äôt want to plug it in every night.

I recently upgraded to a Charge 4 - the device works except for getting notifications.  No reminders to get up and move, no celebration when I reach 10K steps, no email, text or phone calls notifications.  Part of why I upgraded to this Fitbit is for these nice perks.  After exhausting every online troubleshooting step (multiple times) and online chat (again with troubleshooting) and finally a phone call (two more times going thru troubleshooting steps) I was shunted off to an email technician who said sorry can‚Äôt replace your defective unit as it‚Äôs a glitch with the iOS we‚Äôre working to fix - then silence.  That was over a week ago and still no resolution.  I have a friend who has a different device and hers works just fine.

The only issue is that I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs intelligent enough (yet) to be as accurate as the HealthKit app when it comes to registering actual exercise activity for the day. 

I say this because I drove to the local Walgreen‚Äôs a week ago, and it registered my drive as actual ‚Äúexercise‚Äù activity. On the other hand, the HealthKit app has been able to keep track of all my activity very, very accurately. The customer support team at Fitbit is well aware that there are issues with the app once you go for a drive. 

I suggest integration with the HealthKit app would help a lot. I think it would address my 1 or 2 concerns I have.

Syncing their fitbits (in addition to my own) with my phone and viewing their data is way too much trouble. Even if it worked properly, it‚Äôs a many, many tap process designed for kids to view their own data. To get back to mine I have to re-enter my password, and it doesn‚Äôt work right with LastPass so I have to do it manually. Since I don‚Äôt actually let the kids use the app on my phone, this security step is unnecessary. 

More importantly, switching between parent and kid view is buggy. It often takes a long time or times out entirely, requiring a force quit and also logging me out of the app in the process. So then I log into my account, repeat the many taps to reach one of theirs, and hope it works better on the next attempt. Of course, my kids also have to be willing to stay near me for this whole thing and not run around as they prefer to do.

I even called the help line shortly after purchase believing I received a faulty product only to be told to try and rotate it to the underside of my wrist or hold my arm pointing down for a few seconds so it could get a better reading. Sometimes it would go minutes without providing any information displaying - - instead of a heart rate. It just was too frustrating to use during workouts. The rest of the time it seems to keep track of my daily activities and monitors my resting heart rate fairly well, however, outside of light exercising-it seems those that are into HIIT or very physical exercise take risks using this product.

Their watches have ongoing issues with syncing to the app and without this basic level of functionality-the watch is useless as a fitness tracker. Syncing discrepancies make data jump around wildly. Activities that seemed to log successfully, disappear after syncing. Step counts double, then disappear. Updates to the app create more problems than they solve.

I‚Äôve wrote the company, chatted, sent photos. They always say ‚Äúwe will get back to you‚Äù they don‚Äôt. Also the logging food ap is lousy. Every time I hit ‚Äúlog and add more‚Äù it will add the whole weeks worth of food to that day. If you‚Äôre trying to decided on a fitness tracker, maybe try a company that fixes complaints and responds to you. My workout journey has been SO important to me. I wish it was to them. We are considering switching to a new device. I‚Äôm so heartbroken. I had loved this before. The company was SO responsive before (had a broken Fitbit). I‚Äôm not sure what happened but it feels like they no longer care and no longer correct problems.";"2021-02-23T04:15:18-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=462638897&type=Purple%20Software";"462638897";196;"en";"NEGATIVE"

My favorite features are:
-sleep charts
-social posts/forums
-easy manual edits/corrections/entries for exercises & sleep (when needed)(my daughter‚Äôs garmin is a pain to enter or correct manually)
-daily exercise tracking chart, where it simply puts a dot on a calendar, and confirms you exercised ‚Äú3 of 4 days this week‚Äù!  That was a simple feature that got me hooked on doing even just 5 minutes of exercise in a morning routine!

Some issues/bugs include:
-very confusing or ambiguous definitions of ‚Äúexercise zone‚Äù vs ‚Äúactive minutes‚Äù vs ‚Äúcardio‚Äù etc
-graphs sometimes mis-loading half the month when scrolling back in time
-occasional sync issues with new updates
-constant internet usage prior to syncing & displaying watch data
-a limit on how many challenges you can do‚Äîunless you pay the monthly premium fee (which is constantly advertised 
-very poor performance (recently) for viewing sleep data on my iPhone SE (older model)
-social forums and some data view options aren‚Äôt accessible between phone and PC interfaces

Bonus notes:
-If your watch breaks within 1 year, contact Fitbit, and they will often replace it (get the warranty‚Äîeither store or fitbit 2yr, as many watches last only 1-2 years)
-Via PC (or I‚Äôd assume Mac, too), you can request a download of all your fitbit data.  (Look around for this request option.)";"2021-04-18T15:06:06-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=462638897&type=Purple%20Software";"462638897";235;"en";"POSITIVE"

-I would like to be able to create ‚Äúmeals‚Äù from my app without having to go on my computer. There should be a ‚Äúcreate a meal‚Äù button in the food logging section. As someone who plans their meals (and cooks) weekly, it would be a very good feature to have. If you are making food from scratch, it‚Äôs more time-consuming to keep putting in the same recipes over and over.

-The macronutrient counting should have more features. Currently, it only shows macro percentages. The graphs are a nice visual but they‚Äôre of very little use/help. I would like to be able to see an organized count (not just percentages) of all of my macros for the day- not just in a pie chart or graph.

-The sleep feature is nice. I always like to see how well I‚Äôm sleeping. I have the Sleep Cycle app (I HIGHLY recommended it for those who have trouble getting up in the morning), and it has a feature that attempts to wake you up close to a predetermined time when you are in a light sleep state.

Sleep - when I correct the wake up time it causes a complete recalculation of deep sleep and REM tome that goes beyond just the change in the time interval of denominator for percentage of that type of sleep - the graph also changes and sometimes in significant ways.  This is certainly counter intuitive although it might be legitimate.  Still, if legitimate they should provide some explanation for the radical ‚Äúre-categorization‚Äù of sleep intervals between REM, deep and light.

For the weight graphs - the 1-week, 1-month and 1 year views should all show a graph for the past interval of the same length.  Example - the week view- if it‚Äôs Tuesday it should show the last 7 days (not just Sunday Monday Tuesday).

After using several pieces of FitBit gear the app connection is moderately stable. 

The app has some bugs and after almost a year of communicating still only gets ‚Äúthank you and we are working on that issue‚Äù. They are not though. 

It still does not handle multiple devices reliably and often loses the majority of your stats when you try.   Even after years of the issues this is still an issue. 

Challenge Messages are truncated on the iPhone platform and have been for a year.   When people complain in the community their posts are often deleted. 

As they have try to expand the app it is getting harder to use with many unused features getting in the way of daily and weekly usage. 

It is pretty stable and does not crash often though you do have to exit and reload the app to update stats timely. The pull-down refresh does not sync completely. 

When it works well it is 4 stars and we like it a lot. When it doesn‚Äôt work it is 1-2 stars.  

This month it is back to 2 stars due to continued support and app issues.   

We have used about 10 Fitbit devices in our home over time and some have been great, and some not so much. Improving customer service and follow through would help a great deal.

Fitbit, if you‚Äôre going to update, PLEASE listen to your customers. I have seen hundreds of comments with the same complaints. Listen to us, please.

First issue: Notifications Disappearing
One of my issues is that my text notifications disappear if I read them on my phone. Please make this an OPTIONAL feature! I don‚Äôt want them disappearing on their own and many others are not happy since 2018. Two years and this is still happening? Fitbit, come ON!

Second issue: Vibration Weakness
The vibration on both Inspire HR and 2, some Charges, and some Versas are too weak! The non-watch trackers have no way to adjust. Please make the vibration range bigger so it can be customized! I don‚Äôt know if this can be an app feature, but you should include this for ALL Fitbit products.

Now for the good:
The app is great and the challenges are awesome. The app itself rarely has issues. I love the extra stuff that Premium gives, but it‚Äôs too expensive for me to justify. Otherwise, the actual Fitbit app is great.

Now it‚Äôs horribly inefficient for sleep tracking, which is one of the main features I require it for. Now if you wake up for any reason during your sleep cycle it stops tracking at that point, even if you go back to sleep for several hours. Some nights it doesn‚Äôt track any sleep whatsoever. 

Additionally, don‚Äôt break a sweat while exercising or it will stop tracking your heart rate. This has been an issue off and on for me and I‚Äôve had 3 different Fitbit devices over the years. However this has gotten worse with the latest update. My Versa is water resistant so it‚Äôs mind blowing that sweating would be an issue. Tracking my heart rate while I exercise is the main reason I purchased a Fitbit device to being with, so for me this is a catastrophic failure and I will be switching brands if it doesn‚Äôt improve soon.

 When entering food items singularly it is more or less satisfactory, however because I do a lot of cooking (using many fresh ingredients and not just purchased items with nutritional info) it becomes cumbersome. Many similar food tracking apps allow you to enter customizable recipes which allows ease of both frequenting that recipe and also using many mass ingredients and then dividing the nutritional information down by the portion size. The fact that I can‚Äôt find this function in the Fitbit food tracker is a BIG detractor. So every time I make salsa for my family I have to look at my bowl and guesstimate ‚ÄúI think there are probably 3 oz of tomatoes in there? And 1/16 an onion??‚Äù

It would be a good idea for you to download your data from time to time if it is important to you I case Fitbit goes belly up.

For reference, I have the latest update on iPhone XR and latest update on the Fitbit Inspire. 

Too often my exercises on the elliptical do not get tracked as an exercise. Instead, they track as active minutes. If I try to manually log my exercise, then my active minutes will show the exercise twice under active minutes. 

I‚Äôve also had issues with my weight logs. My total weight lost was not being recorded correctly and I had to do some weird work around to get it sorted. So far, it seems to be working. 

Notifications from my phone that show up on the Fitbit disappear way too fast if I do not look at it right away. Not sure if it‚Äôs a bug or how the Fitbit is set up to be. Would be nice if they stayed longer or an option to scroll down to read them again if they have not been read on the phone.

Not sure if this problem is the app or my Fitbit; but the majority of the time when I open the app to sync, it appears like it‚Äôs trying to sync but it doesn‚Äôt connect to my Fitbit Inspire HR.

I purchased the Inspire HR in March of this year, so I‚Äôve had it now for about 3 months. 

I have also noticed as some other reviewers have stated that my Fitbit counts steps while I‚Äôm driving, but that has nothing to do with the app (as far as I‚Äôm aware).

But I do have some suggestions to improve it:
-Add badges and trophies to the Fitbit watch; not only in the app, and add daily and weekly challenges to the Fitbit watch and app. Currently, the Fitbit app has badges and trophies, but you cannot receive them or see them on your watch. It would be better to send a notification to the watch once one has achieved a badge or trophy, and then be able to access and look at the badges and trophies on the watch. It would also be great if there was new challenges to try to keep people motivated and receive badges once finishing the challenge. The challenges could be from yoga to jogging to tread-milling, it would be amazing and benefit everyone to have a new daily challenge.
-Be able to set not only vibrating silent alarms, but both vibrating and sounding alarms. Many people don‚Äôt wake up because the Fitbit silent alarms are very quiet, or they wake up and fall right back asleep since the alarms don‚Äôt wake them up enough. It would be beneficial to have an option to set a vibrating, sounding alarm, so we wake up and stay awake.

The ONE thing that really lacks is the food tracking interface and potential.

It the design looks like it‚Äôs from 10+ years ago with a VERY basic list of what you ate and the calories, I mean it looks like someone put the bare amount of effort in developing this app.

Another app I used broke down EACH individual item you scanned giving it a grade to how healthy it was, explained the pros and cons of eating that and broke down the nutritional information in a beautiful screen. More so, each grade for items you are in a meal were added up to give each meal a overall grade which could be easily compared to the past week to see how your meal habits are improving or not. 

Going forward I‚Äôd like to see Fitbit put a little more effort into this area of the app because it just give off the impression that they think people don‚Äôt use it but in all honesty for those of us who do use it, it adds to the Fitbit lifestyle.";"2020-10-07T10:45:59-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=462638897&type=Purple%20Software";"462638897";260;"en";"POSITIVE"

I still do not sleep enough. Now that Fitbit is giving us a sleeping score, I am getting less REM than ever. Last night I slept 7 hours and 21 minutes, and yet I only had 28 minutes of deep sleep.

Second is the poor quality of the band that this comes with the product. My two-year-old watch is held together with duct tape. Third issue is the battery. The battery  should be easy to change when a new one is required. It isn‚Äôt. Apparently Fitbit expects users to buy a new watch when the battery dies.

However they state on their website that they use location only while using the app. May be easier programming to ask for full permission, but look at the blowback Uber got last year for requesting full permission for GPS location. 

In order to get heart rate, you must also track exercise on the fitbit device. So when done with a run, you have to stop tracking on both device and app. Best part is that you get duplicate entries in the app! Last issue is that the distance on device (calculated using steps) and app (tracked using GPS) is FAR off. Example is 2.6 miles on GPS vs 1.8 miles on device.  That is almost a 50% error! Yikes! They state that various factors influence distance, but still seems like a big difference. 

Heart rate monitoring appears to also use steps to filter out errant readings. When using an elliptical machine, it says my heart rate is 100bpm when should be around 150. Never have this problem running.

Paying $200 for a tracker should mean that the app and its features should come included except for any add on content. Your Fitbit already collects heart rate data and movement data. Now, they‚Äôre trying to make you pay $9.99 to see the data your Fitbit is already collecting.

2.) More often than not when I go for a very long run (5 miles or more) it will split the run/workout into two different types of exercises with two different duration times instead than just one.

3.) I work out twice a day doing multiple exercise routines (e.g. 5 miles or more cardio run in the AM, resistance training and another cardio routine in the PM) and more often than not, at the end of the day, when I sync the Fitbit device to the app it only show one exercise routine only.

I was fascinated by pre-and post surgery data collected which really showed how I was off baseline for my sleep patterns and heartbeat (increased).

I love the simplicity of my Fitbit charge 4 it isn‚Äôt a smart watch. So no annoying endless notifications and complicated complications to mess with. 

So I love the fitness tracker and I‚Äôm really enjoying the app. It seems a bit more playful than the Apple health app. Which I think it‚Äôs cute but could also use some...refinement I suppose.I like that There are more customization options, and more actions available rather than outsourcing an activity to another app. (Eg meditations can be done and tracked thru Fitbit app where as Apple health meditation is just tracked and the activity would be done in headspace or something) 

Anyways...I‚Äôd like to see a night time function. Since I like to do meditations at night in bed. White background comes in bright even with my display dimmed and in night mode.

As for the app, here‚Äôs my feedback:

- The challenges are fun and motivating, and I like to keep the notifications on because my friends and I encourage each other (or talk trash to one another) via the app. However, that paired with the FitBit ‚Äúmotivational‚Äù notifications becomes a bit much. I ended up turning all notifications off, but it would be great if we could select which types of notifications we want (messages from friends vs all notifications vs chatter etc) and the frequency of motivational notifications (once a day would be enough for me).

- Love the fact that we can now tag others in the chat, would also be great if we can post photos in the chat of our walks of whatever workout we‚Äôre doing

- Since iOS 11, I frequently open the app and get the message that my device can‚Äôt sync because Bluetooth is off, even though when I doublecheck my bluetooth is on. Not sure if this is something FitBit or Apple have to fix, but it does need a fix. I need my steps to sync dammit so I can win these challenges.

Let me start by saying, I do love the Premium workouts - the number of the workouts available, the variety, and the ability to choose different levels of difficulty. 

However, lately, I feel increasing frustration at a number of things. First, my Versa 2 has been increasing in glitches and has difficulty syncing despite following all of the steps on the FitBit help page. I‚Äôve deleted and redownloaded/reconnected multiple times. 
Secondly, the calorie count is way off from what the guided programs say they are and what my watch reads. Lastly, the difference between my treadmill and my watch is 1/2 a mile! Not even close to what I run. It‚Äôs gettin worse every time I run on the treadmill which is where I do most my running with 4 kids, a pandemic, and cold weather climate. 

I have reached out for help with support center and the delay in response is days, sometimes weeks and they have suggested things that I told them I had already done. So it‚Äôs like they aren‚Äôt actually reading what I wrote in the emails.

Oct 31 ‚Äò18: Yet another update, another failed attempt at fixing a basic feature. In the past year, there have been 25 updates of the app, but they still haven‚Äôt fixed the settings to change the units, time zone, etc.
My Aria scale shows the correct units, but the app doesn‚Äôt. App doesn‚Äôt save any advanced settings. Setting time zone to Automatic doesn‚Äôt change anything; it doesn‚Äôt recognize my location.

Update Nov 1 ‚Äò18: I received a dev response, but it was no help: ‚ÄúWe'd like to clarify that the option to change units on the Fitbit app is available.‚Äù followed by a link. I know there is an option, obviously, but it doesn‚Äôt work. ‚ÄúIn addition, we suggest force stopping the Fitbit app and rebooting your mobile device.‚Äù I did this, but it didn‚Äôt help.
I actually figured it out myself: First you have to login to the Dashboard to change your preferred units settings. Then after this, in the app, advanced settings should save after you change them. This works for whatever reason. 
As for the time zone, they simply suggest manually setting it, which is fair. But it could take a while to find your correct time zone: you have to scroll through a ton of cities and figure out which one is closest to you. 

Other than the extended frustrations with the Fitbit app‚Äôs settings, I‚Äôd say the app is fine.";"2018-11-01T07:20:45-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=462638897&type=Purple%20Software";"462638897";237;"en";"POSITIVE"

Doesn't even let me create a Fitbit account to set up my device. It keeps prompting me to log in with Facebook or Google. Tried both ways and also by entering the email and password I had just created and it tells me every time that the user does not exist. Tried two different emails and got the same issue.

It tracked steps, distance, activities, and heart rate, and reminded me to move, and alerted me to calls and texts. 

Lately though, Fitbit seems obsessed with competing with the more expensive smart watches. And every time they release a new product, and upgrade the app and software, my older Fitbit stops working as well as it did before. 

First it was the accuracy of the heart monitor. Then, they removed the heart rate from tracked exercise (something that many people have complained about for over a month) and haven‚Äôt bothered to fix it.

I purchased my first Fitbit as a Mother‚Äôs Day present for myself on May 10, 2015. I‚Äôve never had to replace it. I‚Äôve always wondered why folks around me, younger, always claimed it malfunctioned and/or they lost it to get you as a company to replace it for free. My original Fitbit still works.

I used to walk all the time, then I was diagnosed with breast cancer and couldn‚Äôt. Currently I‚Äôm going through breast cancer for the third time therefore I can‚Äôt walk right now however I can‚Äôt wait to beat it this 3rd time and begin to walk again with my Fitbit. 

I will walk with my Fitbit again and use the fabulous food calculator that comes with it. 

I hope mine never stop working and I hope I can find some more wrist bands that close like a watch instead of the one you press into your wrist. I also wish the bands came in breast cancer pink. 

I hope one day afford 2 Fitbit‚Äôs a month to put in my monthly baskets I make for random women (most perfect strangers) who are going through to encourage them to take charge of their health. It will happen.

FITbit privacy policy is ‚ÄúTrust FitBit‚Äù. My response is ‚ÄúGO TO HELL FITBIT ‚Äù. I will not Trust FitBit with my fitness data. Should be my choice not to share my fitness data.  Fitbit app is flawed. Fitbit privacy is flawed.
If Fitbit doesn‚Äôt give me the option of not sharing data, all else is just stupid excuses to snoop on others privacy and use of data in ways that might be totally unacceptable to the owner.

At 40 years old, the zone calculation has me in line with a 25 year old‚Äôs cardio and peak zones, which is almost unachievable.  This has been addressed many times on their discussion forum, but development has not made changes yet.

1. The dashboard where it gives you a highlight of all your stats you‚Äôre tracking doesn‚Äôt always update my calorie intake after I have logged a food. Today is the first day I‚Äôve noticed this happening and I hope it didn‚Äôt happen in the past. I use the dashboard a lot to get a quick glimpse of how many calories I have left to consume before making food decisions. 

2. I am not sure how food gets in the database but today I noticed a discrepancy when I was logging JUST Egg today. I scanned the barcode on the bottle and according to the bottle 3 Tbs is 70 calories. However, when I scanned the bottle to the FitBit app, it told me 3 Tbs is 45 calories. There needs to be some type of accuracy check or something. 

3. I had an issue logging my PF Chang‚Äôs meal yesterday. There‚Äôs 2 instances of PF Chang‚Äôs menus with different nutrition information for the same foods. It was cumbersome to get through and I had to go on the PF Chang website to verify the calorie information. Definitely didn‚Äôt make this convenient. 

All in all, I like my FitBit but I feel the app needs more improvement.

2) sleep tracking randomly goes back and forth from the new more advanced version where it shows your awake, REM, light, deep sleep with percentages to the older version where it‚Äôs just awake, asleep, restless.

I also really wish it offered a little more. For example, it would be nice if you could challenge friends to more than step challenges but also, work outs/week or maybe active minutes. And the workouts available to select are very limited too. I do hot yoga, which is different from regular yoga in your calorie burn, as is Bikram. Or interval training, or tabata. There‚Äôs a lot of different exercise methods and basically all I end up being able to put it yoga and calisthenics. It just doesn‚Äôt feel as accurate.

If I was being even more picky or imagining an even more ideal app, it would be nice if you could program in more specific personal information and the app could adjust to give more accurate information like your calorie burn could be varied based on your level of fitness (higher or lower basal metabolism), or you could get an estimated bmi by giving your measurements and track it over time.

I have been part of several chats within fitbit community asking for an improvement to show macros and percentages AND grams on the App for over a year. 

All the moderators do is say nice things. No one actually tells us it‚Äôs on the list to be done, or it won‚Äôt be done or maybe it will be done. No one responds. 

It is available on the website already. But not the App. Honestly, if you‚Äôre using a Fitbit product, chances are you use your phone-not a computer or laptop to track your food, because you‚Äôre more active.  

It is well documented that many many many people want this. 

What‚Äôs most disturbing is that no one from the fitbit team ever comments on any of these. It seems to me that fitbit doesn‚Äôt care about what their users want from the app. Even when it‚Äôs something very common on other apps. 

Sad that they tout themselves as a leader in user interface and have ignored this user suggestion since 2013. It‚Äôs on the website. It shouldn‚Äôt be hard to put it on the Phone App. 

In the main chat I am in we have collectively decided that the only way to get someone to hear us is to rate the product.  Sorry. But it‚Äôs true. 

Something needs to be done. Come on Fitbit, be the leaders in the industry you say you are.

The weight layout was changed. It used to tell you a range of weight where you‚Äôre ‚Äúgood‚Äù if you‚Äôre trying to maintain weight. Now it constantly tells you you either need to lose or gain weight if you aren‚Äôt logging that exact maintenance weight as your current. This is very discouraging and unhelpful because people‚Äôs bodies will *always* be fluctuating and I don‚Äôt want to have my health app telling me I‚Äôm in need of losing weight or gaining it when I‚Äôm within a pound or two of the maintenance weight.

The sleep layout was changed. Instead of telling you your average sleep across a week, month, or year‚Äîyou can only see your sleep score. This does not help me because what I am most concerned with is my hours of sleep per night, and now I can‚Äôt check on that at all unless I do exorbitant amounts of math! 

Beyond those two issues, I do enjoy my Fitbit.

This is my second FitBit. The first was replaced due to issues with the watch. Considered tossing the FitBit for something else but they took care of me. This time, I have a feeling I will be going to Apple or Garmin or another brand that can do what I need, especially if I‚Äôm paying for premium specifically for the sleep analysis and it doesn‚Äôt work.";"2020-08-13T04:56:47-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=462638897&type=Purple%20Software";"462638897";170;"en";"POSITIVE"

I believe that the quality of your sleep plays a huge role in the quality of your life so this new feature is really good for keeping me aware of my sleeping habits. 

I‚Äôve noticed that a recent update changed the main dashboard and the silent alarm feature is no longer on there. Instead, I would have to click a few more times to get to that page and to set my alarms. The silent alarms are a peaceful way for me to wake up instead of my phone alarms that abruptly wake me up. One suggestion I would give is it place the silent alarms feature back on the main page for easier access!";"2019-09-12T01:36:56-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=462638897&type=Purple%20Software";"462638897";141;"en";"POSITIVE"

I‚Äôve switched to an Apple Watch at one point and hated it, so I went back to Fitbit purchasing the Versa, which I absolutely loved.  This is still my current watch.  Ever since I have done the last IOS update I no longer am receiving my message notifications.   I have done all the troubleshooting mentioned.  I have turned off my Fitbit.  I had Bluetooth forget the device and reloaded it.   I did a factory reset.  And still have nothing.  I have emailed Fitbit on multiple occasions and have just received a response that they are working on the issue.  This has been months and I‚Äôm over waiting.  At this point I am doing research on other brands of fitness watches.  I receive all other notifications except my text messages.

I get very few activity points for any water exercise.  The app used to let me go in and tell it that I had been doing water exercise so I could get the appropriate minutes, but it no longer does that.  For example, I did an hour of water aerobics this morning and received credit for 26 active minutes.  I was jumping and using my arms the entire time (this was not a little old ladies class, and yes, I‚Äôm exhausted), and my heart rate got high, but the Fitbit isn‚Äôt recognizing my exercise.  I really want to use my Fitbit to coordinate all of my activity to get a true picture of what I‚Äôm doing; after all, that was the whole point of purchasing it in the first place.

Very strange!! In fact the watch face I was using suddenly caused the Ionic to produce an error message that told me to try another watch. What?? Do you test yours updates before you release them?

Update:

I received a response from the developer, but it‚Äôs useless now, since a restore to factory settings put my Ionic into such a state that a firmware update never completes. Yes, my Ionic is bricked. Even after issuing the 5th factory reset, it‚Äôs still stuck in a never ending loop after starting the update. Terrible design! FitBits are very susceptible to update failures. It happens a lot. I‚Äôm tired of either poorly designed software or poor physical construction, both of which I‚Äôve experienced with FitBits over the years.

   I was very excited to get my Fitbit from my husband for Christmas this year. I originally asked for a Pok√©mon Go Gotcha. So I was so sad to see that my Fitbit doesn‚Äôt work with adventure sync, because Pok√©mon Go is a great motivator for me. Besides walking the treadmill, but who wants to hold their phone while walking on a treadmill? Plus the phone doesn‚Äôt pickup all my movement on the treadmill. 

   On the positive side, the watch is comfortable for me even while sleeping. I love that is tracks my sleep. It tells me to get up and move around or advises me that I am almost at my walking goal. This does make me move around a bit more. All in all I like what it does. It does everything that they designed it to do, but I would have been happy with a $30 dollar Gotcha watch.";"2019-01-07T10:13:28-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=462638897&type=Purple%20Software";"462638897";157;"en";"POSITIVE"

I have a Surge and I can't wait to upgrade to the next version with a color screen and interchangeable wristband.

The only reason I upgraded from my original Fitbit was the 3 let me wear it in the local warm water therapy pool and in my shower. 
My adults kids gifted me with a Charge 2 for Mother‚Äôs Day 2017 for the main purpose of understanding my sleep pattern better. 
As a Polio Survivor, I have struggled for years to achieve better sleep. 
Having a clear graph of my sleep has helped me work toward developing a more consistent routine and thus better, more restorative test at night. 
It also helps me understand why some mornings I feel sluggish. Seeing an erratic pattern of sleep help me understand why I don‚Äôt feel much pep in my step. A few times, it has helped me make the decision not to drive once I‚Äôd seen how poor my sleep quality had been. 
When I‚Äôve had stressful situations, like when my doctor had me staying home for over 400 days until immunized from Covid, the Meditation Mode has helped me lower my heart rate. 
I get a kick out of using the breathing technique it teaches and watching my heart rate lower.

Unfortunately Fitbit‚Äôs app does not provide much of the insight I‚Äôm looking for like pace improvement over time, aggregate HR information for workouts, or other metrics to view improvement over time (aside from their cardio score). This would be fine if they allowed open access integration with third party apps but they hold our data close to their chests and things like heart rate data aren‚Äôt available to third party apps unless they have a formal partnership between the companies which inevitably means paid subscriptions (ie Strava). 

The company does not seem receptive to continued requests from their customers to introduce a more advanced GUI, alarms that use HR data to wake you up at an ideal time in your cycle, and other features that have been requested by the community for years now.";"2019-01-03T14:38:23-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=462638897&type=Purple%20Software";"462638897";151;"en";"POSITIVE"

However, I‚Äôm extremely disappointed the unit doesn‚Äôt accurately capture treadmill activity. For example, this morning I walked on my treadmill for 45 minutes for a distance of approx 3.25 miles. The Fitbit recorded the event as 20 mins for a distance of 0.32 miles. This is known issue and I can appreciate that measuring treadmill or stationary bike exercise is different than running/walking or riding a real bike. However, there should be an option to manually enter those types of events. This option should allow entry of duration, distance, elevation climbed, and calories burned. Further the manual entries should be included in your daily statistics as if they were automatically captured by the device.";"2018-01-08T19:49:57-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=462638897&type=Purple%20Software";"462638897";136;"en";"POSITIVE"
