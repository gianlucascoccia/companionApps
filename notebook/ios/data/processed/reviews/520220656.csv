That is until today.  The app shows my thermostat is offline.    The thermostat shows being connected to my WiFi but 0 signal strength.  Why?
Other things that run on wifi are getting a signal so that is not the issue.  
This is really an annoyance for us.  I’ll wait until morning to see if it corrects itself.  If not I will again reset to factory setting and start all over again.

The unit is still working properly, I’m just unable to control it from my phone anymore.  Isn’t that kind of why it’s connected to WiFi?  Hope I get a response from them so I can fix the issues.

Now take a look at your app: old, outdated, and lacking functionality. I give it three stars, because yes, you can change your thermostats' temperatures and mode from anywhere, but you can't alter schedules, set what vacation mode does, or see whole-house runtimes. Unlike nests, your thermostats do not learn from the user's to save energy while keeping us cool, and they are boxy and unattractive on the walls. Better than standard thermostats, but not as good as a Nest or an Ecobee. Start taking cues from Nest, Venstar, and I will love you.

This doesn't even mention rookie mistakes: we set our screens to fully dimmed (off) while we don't use them, and messages do not make the backlight turn on, so you wouldn't notice a message until—by chance—we get up and change the temperature.

With the iPhone app, you can raise or lower the temperature, change the thermostat from Heating, Cooling or Auto, and control the fan (aka blower) independently if you wish. 

The iPhone app will also let you observe the running time of your equipment. The Venstar Skyport iPhone app allows you to have up to 10 different properties, with up to 10 thermostats at each property.

I LOVE the red/green LED indicator on the Venstar thermostat, it is a unique feature that I simply cannot live without.   (The LED indicator allows me to know what the thermostat is doing laying in bed with just one eye open. )

Two suggestions: 1. When it's nighttime, don't display the sun to depict a clear sky. It's 2015 and apps shouldn't need this kind of refinement. 2. With two thermostats on our account I find the toggling between the two a tad awkward and less than intuitive.

This home is different in that it is a second home and it is not feasible to control two different instances of the app on a clients phone.

While not at the home we have given the clients control over alarm, locks, garage doors and now the thermostats using the manufactures native app.

Yes we have used all manner and brand of thermostats but have never set up the Venstar’s using the Skyport app. Prepared for the “first time” problems we scheduled extra time for the learning curve.

There was non, this was by far and away the easiest to get on line (Wi-Fi) set up the app, and than get the 4 different units configured for both the control system and the native app.

As far as the graphics, we not the clients care, and that’s from a company (ours) that have graphic designer on staff. It’s about control and being able to use there from anywhere.

As far as the scheduling, it’s there, vacation mode there and the website interface was easy to use and had a lot of information about run times per unit.

We use the Venstar thermostats on 90% of our jobs (about 70 per year) and have never had an issue less one out of the box bad Wi-Fi card. I can’t say the same of other brands mentioned in other reviews.

One last note, we make no money on the units as they are sold and installed by the HVAC contractors. We are able to sell and profit from others but it’s not worth the service calls and angry clients when the manufacture bricks there units in January during a “firmware update”

As others have mentioned, 1/2 of the display is taken up with information that doesn't originate from the thermostat, at least in my case since I don't have a remote temperature sensor. That seems odd. 

On the bottom of the display is a bar that says ""Disabled due to schedule"", or ""Disabled due to Away"", but what is disabled? Why not say what it is in the message? I see from the preview photos in App Store that the bar would otherwise contain heating and cooling control buttons, but that won't be obvious if there is always a schedule set.  I suggest the message, ""Manual Controls disabled due to active schedule"" or ""...due to Away mode"".

The home button toggles between Home and Away, but is Away mode new? And if so, what are the settings for it? Does it maintain a minimum and maximum temperature? The latest version of the T2000 manual on the Venstar site is 12/17 and does not discuss Away mode in any detail.

The fan button seems to toggle between Auto and On, and yet sometimes when it switches to Auto the blade icon starts to turn, and other times it doesn't. So whatever that is trying to tell the user, the caption should change to clarify it.

When the temperature is changed it is necessary to send the changes to the thermostat, but not when the fan operation is changed. This seems inconsistent.

On my iPhone, the Venstar app was updated to the new level, and is still identified as ""Venstar"". But on my Android tablet the app simply disappeared, both from the device and from Play Store. Now the Venstar Skyport app seems to be the replacement there, but on the iPhone it's called ""Venstar"" even though it's called ""Venstar Skyport"" in the App Store. Very confusing!!

Some of these actions could be explained if there was a Help function in the app. A way to display the app version would help too.";"2019-03-16T08:26:48-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=520220656&type=Purple%20Software";"520220656";340;"en";"POSITIVE"
