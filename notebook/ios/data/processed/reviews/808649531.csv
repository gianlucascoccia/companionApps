I had to purchase two systems since I have 4 garage doors.  One down in the basement and two upstairs to the main house.  All are working very well including the open and close sensor.

At present the only drawback is the activity log.  There no way to manage the log in the AP.  Log entries just keep accumulating.  I would like to delete as I go.  Some times everything before a specific date, sometimes individual entries, or delete all.

Otherwise I have been pleased with the system and especially the customer support.";"2017-12-28T20:33:17-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=808649531&type=Purple%20Software";"808649531";102;"en";"POSITIVE"

It's easy to install and use and I had it added for the kids also (in case they forgot their key). 

The problem that I have been having is that I have to constantly ""reset"" the system because it won't work. 
This is clearly not reliable when I have to be in the house to reset this. 
After the iOS update I can only use this with Wifi also, not through data, that's inconvenient and makes this almost useless.
I hope there will be updates to correct this issue because other than that, this works PERFECT!";"2016-12-31T06:06:11-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=808649531&type=Purple%20Software";"808649531";120;"en";"POSITIVE"

I have many smart home products (Ring, Nest, WeMo, KÄ“vo) and this FAR and away the most unreliable. Constantly needs to be reset, lags, app takes forever to open/connect, & often the part where I can actually close the garage door is inoperable. After the 3/17 ""firmware upgrade"" I cannot access my device at all. No video, nothing.
