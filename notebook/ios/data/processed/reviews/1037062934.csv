For working parents and those who can’t sit next to their kids 24/7, it’s nice to have a tool that allows one to filter content and limit access to non-educational sites such as games and video/television (especially during class time) and to enforce off-screen and bed times.  

The issues I have with this app arise when there is need for kids to access content that has been filtered or access a computer beyond an allowed time frame. It takes a little research and tinkering to figure out why a certain application or webpage is being blocked. For example, the app will notify if kids have exceeded screen time parameters, but it does not notify if content is being blocked because of bedtime or off time access parameters. (Sometimes more than one blocking parameter is causative.) The app will alert kids if content is being filtered, but it takes a real sleuth to figure out what filter parameter is being triggered. When I don’t have the time to play Sherlock Holmes and dig through history, it’s just easier to temporarily disable everything, which defeats the purpose of having this app.  

In conclusion, I wish the app would tell me specifically what and why something is being blocked and easily allow me to override the block as needed.";"2020-09-11T11:39:14-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1037062934&type=Purple%20Software";"1037062934";251;"en";"POSITIVE"

As a teenager, we use our phones for everything and having our activity recorded is just not okay. Parents who don’t trust their kids don’t earn any respect from us, and it feels like they are insecure control-freaks. Instead, they could like talk to their kids or trust them to step up and tell you things. This just creates unhealthy habits and relationships.

Screentime has not only made me and my parents have a miscommunication but provoked much fights since I don’t like to be recorded and moderated since it feels like my parents don’t trust me. It bothers my studies as well since screentime somehow blocks my school websites and makes my internet twice as slower than before which causes interruptions. Screentime adds more stress to me in my opinion since if I’m doing something really important then in a matter of seconds screentime is enabled it just angers me since I’m a student who receives a lot of homework plus screentime enabling at the wrong moments.. it’s just bothering.

At first it was a little tricky figuring out which device was my son’s gaming laptop, but one I figured it out, I was golden and he was screwed.  I was able to set different bedtimes for school nights and weekends, and give him extra time when he asked so he could finish a homework assignment.

Disney Circle on Netgear is having an outage and has been since May 30th.  It’s June 5th now and a “fix” is supposed to be rolled out tomorrow night, June 6th. 

Maybe this is due to two vendors having to share technology, maybe it’s because COVID19 has slowed everything, but if any company had a 6 day outage of service they should expect to lose customers.  It’s sadly unacceptable. They should have had a better QA and a better backout plan for whatever change caused this outage.

Sometimes it is the other way. The time limit is not working. I set a two hours limit for my daughter, but she has been online for 5 hours already.

You do get a notification, but no ability to block  the new managing device. 
Once a device has been added as a manager it appears there is no way to deny it management rights. 

To make matters worse, you can set a pin in the app, but you only need to enter the pin on a cold start of the app, so if you change a permission and then let the child use your phone for something else, they are able to access the app and master pin without knowing the app pin. 

There are a few changes I would make to secure the app better: 

+ The app pin should be required every time you open the app, even if you just go to the Home Screen for a second. 

+ If there is one or more existing managers, at least one should have to approve any new mangers. 

+ The master pin should change more frequently. It should probably change every time you view it.

+ You should be able to kick out a manager.

When it works, it does exactly what it is intended to do. However, in order for the product to function, I must restart the router everyday, otherwise it will not not filter any website or enforce or even track device usage. Attempting to add or remove a device from a profile also will not work.  If a device connected to the network is not listed on the devices list, refreshing the list or opening and closing the app, restarting the phone, etc. does not help to add it.

After a restart of the router, Circle begins functioning again for about a day, after which it just stops responding, requiring another restart of the router.

And while the app has always encouraged users to subscribe to a premium set of features, it never changed the basic set of features that were initially provided. Until now. 

Recently and without warning, most of the basic features of this app have been moved behind a “premium subscription” requirement. 

They are no longer honoring the advertising claims that were listed on the packaging of their very expensive router at the time of purchase. 

Think about what this means... 
* Every 5-star review praising this app is now deceiving.
* Even the screenshots are now deceptive, showing features that were once available to the purchasers of their router without subscription, that have now been removed unless you continue to pay. 
* Parents who purchased the Nighthawk router specifically in order to gain access to this type of control have had the rug pulled out from beneath them unless they continue to pay.

First, the concept of limiting screen time.
I didn't care much about screen time until my parents got this app. They restricted and paused things so much, that I felt controlled. I need screen time for things such as references for drawings. I also draw digitally, so restricting creativity isn’t helpful. Whenever I reference something, my anxiety says 📈📈stonks ✨ because I feel like I’m wasting screen time. It’s a nightmare, especially if your child is a teen or tween. I understand limits for younger kids, but teenagers? That’s a bit much. I get good grades (all 90s and above) and am generally a good kid, so I don’t understand why I need these restrictions. Most of us (teens) are fine if parents leave us alone instead of bugging us for things. When I’m left alone, I do my work more responsibly than when my parents are bothering me about it every second. It also tracks websites and stuff. It’s invasive.

Anyways, don’t download it. It’s not going to work.

Second, it’s just really buggy. I got time when it said bedtime, sometimes I wasn’t online and it restricted my time. Not worth it.";"2020-08-27T12:45:49-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1037062934&type=Purple%20Software";"1037062934";219;"en";"NEGATIVE"

As soon as I leave, my app says it can’t find my circle. This is very inconvenient as I can no longer make changes to the settings or give rewards when I am away from home. If I can’t figure out how to solve this problem, I will cancel my premium service and find another option for parental contros. ☹️";"2021-04-05T11:23:02-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1037062934&type=Purple%20Software";"1037062934";125;"en";"NEGATIVE"

In this day and age, experiencing a technical difficulty for several days is not acceptable. The should be offering refunds/credits to subscribers.

Prior to the premium service going down, this has been exactly what we were looking for. Reading the reviews from teenagers who are angry it exists is proof it works. We have a NetGear router that came with Circle integration.  Our speed has not been impacted in the slightest. Our oldest son is a gamer and he does not experience any lag. We ran speed tests between our current and old router, and even with Circle, the new router is actually faster (routers were fairly similar, we upgraded for Circle). We discussed the limits we were imposing with our kids when we set it up (bedtimes, age appropriate content filter, etc.). The only times our kids even know we have circle is when they are doing something that is against our family rules. If they are following the rules, it doesn’t have anything to block. When I was a teenager, I thought I knew it all too and I didn’t agree with the rules my parents had for me, but as an adult, I understand. If we don’t fight for our kids’ purity and equip them to chose to be self-controlled, this world will continue to devour their minds and creativity. In my opinion, Circle as surveillance is too far, but Circle is great for establishing and enforcing boundaries for screen time.";"2020-06-01T21:47:08-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1037062934&type=Purple%20Software";"1037062934";260;"en";"POSITIVE"

Circle won’t notify you.";"This app is a very useful free utility which I use peripheral to my Netgear RAX200. The product is set to be integrated with a smartphone and this app. Setup is easy with set by step graphic prompts and only takes minutes to set up eith several machines, enabling the ability to manage sets of internet connected device and even monitor the website usage of certain sets on age based contents. You can monitor / filter types of websites, control internet traffic to certain machines, and even set up time limits (which i still have try the last one.)

I am docking 2 stars because tracking and website filtering functions on the app abruptly stopped working. I went to their website and followed the initial steps to solve the problem and it didnt help - rebooting the router, reinstalling the software, etc. This didnt help. I contacted Circle’s customer service, and they said they couldnt help and directed me to contact Netgear. Netgear is meticulous in th help they give, but reaching them is hard and getting a case number in their systems is not quick. After 2 days of trial an error, it was determined that the app was not compatible with the 0.98 firmware update that I was initally required to install upon setup of my router. (Beware this update, RAX200 customers.) While this issue resta more with Netgear, Circle should have known this too and notified customers automatically to keep them informed.

So that’s why I docked 1 star. The second star I docked because of an experience that came up few days ago. I was having the same issue with website monitoring functionality going away. The app was acting up again, and to be clear, it was not tracking website history of machines I had setup to be observed and block online gaming from (on school days.) I went back to Circle’s  website to see if there was anything else I could do and did what i could at the time, delete and reinstall the app as advised. That was yesterday, and i had to wait this morning to follow up and reboot my router (because it was too busy on our WiFi for school, work, etc.) Upon rebooting, and around 15 or so minutes, the Circle App was working again. Becaue this second error happened, I questioned the stability of the app and looked for more information on the website. I had found that the problems I had overlapped with the timesc that 2 updates happened for the app for bug fixes. That is frustrsting to hear and I find should’ve been disclosed by the company. I feel Circle’s support system is lacking for the 1st Generation version of the app. Monitor updates when your app stops working.

But for those who want to see a formal review of this concept in the perspective of the child, keep reading. 

The idea of circle is understandable, as all parents should be concerned about what their children are doing online and should protect them from the horrible aspects that the internet can provide. But the fact that parents are spending their money on a network device that blocks out house WiFi (and cellular service) which they’re ALSO paying for is considered acceptable and convenient? I don’t see how this logically connects to every necessary part of the situation. 
I don’t see how I’ll be able to contact my parents during a serious emergency while on the go if my internet is paused.
I don’t see how I’ll be able to complete all my online school work if my parents have an “all categories” limit set to 3 hours(I’ve tried talking to them about that, they just give me a 15 minute reward over and over which wastes all of our time. Lots of parents are passive-aggressive like mine). 
I don’t see how the whole mechanism is going to work, if I’m spending my HARD EARNED money on cellular data, and they’re just gonna spend THEIR money to block it out. 
Yeah, the whole situation just wasn’t completely thought out by the developers. It is a brilliant idea to help protect children, but the whole thing just isn’t very convenient for the whole party. 
Also, circle just shouldn’t be necessary for kids older than the age of 16, since they’ll be a legal adult in just <2 years and they’ll have to figure out how to manage their own screen time by themselves eventually.

Parents, if you’re planning on getting yourself this network-killing device, please take a moment to look at yourself, how your relationship with your children will be, and if it’s going to be beneficial for EVERY part of their life(including online school!). Please be aware that your children will feel punished, and will cause trust issues between you guys. 
If your children have some screen time problems right now, I would deeply imply having a friendly conversation with them about it first before surprising them with a restriction right out of the blue. It’s like trying to quit smoking cold-turkey(not like they’re actually smoking, just take it as a simile). As a teenager who has experience with parents who ghostly put restrictions on me whenever they want without telling me, it’s a bit traumatizing. 
But, if you’re a good parent and your kids know it, and putting restrictions for them is necessary, and all your limits you provide them are fully thought out, 
OR, 
your children are just utterly psychotic and won’t get their eyes off a screen for less than 10 hours a day, then go ahead and get Circle.

But please, be careful. I’m saying this for the sake of the kids :c";"2021-08-14T18:36:10-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1037062934&type=Purple%20Software";"1037062934";512;"en";"POSITIVE"

Does not work well. Setup is difficulty. Detected devices show up with strange names. My two sons each have PS4 devices. In Circle they show up as ""Hon"". What the heck is that?? My Netgear app correctly identifies them as PS4s, so why can't circle? This makes setup very difficult when you're trying to identify devices. 
Issues after setup:
1. Circle will say my son has used three hours of Internet when he hadn't used any (was asleep). AND
2. For usage it will often just list numbers what look like IP addresses. When you click on the ""visit website"" link it doesn't work. So no way to know this supposed Internet usage. This is very common that you cannot know what the internet usage was. Isn't that the whole point of this tool?
3. Circle recently posted an article about how to avoid Circle using up Internet time for home schooling (quarantine). Didn't work as advertised. I marked specific sites as""unmanaged"", and those were A.  not supposed to count against Internet time limits and B. Not supposed to show up in history. Well, neither of those took place. ""Unmanaged""still counted against time limits and still showed up in usage history. 
4. For the past three days my premium paid features are all not working. Supposedly their engineers are aware of the problem, are working on it, but have no estimated fix date.

The MyCircle app also gives kids an app in which to monitor themselves.  I have only 2 complaints.  1) the monthly subscription of $5 beyond the $90 for the device and 2) for devices like the computer it only monitors the computer as a whole not each account on the computer.  So if a parent wants to use the computer they would be using the 'allotted' time given to the teenager.  True you can just change it to 'uncategorized' then change it back but that is not a smooth transition.  There are several areas which the company promises to improve but for my needs it works really well.  I do recommend this device/app for any parent that takes an active role in their child's online life.  This is in no way a parental replacement.

NO, I AM NOT A KID. Do NOT ASSUME something without ASKING. I am an adult. I only got it because I thought it would be helpful to shut off my internet at certain times and monitor how much time I spent online, because I was interested in keeping track. I never set it up to filter any content. I had no idea the app would act like this, even when I have it set to accept all content, and then I deleted the app, and it STILL filters. I could not delete my profile from the app itself, either, so I just deleted the app, thinking that would delete everything like it should have, but it didn’t. I am flummoxed and VERY annoyed!! 

I EXPECTED you to fix the problem I told you about, and not be a first class JERK about it. If you can’t HELP, please find another job. I hate it when people are so unhelpful and dismiss a review and write a stupid, rude and immature response that says only, “Kid review.” You should be ashamed of yourself for making an assumption like that. ASK FIRST before assuming next time! If you don’t want to help, find another colleague to help with my issue. I am sorry for being so darned annoyed, but your reply was very rude and unhelpful. How old are you yourself. 16? Your response was that of a teen and not a grown adult hired to help people with app problems.

1). As soon  as your kid gets a Chromebook from school you loose 100% of any control this product provides.  Schools often use a VPN to ensure control over safe browsing.  When this happens not only can do you lose control over app content (which I understand based on how VPNs work) but you also lose the ability to control screen time.  The kids run out of time on the phone or tablet and then just use the Chromebook since it can’t be managed.   Unlimited time. 

2). The kids are using all sorts off apps that aren’t identified in the filter.  When you go to “Usage” you’ll find the bulk of the time is in the “uncategorized” section with only an IP address to identify it.  A good example is Amino which is a community app with some really questionable content.  I’m sure most folks don’t know how to run a WHOIS command to track this down.  And even then it’s often uninformative.  Suggest Circle hires a couple folks to look at the top uncategorized sites and capture the content so we know the app that is associated to the IP address.  Many of these addresses now go to a company that builds/operates apps for their clients.   As such much of the information you would want from the app isn’t there.  As a parent you are left blind on the bulk of internet usage.    I hope the Product Manager for the app can prioritize something like this in the near term backlog.";"2019-01-20T15:37:43-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1037062934&type=Purple%20Software";"1037062934";270;"en";"POSITIVE"

So many things that can be harmful for them & it hard to constantly be up to date on everything. With phones, home computers, tablets, tv’s & video game consoles all having access to the internet. It’s impossible to constantly monitor what they are on especially as they get older. Also at the age where we have more kids hanging out or sleepover with phone. It helps me know when in my house there is some level of protection from them viewing things they aren’t ready for. 
We struggled with them following our time limits for video games. Which has now ended! 
I may be a mean parent, but I’ve read the research & I don’t allow mine on social media of any kind right now. There is plenty of rime for that when their brains are ready. Social Media is blocked!

If you just limit amounts of WiFi time, kids can still use their screens. Often, apps have an option to download content, allowing them to view it offline. Second, just limiting their time doesn’t teach them anything. My daughter just feels a need to not waste her time, making her go on more than she would naturally. I found a more effective way to teach my children life skills. When I feel they should take a break then I give them ideas of what to do, this helps them learn to be entertained in a different way. There should also be a partner app for the kids so they can monitor how much time they have and can use it wisely. Third, my kids often have schoolwork online, and who wants to waste WiFi time for fun stuff on homework. They often try to do it really quickly, skipping on quality. If i allow them to do their homework later they sometimes have already run out of time. The filter and tracking is the only thing i don’t hate, besides the fact that it is very glitchy and wrong. In the end this app isn’t to help you parent it lets you avoid parenting all together. A second partner app would be beneficial to allow kids to know how much time they have left.

 We have multiple devices of different makes and the filtering is pretty effective on all devices.

Assign devices to people in your household, create bedtimes, limits for apps and websites, filter based on age groupings, then tweak them based on what each person needs.

I can change restrictions on the fly, if the kid needs to stay up late to finish some homework, couple of taps and i move the bedtime back. 

Support has been fantastic, with fast response times, and clear help when needed, although honestly there wasn’t much help needed. The thing just plain works. It does its job (and more) quietly and elegantly. I only manage it as much as I want to. I can tweak the snot out of it, or just leave it be.

It does everything it's supposed to but there is a couple of tech issues with this app. The app will randomly restart as if you are setting it up new and requires you to make a new profile before you can see the current profiles already on the app. Then the other issue is with the circle go portion. It will say the device is deactivated when it is just connecting to a different wifi. Twice in the week we have had this the parent app says the vpn is disabled on the child device but when I check it is enabled. And only restarting the home router has fixed this issue.

Set-up was a pain.  For some reason this “PIN” they send to you didn’t work on my iPad and I couldn’t even get my iPhone to the screen to ask for it.

After a few resets of everything, I managed to get it working.  All in all, it took 30 minutes to just troubleshoot and get it working.  That didn’t include registration, etc.

Next, setting-up and using the app.  Once again ... fell short of even a good experience.  It is mediocre, at best.   The functionality is limited and everything is all about subscriptions.  Don’t get me wrong, I’m willing to pay for these, but not when they are still in the early days, like this app is.  Granted, I know this product should be well beyond its early days!   If I recall, it launched 1 1/2 years ago.   

Last, the fact that in this day and age, an app like this doesn’t work on an iPad in Portrait AND Landscape mode is inexcusable.   I can understand some other types of apps, but this is basic.   There’s nothing in this app that would make it complicated.   I would know, I build apps for a living.  

Sorry Circle & Disney, this product is still far from where it should be.  You could have apps on iOS to better inform users of their time up, you could have better screens.

Don't let a few negative reviews scare you.";"2016-05-06T21:21:34-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1037062934&type=Purple%20Software";"1037062934";74;"en";"POSITIVE"

Lost everything";"So this was a cute piece of hardware, promised some control and no subscription fees. And it was a semi-effective tracking tool for usage of electronics in our house. 

Then last weekend it wiped everything and rebooted.. now having to PAY for the services. It makes no sense. AND I lost all my settings!! Do you have any IDEA how many electronic devices are connected to the WiFi in a family of 6? It took me MONTHS to identify the devices based on the vague names, lump them into categories, set bedtime and screen time cutoffs for each. 

All gone without warning and now I have to pay monthly.";"2019-03-11T05:04:34-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1037062934&type=Purple%20Software";"1037062934";109;"en";"NEGATIVE"

They even go so far as to pretend to be adults or “network experts”. I am a relatively tech savvy adult and love this product. It is made quite well and simple to use, and gives great reporting on usage. I am sure it is not a perfect product, but when talking about privacy and security nothing is perfect.";"2019-01-22T05:43:34-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1037062934&type=Purple%20Software";"1037062934";82;"en";"POSITIVE"

Biggest ongoing problem is that occasionally the app loses connection to my Circle enabled router when I am away from my house.  At that point I lose control of the router and cannot reconnect until I get home.  For example right now I am away from my home for two days.  I turned off internet to my son’s devices for a while. The the Circle lost the connection. Now I can’t turn it back on until I get home tomorrow night.  This is a serious problem.";"2019-03-21T11:10:51-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1037062934&type=Purple%20Software";"1037062934";90;"en";"NEGATIVE"
