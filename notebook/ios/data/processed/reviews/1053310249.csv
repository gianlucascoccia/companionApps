The phone can be playing connected to iRoar via Bluetooth and playing music, but the app says not connected and won't work.  Also, volume on phone does not work properly with volume of iRoar.  Also, if the phone rings, receives an email, or just about anything, it resets the volume on iRoar and blasts the sound four times higher.  Finally, Bluetooth speakerphone functionality is very poor.
Bottom line, the speaker sounds great, but none of the app features work properly/reliably.  For the less money, get a similar Bose speaker and it works without the constant frustration of the iRoar.";"2016-07-04T13:08:51-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1053310249&type=Purple%20Software";"1053310249";105;"en";"POSITIVE"
