I was so excited to start using it but I was extremely disappointed and frustrated! The video quality is crap. And no it’s not my internet connection because it’s working perfectly fine on all our other wifi devices. The app keeps shutting down so we have to keep resetting the device almost everyday. I like that this home camera has white noise because my daughter can’t sleep without white noise. I always set the white noise nonstop whenever I put my daughter down for a nap or to bed at night. Since the app keeps shutting down the white noise goes too and guess who wakes up everytime the white noise turns off? My daughter! Sometimes the app stays on but the white noise turns off by itself even though I set it nonstop. Sometimes it turns on by itself I guess when it reboots I don’t know. Sadly, I can’t return this and get a refund since it was a final sale from Babies R Us when they were closing down last year. I don’t know if it’s the device or the app but they need to fix it because the device is not worth a penny! Please don’t buy this piece of crap unless Nokia or Withings fix the issues!

High marks for can appearance, size and a crisp wide angle lens which significantly exceeds the visual range and clarity of competing stationary cam products we have used. Plus the subtle and aesthetically pleasing camera housing prevents our home from looking like some type of NSA observation outpost to arriving guests which is also important! The cams are little pricy at first glance, but the added visual scope allowed us to reduce the number needed from 4 to just 2 which wound up saving us around $100.

When I first reviewed this I was frustrated because it took a bunch of reboots to get it working. After that first week or so, it started working really well & have had few problems since. The image quality, lights, & noise machine are great! I also like the 24 hr replay. The look is sleek & easy to adjust. It’s easy to turn on and off with the app too. I would love to see a rewind though: sometimes I hear a noise, grab my phone, and my son looks fast asleep. I’d like to see the 10 seconds or so before that. HUGE note to future users: if you don’t shut off cellular for the app, it gobbles up data like crazy. I only use on a WiFi connection now.

230;2452278058;"Scooter2u";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id133515396";"2.7.3";2;"Good cameras but glitchy software";"I have three cameras in my frail 85-year-old mom’s apartment so I can monitor her safety — especially during the hours when her paid caregivers are not present.  Glitchy software has me shopping for replacements.  Was really hoping that when Nokia bought out the original manufacturer, Whithings, things would improve fast. Have indeed seen some marginal improvements — but far fewer than I was hoping for. With each new app update I still have my fingers crossed (especially since these Whithings cameras cost twice as much as the competing models back when I first bought them at the Apple Store and then at Home Depot). 

PROS: Elegant camera design blends in gracefully with my mom’s decor and doesn’t make her feel like I have “spycams” everywhere.  Cameras are very easy to install and — in theory — very easy to monitor in my iphone.  Resolution, color, sound, and playback features are all quite useful. It’s great that you can add (and view) multiple cameras in multiple rooms. The nightvision, audio, air quality, and alert features all work just fine. 

CONS: My disappointment and frequent frustration are all due to the extemely glitchy and unreliable software.  Often when I first open the app the software says “your cameras are unavailable.”  Yet I have learned that simply rebooting the app once or twice usually fixes the problem. So, in fact, the cameras really ARE available...eventually. At other times only two out of three cameras function. But never the same two. 

Worst of all:  Even after all three cameras boot up the picture will often “freeze” for long periods of time completely. Sometimes switching to another camera “fixes” the freeze. But often not. Sometimes closing the app completely (ugh, yes, again) fixes this freeze problem too. And sometimes not. This is of course especially maddening if my mom’s health is especially fragile that night, such that I am truly relying on the camera system to monitor her every move carefully. 

FIXES:  Since I was a very “early adopter” I had to buy one more camera to replace the very first one I had purchased (which the company prior to Nokia, Whithings, flat out refused to replace). The darn thing just stopped working completely, and their tech help yielded no results even after many attempts. 

Next I upgraded the wifi speed in my mom’s hom thinking maybe that was the root of the problem. Now all other apps I run on my mom’s wifi — including streaming Netflix etc. — work flawlessly. But the darn Nokia cams Still Freeze Up or Fail to open at all just as frequently as ever. 

Then I decided maybe the download speed on my iphone and ipad at home was too slow. Yet here again I can stream whole movies on my iphone and ipad without any trouble at all — so why then are my (extremely expensive) Nokia Home Cams still freezing up and/or failing to connect on a regular basis?";"2018-04-21T20:49:14-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=936015067&type=Purple%20Software";"936015067";494;"en";"POSITIVE"

Why use it as a selling point and not bother to deliver on it?? These include temp and humidity, audio playback, video playback, none of which I've seen on the app. 

The home diary shows that you can click on an audio event to play back what ever audio triggered an alarm. That is not the case, right now it's just a time stamp showing you how long audio was heard and that's it. 

The motion detection is similarly ridiculous, it is simply a time lapse of several snap shots, hardly a video. More than a handful of the motion I intentionally triggered resulted in a time lapse video of nothing since it was either too slow or took pictures of when I was in and out of the video in too rapid of a succession. I set up the camera in my bedroom to try to catch my dog in the act of knocking the trash can down, it caught nothing since she did it so fast. The time lapse vid was two still photos long with the can knocked down for both pics.

Another annoying thing was that I had trouble going from full screen live mode back to the home diary view. You're suppose to be able to tap on the live view video a few times so it will minimize and go back, but most of the time it was just frustrating and would simply ignore the command. Maybe I had the gesture wrong since it seemed to work only about 60% of the time. 

Most importantly, within a 16 hour time frame, I had received online and offline triggers in rapid succession both while I was trying to view live video while I was at home and away, and also while the app was closed. It would go off and on just randomly while I know my home network is solid and has a very dependable high speed connection. 

On the same vein privacy mode would also go on and off with out me ever turning the wood cover to trigger it.

For 200$ Withings released such a poor product full of bugs and missing features that are all over their marketing material.

Overall, I was disappointed and returned it under 24 hours of receiving it in the mail.

The camera and the idea behind it is genius. But the buggy software, the frustrating customer support and the expensive subscription plans ruin the whole experience. 

First, the software. Since day 1 I have had audio problems coming from the Withings camera on my 6s+. The sound is always jarred and sounds like C3PO, you can't understand anything. It is not hardware related problem, because it plays fine on my iPad. 
The app crashes a lot on iPad Air when double-tapping to zoom in portrait orientation. 
There was a strange problem with auto night mode. When morning came, the camera live feed displayed everything colored in blue. Like there were 4-5 horrid blue Instagram filters stacked on. I barely managed to fix it by setting night mode to OFF one night and on the next day - to AUTO. 

Second, the customer support. 
For a company charging so much for home and health/fitness devices, you've gotta fix your website and email support. I've searched for hours how to contact customer support via email and how to send feedback about the Apple Watch app. 
When I finally was reached by email support, it took around 20 emails back and forth with days between them in waiting time in order for the 'specialist' to understand my issue and what I have did to troubleshoot. And let me say I'm not a noob, I have a significant software and hardware knowledge in almost every IT aspect.

Last, but not least, I want to express my sincere frustration from the 'service' Withings offers.
After charging 200 euro for a camera, they want additional 8/20 euro per month for video cloud recording. If you want ANY recorded video, you have to subscribe. The free basic plan offers ONLY GIF segments (for the last 2 days) when movement/sound is detected. The problem is that if a burglar enters your home, his face may or MAY NOT be recorded in the GIF segment with the basic plan. Let's say you are abroad, you don't have mobile data connection everywhere. Then you don't get notification that someone is robbing you. Therefore you can't alarm the police. When you get home on the next day your Withings camera may have recorded around 4-5 frames with the burglar and they almost definitely will not have caught the burglar's face. 
I know that cloud storage costs money, but does it cost that much as Whitings wants? Why not offering the basic plan with Dropbox/iCloud Drive support? I'm already paying Apple 3$/month for 200 GB. Whitings, why you want to charge me additional 8€/$ for a service which should have been free in the first place? I believe everyone expected this functionality to be free on the device out of the box.";"2015-11-09T13:18:20-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=936015067&type=Purple%20Software";"936015067";482;"en";"POSITIVE"

I don’t write reviews, and definitely not for apps, but I feel compelled to save another parent some headaches, not to mention the ridiculous amount of money I paid for two Withings home cameras to use as baby monitors. 

People - do not waste your money. Like another reviewer, I also had the terrible experience of the camera/app crapping out in the middle of the night and my child crying for who the hell knows how long.  Fast forward to now. I am sitting at my kitchen table, trying to catch up on work for oh, the past hour or so.  It’s 5am. Instead of getting ANYTHING done, I have been starting and restarting this crappy app, which continues to crash, with one ear out for a crying child. I’ve been googling, “crashing app” and related. I’ve been following all suggested steps...close app. Restart app. Check for updates to app. Check for updates to phone.  Restart phone. Delete app. Reinstall app.  Seriously - I don’t have time for this.  These developers clearly need to go back to the drawing board and do something different.

I always dread the software updates because it always seems to break more than it fixes.

We have had this product for about five months. We got it as a monitor for our, now 4 month old, baby. The device has never been dropped and has sat on an end table in her nursery since the day we bought it from Best Buy.

The problems have been unending...

1. The nightlight function doesn't work properly.

2. There's a short in the speaker of the device and it has stopped working right. You have to apply and keep pressure on the top of the device if you want to hear any sort of  sound from the built in speaker.

3. The device can't tell the difference between day and night anymore on the auto setting. So, we have to manually change it to day and night ourselves.

4. Our phones will frequently be alerted that there is noise, which is great. When our baby is crying it plays the audio and we can hear her. When she stops, the audio on our phones stop. That's awesome! Except when every once in a while the  audio doesn't stop on our phones and we have to go and unplug the device and plug it back in.

We bought this brand new from Best Buy and it was stupid expensive. We were fine with the price because we assumed  it would work as advertised and provide a great monitor situation for our new born. Unfortunately, this just hasn't been the case. Every day I wish I could have that money back and do something else.
