But I couldn't update it because the app doesn't do anything. Launch the app and all I get is the splash screen and it just sits there with nothing but the Koogeek logo. But I could still control the plug with Siri. Then after a few weeks, the smart plug stopped working entirely. So now it's just a big waste of money. I guess I'll throw the smart plug away and go back to using the light switch on the wall. That always works.";"2019-12-30T16:24:02-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1078204013&type=Purple%20Software";"1078204013";116;"en";"POSITIVE"

All are crap. I don’t know how this organization had the nerve to even bring these products to market. The lights switch was especially a disappointment and I had to call an electrician to set it up, because the wiring didn’t match up to my brand new built home. Every few months there’s a brief power outage in my neighborhood due to the new construction. Every time I have to go through the set up process again to make this function properly. There are times when there appears to be no power outage (clocks haven’t stopped their digital time) and the unit just suddenly stops working.

The more Koogeek items you own, the more you have to work to update firmware.  

I didn’t sign up to be a corporate adminstrator of tiny computers. 

You all need to bring this function to the front tabs (replace the product store) and have a shotgun “upgrade all Koogeek stuff” button.

Energy tracking is better then other switches I’ve had in the past and the switches themselves are pretty solid feeling and reasonably compact though still too big to fit 2 per outlet. I’d say so far they have been worth it.";"2019-02-02T16:34:11-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1078204013&type=Purple%20Software";"1078204013";87;"en";"POSITIVE"

I own 4 P2 outlets and about a week ago they stopped working with Alexa. Despite several calls to Amazon (who at least tried to help), Koogeek customer support is non-existent. They send emails saying sorry for the inconvenience, but offer useless assistance. Despite telling them, all procedures have been followed, including disconnecting and reconnecting hardware and apps, still nothing! Interestingly, it works flawlessly with Siri, but nothing with Alexa. I explained that it worked previously, but it was like talking to a wall. They just don’t get it!  Numerous folks are encountering the same issue, so in an effort to save those who are considering buying this product, GO ELSEWHERE!  I resorted to buying the Belkin WEMO mini to see if worked with Alexa...yes it did, no problems. I’m hoping this stinging review will convey a message to Koogeek... get your act together with Amazon if you expect people to buy your product!";"2018-07-06T16:18:33-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1078204013&type=Purple%20Software";"1078204013";176;"en";"POSITIVE"

I didn’t play with them for long but the one thing I did notice is the option where you can use a picture to create lighting scenes leaves a lot to desire. Whatever behind the scenes magic that’s used doesn’t smartly adjust each light to give off the variety of colors that may be in the picture. I attempted to use an evening sunset picture that had oranges,blues,yellows and red in it just didn’t capture the colors in the 4 lights I have installed. Hoping someone at Koogeek is working on improvements!!";"2017-09-22T05:40:54-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1078204013&type=Purple%20Software";"1078204013";102;"en";"POSITIVE"

Also, it would be nice if the reliability of the app were better considering I have had to reset the device already because the app would recognize the device but would not let me view in depth usage such as energy consumption. It would also be nice if the app would allow the device to fade in and fade out when turning on and off a lamp. Another suggestion would be to add the ability to set timers so a light could turn on and off at a specific time during the day.";"2017-08-18T01:26:44-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1078204013&type=Purple%20Software";"1078204013";135;"en";"POSITIVE"

If you're looking to control this over 4G, try setting up Apple's HomeKit to run (by setting up the device with the same iCloud account) on an iPad or Apple TV 3 or 4 that you have on the same network.
