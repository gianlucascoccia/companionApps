They are all directly Ethernet wired to the same Ethernet switch...they should have no trouble finding each other. I have set this system up now every day for the last week...which takes 10 minutes each time...because it loses the speakers every time you stop using the app. Every time. So the next time you fire up the app you need to reconfigure your whole system all over again...factory restarts of all three components and having the dialogue find the speakers again.  
If I could return them I would, but I bought them a few months back while building a house and now I am past the return window. I also have Sonos speakers and while they are inferior in sonic quality, the Sonos app works every time. Every time ... 
Devialet should stop putting R&D into more powerful speakers and just get the app right first.";"2016-10-13T19:32:00-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=964281562&type=Purple%20Software";"964281562";167;"en";"NEGATIVE"

I bought 2 Gold, 2 Silver and 2 Dialog. Every time I switched them off, I need to reconfigure the whole setup again. One Dialog died, while the other one keeps losing its configuration. Even as a single Bluetooth speaker, it keeps disconnecting every few minutes.

My Sonos back from 2004 plays every time with no hiccups. Same for the Apple HomePod, unlike this Devialet junk.

The Phantom manages to play, the music is clear cut above both Sonos and the HomePod. But it’s a hair pulling experience just getting them to work. In the end, I prefer to use the Sonos and the HomePod, with the Phantoms as decorative objects.

Devialet should stop bragging about having the best wireless speaker in the world and all their marketing mumbo jumbo. They can’t even get the basics right. Their software is a disaster and they seem to be pouring money in marketing instead of getting their system to work.

The number of times this app has told me to factory reset or to pull the plug for 10 seconds is unacceptable. 
About 1 in 50 times the app will actually go from 0-connected without any prompts, but when it does the connection is so weak that within 15 seconds it’s completely gone and you have to start over.

Why can't it support standards like Bluetooth or AirPlay?

The decision to play only through your own app means you have to produce a market leading music playing app, and this simply isn't. 
It's just too cumbersome to import a playlist into the app only to discover that some songs can't be played. It's simply a horribly ineffective interface.
