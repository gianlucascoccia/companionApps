But the plugins and the iOS app, plus an almost non-existent tech support, made me want to move away from Fibaro. The app is loading too slow, you can only have widgets for scenes, and some important modules don’t even show up. For example, it shows almost every unusefull info from a Qubino Power Meter, but it doesn’t show the most important thing: consumption. And it’s been like that for years...

Also, the notification system. For example now i have more than 10 notifications, that even show in the bubble over the app. But if i start the app, it shows me 0 notifications...

And the worst thing: it show different values than the web version of Fibaro. That’s very bad!";"2019-08-27T01:32:26-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=511085659&type=Purple%20Software";"511085659";136;"en";"POSITIVE"
