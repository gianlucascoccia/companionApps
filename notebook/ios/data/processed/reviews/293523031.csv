Especially impressed by your response to user feedback. There is zero chance of my buying a HomePod or whatever it’s called now. 

Archive this: Disappointing update people. I cannot understand how you’re getting 5 star reviews from anyone who’s used the controller for any length of time. First, and forgetting the UI’s appearance for a second, the move to privilege songs over albums is misguided. Choosing an album now gives me a mountain of icons for individual songs to choose from that album. It’s unclear how to just play an album or add an album to the queue with one click or a hard press as in prior versions. Also, the Rooms navigation is awful. There used to be immediate access at the top of the screen to individual rooms. Navigating to the list now, even with the button on the bottom is aggravating. It should always be available on screen. You have complicated the controller in many ways under the guise of simplifying the look of the interface. The interface is cleaner, yes, and I don’t mind the white as others do. What bugs me is that the cleanliness of the look destroyed the ease of use that was there up to now. I don’t want to fumble around relearning how to use the controller effectively. I just want to listen to music quickly and easily. I especially want to be able to play albums quickly and easily.

So we decided to move up to a LG 65” c8 television. Love it, but that’s another review. The Bose was great for music but was always problematic trying to get it working properly for surround sound. The Sony and Bose never really jived with each other. So as a result we seldom used it. Anyway, friends told me about Sonos speakers and since we had the new TV I decided to purchase the Beam sound bar, the sub woofer and two play 1 speakers to make a surround system for the new LG. Man it sounds great. We are very please with the system and the ease of setup and use. It is pricey when it comes to the sub woofer. However the sub really completes the system so I would say if you can swing it $$$, go for it. We chose the Beam over the larger Sonos sound bar because the Beam has a HDMI hook up with “ARC” and Alexa built in if that’s important to you. I just didn’t want a optical connection that the bigger Sonos bar only comes with. However I would guess the larger sound bar probably sounds better.??? However don’t let the size of the Sonos Beam fool you, it's impressive. Anyway I can’t wait to add more speakers to our house later on.

I have two Play:1 speakers that I use as a stereo pair. I was very disappointed when the v9.0 update, which apparently enabled Air Play on the One (plus other current models), disabled the home screen controls for those of us using the legacy speakers. I’ve also experienced the same as others where the last ~20 seconds of each track would be cut off when I was playing from a locked iOS device. I keep nearly all my audio on my iPhone & iPad and generally play straight from those devices’ libraries instead of from my Mac, as the latter spends most of its time in sleep mode.

Surprisingly I just accidentally got the lock screen controls re-enabled and the end-of-track cutoff seems to have gone away. For some reason one of my speakers dropped off the system and I couldn’t get it to reconnect, so I did a full-on controller reset on my iPhone. I also unplugged both speakers and then basically set my system back up, as if it was new. No idea why, but like I said this has caused the end-of-track dropout to go away and my lock screen controls to come back (even though Sonos says explicitly in their release notes that this function has gone away for those without Air Play compatible speakers).

Very weird, but now my system’s back to how I’ve used and loved it for the past 6-7 years and it’s great! Hopefully some others might try this and have some luck getting full functionality back.";"2018-09-01T09:59:42-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=293523031&type=Purple%20Software";"293523031";264;"en";"POSITIVE"

I have also accumulated a library of thousands of titles, expecting to listen to my purchased music via Sonos, a functionality that made the hardware investment worthwhile.  On the positive side, Sonos has gradually solved most of the bugs that would inexplicably fail to connect or randomly break connection with my WiFi or with my iphone.  But the unwelcome news that Sonos would cease to play titles “on this phone” felt like a real ripoff - a classic bait and switch.  It is redundant and wasteful to pay dues to a music streaming service when I already “own” the music I want to hear.  Had I known that Sonos would block me from listening to my own music, I would never have invested in the system.  This is why, when friends ask me whether they should buy Sonos, I now recommend rather that they purchase a set of high end Bluetooth speakers.  I will be surprised if the good folks at Sonos publish this review, as it is anything but the hands-down accolade I’m sure they would prefer.  But if they are serious about building consumer loyalty and serving and growing their customer base, they will thank their subscribers for their invaluable feedback and reinstate the “on this phone” functionality.";"2020-04-14T19:03:09-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=293523031&type=Purple%20Software";"293523031";227;"en";"POSITIVE"

I do not find it intuitive and still struggle to figure out how to pick music to play in a particular room. Also, My favorites used to scroll vertically, making them easy to sort through as I could see many of them on the screen at the same time. Now they scroll horizontally and have huge icons, meaning I can only see one station at a time.  This app used to be 5star worth and set it apart from the crowd. 

Original review:
I seem to keep finding reasons to expand my system, it gets pretty addictive.  I mostly use Pandora or other internet radio type stations. Streaming music to a speaker via Bluetooth is not the same!  The speakers are more like today's smart TV's, with apps built in that run autonomously, the phone is just a remote control.  Software navigation is incredibly easy and the speakers all sound amazing! I have a Play 1 in both my bedroom and home office, a Play 5 in my living room, a Playbar/Sub/Play1 surround system hooked to my Sony Bravia TV in the family room, and am waiting on a connect amp to arrive for my outdoor speakers.  They can all play different stations, or group them together as needed during house parties.";"2017-10-14T10:31:31-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=293523031&type=Purple%20Software";"293523031";222;"en";"POSITIVE"

Original Review: I'm split on this review, obviously. It's tempting to defiantly throw up a 1-star review and walk away without explanation but that would be unfair to a product that really is a standout. I've been a Sonos evangelist for years and years. The system has always been rock solid and the app intuitive -- flawless hardware and software. That all changed with the latest major version of the app. It's so confounding to those of us that have loved this product for years.  I don't care that it's white -- stupid quibble. People can get over that. But the actual interactions I have with it while trying to play music in different rooms never seem to get easier. I eventually get what I want but it's not before cursing the new app several times for tricking me into the wrong area. 

I want so badly for Sonos to acknowledge their error and revert to the older-style navigation. It would be an easy 5-star review from me again.";"2018-05-11T08:24:27-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=293523031&type=Purple%20Software";"293523031";207;"en";"POSITIVE"

It just so happens that Sonos doesn’t have tech support available on the weekends to assist when the average human is needing it. I’m disappointed at the fact that I thought it would be a nice touch to bring the speaker to a bridal shower at a friends house for entertainment purposes. Connected it to the WiFi at her house, finally got everything setup and then couldn’t even use it because the speaker couldn’t just link to pandora without having my password. I couldn’t remember it to save my life. So I get it home the next day, and try to re-setup the speaker on the network in my house, thinking that this wouldn’t be so difficult according to the instruction video in the app/controller. I’ve unplugged the speaker, the router, plugged the Ethernet cable into a wireless router and the Internet box directly from the ISP, and nothing will work to have the speaker setup on my own network. The app/Controller instructs you to plug the Ethernet cable up and then wait for the mysterious green light that never comes on or to go to advanced settings which doesn’t appear anywhere in the app, or my personal favorite when the app tells you to select the SONOS wireless network that doesn’t appear. So lesson learned don’t take your Sonos anywhere and set it up unless you plan to leave it there!!! Because you won’t be able to set it up anywhere else!!!";"2018-08-12T11:49:59-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=293523031&type=Purple%20Software";"293523031";262;"en";"POSITIVE"

It’s about the app, which needs some work. The ability to access multiple audio sources is great. What it is missing though are the small details that make the apps from those services it is drawing from a better option almost every time. For instance, the Pandora app lets you view songs that have already played - so, if you were away from the device and heard a new song and want to know more about it, you could check later to see what it was. With the Sonos app, if you don’t check while the song is playing you will never know. With the Books from Audible, it’s great that you can play it in multiple rooms but losing the ability to speed up the playback means I won’t use that service here. The same (or worse) with Apple podcasts. The only way to access them is via the On This Phone option. Unfortunately, it doesn’t tap into the organization that the iPhone uses and just puts everything out there in a mess so if you have multiple episodes to listen to, it’s just a huge mess. This also needs the speed up option that the regular podcast apps offer. Again, I love my speakers and the music I play on them sounds amazing. However, I really hope the app gets some good upgrades soon.";"2019-04-04T19:34:34-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=293523031&type=Purple%20Software";"293523031";243;"en";"POSITIVE"

For the past 6 years since we’ve gotten our first speaker, the sound bar, we have been very pleased with our (expensive, yet) great quality speakers. They will cut out every now and then, most noticeable during movies, but that was only a slight annoyance compared to what we are dealing with now. Perhaps it is part of a new update (we have the latest version, so the app being outdated should not be an issue), or simply the app crashing, meaning it will be back up and running within a week hopefully. But, since this morning, Sonos has let us down. An overall irritation, disappointment, and not what we paid for! The speakers (rooms) have been unable to group, and some speakers are silent, despite the loud volume it is set on (they are also all plugged in). We could select a song or artist or radio to play, but the speaker will simply not react whatsoever. Being a loyal patron of Sonos, my family and I are frustrated and hope this issue is resolved quickly, especially with the holidays. 

      But to those interested in purchasing one or more Sonos speakers, they have overall been a great investment for our family. We have been spoiled with these great speakers scattered around the house, making it so that when they suddenly fail to do what they are supposed to, it is especially aggravating.";"2018-12-16T13:31:54-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=293523031&type=Purple%20Software";"293523031";255;"en";"POSITIVE"

My two dozen speakers are used at my home, office and vacation home.  Until now I have had ZERO complaints- only praise! In fact, I have encouraged my friends and family to buy Sonos and given the speakers as gifts - until now.  
The new interface is non intuitive and confusing.  Actually, it is COUNTER INTUITIVE. My friends, family and office staff have turned against me for providing them a monster of a music system.   I am now the one asked to tune in the music that they desire because no one can figure it out (or don’t have the time to try to figure it out).  Then I embarrassingly struggle to fulfill their request, and screw it up anyway. 
However, not all hope is lost!  Sonos, if you want me to give you the five stars that you really deserve, fire the individual in charge of this most recent downgrade. Please post a photo of them exiting the building carrying their personal items in a cardboard box.  
Then get the app back to the way it was, with a few interface tweaks that are intuitive.

High quality speakers thought your home is a game changer. The app on the other hand, could use some renovation. If you search for a popular artists name to find a specific album, you’ll be greeted with a cluster of disorganized censored albums, uncensored albums, song singles, and song features. Nothing is organized by year or date. It would be nice to be able to click an album, then have a toggle button that changes it from censored to uncensored. It would make things more user friendly. My second recommendation would be about the layout. For such a smooth speaker product line, the app seems really square and blocky. Lastly, a touch of Dark mode to make the inter interface black might just be a personal preference, however we’ve all seen the success Apple has had implementing a dark mode for their devices. It’s more pleasing on the eyes and would also make the entire app look like the logo. Again, I love the speakers, however when it takes me more than 3 minutes to find a single song (in this world of instant gratification) it doesn’t make me too happy.";"2020-02-15T04:15:05-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=293523031&type=Purple%20Software";"293523031";208;"en";"POSITIVE"

 Update: one of my favorite features is that Sonos can almost never process any command without restarting the app. And even more fun, the play/pause button is unreliable after it restarts. It may be playing but only offer “play,” or it may be paused and only offer “pause.”  Leaving the house and want to turn off the music on the way out the door?  Better sit down, maybe pour a drink. I left the music on all night recently because of this. I left convinced that it was off after at least a minute of toggling and waiting. Silly me. One must, I guess, use multiple devices to verify that a simple “pause” command was evaluated correctly. 

Another great feature is the frequency of updates. I wish the updates would fix the problems, but they only seem to compound them. The annoying update notification inevitably lists something I don’t care about and then breaks some basic functionality. Whom exactly are you catering to, Sonos?  Your customers?  Someone else?  What gives?  Great, now Sonos works with all this stuff I don’t have or even want, but can’t manage any single task without a complete restart. You are optimizing for the wrong priorities.

And now they’re going to disable the Sonos remote that I own because apparently they own it. I was a Sonos fan from the beginning but no more.

Update: Sonos has lost their way. With each successive release of the software more features are removed. I used to be able to see Sonos on my lock screen and adjust the volume. No more. (Yes I’ve seen the remarks about having other audio programs open which I closed although I didn’t have to do this before.) I used to be able to open the app and adjust the volume with the hardware buttons but now they’re stupid buttons and need to be pressed multiple times before they recognize they’ve been pressed. Changing rooms, overly complicated now. If you’re on the fence about buying a Sonos system I recommend that you don’t do it.

1) It does not sync perfectly with the music library on the device from which you’re operating it from; for example, I tend to use my iPad Pro with my ENTIRE music library on the device in iTunes, yet there are several songs that cannot be found through the Sonos app, and after spending several hours and multiple calls to Sonos tech support they blame iTunes and threw their hands up. The music is clearly on my device yet the Sonos app can’t “see” all of the music “on this device”, very frustrating!
2) Often when we go to use the Sonos app on any of our devices (2 iPhones and 1 iPad) it cannot connect to the network and will not come up on the device, suggesting that you reboot the router.  This is a hassle and inconvenience, and it happens about 50% of the time.

I usually pop in my AirPods and watch a quick video on FB or FaceTime and the music still plays. This is probably my favorite feature. I have no regrets and I’m sure it only gets better from here.

Long story short, these components provide excellent audio quality at a nice price and are modular so a guy on a budget can add pieces little by little. Pure audiophiles may snub their noses at these, but the increasing quality of audio sources make these an excellent choice for any room, situation and budget.

That’s the price we pay I guess, for the luxury of having some of the best sounding speakers on the market. 

This app has multiple functions beyond just controlling your music. It’s also the tool used for calibrating your speakers and adding new ones to the ecosystem. It handles these tasks fairly well. When it comes to navigating your music, it’s just... okay. I can fairly simply choose to play different music in different rooms, which is cool. However I noticed I regularly just end up using AirPlay instead of the app; all because the search functionality is just awful. 

I could go into iOS music app, search for an artist, and be delivered literally everything I want from that artist. If I do the same in this Sonos app, I often scroll until I get so frustrated not being a old to find a song or album I want that I just end up going back to AirPlay again through the iOS music app. Same frustrations go for every style of search, be it album, song, playlist... the Sonos app very rarely offers me the music I want to hear from a simple search.";"2020-02-01T10:41:43-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=293523031&type=Purple%20Software";"293523031";210;"en";"POSITIVE"

On this aspect alone I would contribute five stars.

The rub, however, is in the application. While, for the most part, the app/SonosNet interface and communication work well, there are irritating moments of dysfunction. The problem that I most often encounter is that the app will fail to communicate with the speakers for intermittent periods of time during which I cannot remotely control the components of my system. Less often, but proportionally more irritating, is when the sound from my Sonos Connect (which I use to port my home theatre into the SonosNet) will drop out repeatedly during a Netflix binge.

1. I add the songs from my Apple Recently Added playlist to “My Sonos” for alleged easy access. But I don’t have the option to play the music as a playlist. Navigation is My Sonos> (Recently Added) Record Cover>Play. It should be My Sonos> Recently Added> (Option to) Play or Shuffle. Compilations should also be treated like a playlist. Where’s the convenience in navigating back to a list to play each song? Why do I have to add each song to a Sonos Playlist when it already exists as a list?!?

2. I get a 1002 error message anytime I select “play” from my Apple/My Music/Songs list or directly click on a song from that list.

Tried everything including a two hour “support” session with Sonos. Nothing but an admission that AirPlay is “hard to implement AND yet maintain control over the data”. I know it’s getting old to complain about but the insatiable business model focused more on how to monetize users and user’s data than simply developing a good product is getting ridiculous and it’s preventing consumers from getting what they expect and pay for.

AirPlay 2 support for Airport Express is going to really hurt Sonos if they don't get this figured out quick! I just dusted off a few I had laying about.

But in the last year, the honeymoon came to an end.  Somewhere in the all too frequent annoying deluge of upgrades they shove at you, playback from my iPhone became problematic with frequent skips (reminiscent of my vinyl days) and queues that stop playing. After contacting Sonos they provided a work around (turn off the auto off feature on your iPhone) that worked for awhile. Now they’re removing the playback feature from your iPhone and have proposed some other (more complicated) work arounds which have so far proved unsatisfactory (their desktop controller failed to incorporate my entire music library).  
My question is with all the apps being developed for an iPhone and iOS, why can’t Sonos get their $&@ act together and get something that’s simple and works flawlessly.

Major podcasts with hundreds of thousands or even millions of users are not available through the Sonos search feature, and they’ve been added to the “My Radio Shows” section, which is somehow confusingly distinct from the “Podcasts” section.

The controller app works well but I am a tech person so easily understand some of the nuances to the features. My wife can use it well enough to play her favorites as well. I will note that as more features are added to the controller app, it gets more complicated and those technically challenged don't find it as easy to navigate the controls. Great products though and the sound can be perfectly matched to any room. 
One issue I discovered is that SiriusXM limits the number of simultaneous streams so if you are trying to play a channel in multiple rooms you will get a message cutting off the stream.

This would be so bad if they didn’t lock the app and force you to upgrade their app to play songs through the software. 

 I’ve had the product for about 2 and a half years. When I first purchased it I could play songs on my speakers. I could even play the songs I had purchased and downloaded to my device from iTunes. Now slowly but surely, with each forced update to their software, that is required to use the speakers I’ve bought and paid for, they have whittled down the sources from where you can play music. These updates have also added “features” that cause the app to stop playing music to the correct speaker, stop play music at the correct volume, or just stop playing music all together. All thanks to the glorious mandated software and it’s many forced updates. I basically have four $500 paper weights now.

I was originally going to wait on writing a review until after they released their fix for burying the alarms, but now that it’s out the new “shortcut” to alarms is still just as convoluted. The frustrating part is that on the settings page where alarms used to be, half of the page is blank and what is there are 7 sections that are rarely used if at all (like legal), and this wouldn’t be too big of an issue if the settings page wasn’t automatically the one page that pops up every time you open the app. If they don’t want to put alarms on the front page of settings that’s fine but at least let me change the “home page” of the app allowing it to open on the rooms page whenever I launch the app so that way I have access to the only 2 features I use more than once a year... music & alarms.";"2020-01-08T23:38:08-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=293523031&type=Purple%20Software";"293523031";213;"en";"NEGATIVE"

If you want an integrated wireless hifi system for your house that actually works, and supports all the major streaming/storage providers it’s the only game in town. 

The controller app, however, is a rolling disaster that manages to keep getting worse with each subsequent redesign. The latest major update apes the design of the iOS music app but it’s just an impossibly poor fit: there are two separate “room” interfaces and you will always, inevitably, pick the wrong one for the action you want to do. Volume controls are hidden in a slide-up “now playing” card which, when expanded, hides the shortcut links to everything.  Getting simple things done is like swimming through molasses: someone at Sonos needs to sit down and do some actual user testing for this stuff. 

The good news is that they’ve mostly ignored the OS X/windows controller applications, so the interface there is still actually usable.

UPDATE:  it has taken a little while to get used to the new UI. I will also say the the new version was a lot more temperamental with Google Wifi - because the four speakers were reaching different access points it was hit and miss.

Oh yeah and the icing on the cake is that you won’t learn that TruePlay doesn’t work on your iPhone X until you have completed the entire process and it freezes indefinitely on the last step.  Since SONOS knows this doesn’t work (I learned about it when I tried to find info in their forums...and there is info about this) it would be kind of nice if they popped up a warning at the START of the process to let you know you can’t do it on your particular hardware.

The latest update made it more cumbersome. Why oh why did you move the alarm control in the latest update?!?! The former tab “more” on the far right made so much more sense than “settings” because there’s a lot more than settings under it (pun intended). Now to find the alarm function you have to go to settings->system-> and scroll way down to alarms. For someone that uses 2 of these speakers as morning alarms for my kids and frequently turns the alarms on or off and makes adjustments this is SUCH A HASSLE. After the update I struggled to find the alarm in the first place because it’s so NOT intuitive. Initially I thought the alarm control was deleted. 

The Alarm control is a major feature for many people using these speakers and it should be in an intuitive and convenient location. Please move the Alarm control back to an easily accessed place that doesn’t require several taps and scrolling down to find it!

My opinion is almost every size room needs at least a Sonos three if not a Sonos five. And by all means get a pair for each room unless the room is really small. The stereo separation and sound quality is so much better. 

What keeps me from giving a five out of five rating is there still are several bugs that occur weekly. Music will stop at random times,  speakers will ungroup, and music will stop mid-song and start randomly sampling several songs before settling down and playing one all the way through.

Sure, there are cosmetic issues like the bright white background, but more serious is the new navigation and UI. Why did they have to move Sonos Favorites to a different place than the Pandora and Sirius Favorites? Why did they have to remove the little play/pause icon from each of the Favorite channel logos? Now, while you're looking at your favorite channels, you can't tell which channel is playing unless you go to the now playing page.... so stupid. Also, previously there was always a little arrow at the top left of the screen where all your music could be accessed. Now, on some screens it's there, but on some other screens you have to go to the bottom toolbar to access your music. Why separate the music that way?

The sound is quite good and its several autonomous modular options allow flexibility of delivery.  Stereo is readily achievable by pairing modular units. 
Occasional software updates can slow things up a bit.  At times the system seems to forget where it is and asks me to start from scratch. I don’t like passwords and find it unnecessary for something like Sonos.  I know the trend will be to have AI invading our homes so I hope Sonos has an opt out feature to allow those of us not interested in being spied on to have a simple server in the house and have to endure the vagaries of AI second guessing our every decision regarding the simplest of pleasures.";"2018-07-25T05:11:32-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=293523031&type=Purple%20Software";"293523031";170;"en";"POSITIVE"

Two annoyances though: 1) When choosing to cast through Sonos a song already playing in the Pandora app, it automatically censors the lyrics. It’s impressive technology, but there doesn’t seem to be a way to opt for uncensored casting. Reviewing comments, it seems both companies are blaming each other for it. Couldn’t that option pop up right as you’re choosing to throw it out to Sonos? Not all of us have kids or customers within earshot. 2) Late last baseball season, I discovered I could stream audio of MLB games on Sonos through the partnership with MLB’s At Bat app. This year, I get a message saying Sonos isn’t partnering with MLB anymore. So, only 4 stars. I’d planned this season to buy speakers for more rooms to  FEEL baseball games throughout the house, but without that option, I’m ok with just the one speaker for music & podcasts.";"2018-06-02T17:41:38-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=293523031&type=Purple%20Software";"293523031";162;"en";"POSITIVE"

I have had the system in my whole house for approximately 3 years and loved it. Then about a year ago, when playing songs from the I phone, the songs would randomly skip in the middle of one song & start playing another song. Other times it would just go silent even though the controller shows that the song is playing. SONOS is well aware of the problem (that was never a problem when I first bought the system for the whole house). The SONOS tech people blame APPLE (who actually sells the system in their stores).

Previous Review: The speakers work and sound great. Connects to my massive Apple Music iCloud Music Library just fine, even though it takes a while to sync my latest additions. iTunes changed the names of the Apple Music tabs quite a while ago, but this app still has the old titles. My pet peeves are that it does not know how to ignore ""The"" when listing alphabetically, and the ""Albums"" listing is not by artist.

I enjoy the variety of classical music I can stream through tunein radio as well as good jazz through Jazz 24.  I recently returned from a trip to the Netherlands and have been able to listen to a radio station we heard while there. Ditto, classical stations from New York and Chicago.  Because of compression, the sound is not as dynamic and involving as an FM signal, but it does lack the interference associated with such signals. An OK trade off.

The Sonos systems I use have been reliable and easy to navigate.  I occasionally am not able to stream a local classical station, but suspect the problem is on their end---not Sonos's.
 
I've not been able to successfully use the ""line in"" feature to play music through my surround system from my CD player---unacceptable drop outs and low sound quality due to inability of surround system to handle an uncompressed source.

Also, even if you don’t close the app, after 5 minutes it automatically departs from the song playlist you are playing in favor of the main screen. So you have to go through all of the steps to get back into the playlist area and find it just to see the playlist itself. Why?

So I have 4 wifi names at my house and for some reason, Sonia now only connects to one of my names. This was not an issue previously so please fix this!!!!!!

October 2017 update - another update from Sonos on the App- actually makes switching rooms more difficult and also finding my favorites harder to find.   Sonos makes a GREAT product (actually products) but sometimes, they go overboard in trying to have the perfect app and now have made it more confusing.  How I long for the design of 1 year ago.  Please please please.";"2017-10-16T18:49:22-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=293523031&type=Purple%20Software";"293523031";231;"en";"POSITIVE"

It is hard to find the most simplistic things (favorite stations, alarms, really just about everything).  You should also be able to move things/prioritize them (favorites/rooms) for quick reference when you need them.  First, Sonos should fire the brother-in-law(s) writing the software updates (they can go writing security software for the credit rating agencies); second, go back two to three iterations on the software’s physical interface, finally, allow me to place two more Play Ones in the front channel of my video surround (hey, with an 80” screen, the Playbar is a bit anemic...).

Either it can’t connect and needs to be restarted or it will start to play and if the phone closes I’ll have to close the app out and restart it. I’m getting the white screen of death when I open the app. It just sits there and says can’t connect.

Update to my review: We moved the Sonos/Alexa unit to a room closer to our WiFi router.  The signal is much improved and so is the reliability of the connection.  However, the unit acts like it’s “hard of hearing”. LOL! We have to use a louder, deeper voice tone to get a response to play a radio station or Pandora.

It’s incredibly aggravating that I can’t use the best speaker in my collection when I want to listen to music around my house.

My ear is not that tuned and therefore it is not a concern for me. Certainly the ability to stream almost any song ever recorded makes up for any inefficiencies the system may have at this time.

This is not a network connection issue and this is not a hardware issue, as the other Sonos sound sources play just fine without any interference for hours of use.

Sonos is more interested on providing a music service via their APP. They continuously update their firmware and APP interface to keep up with the latest computer and mobile technology. It all sounds good huh...

Well here is the problem. Early Sonos customers will eventually not be able to play their music from their favorite playlist or Steaming service of its not entered into an agreement with Sonos to be on their APP. Thus eventually you will end up being phased out and thus your speakers will be obsolete and of no use to you. Unless of course if you go and purchase new hardware to keep up with their firmware updates they force you to download to your device.  Every time you end up downloading a update you are gambling that your device will be able to handle it.  If not you are SOL 

They are more interested in you buying the speakers to have you locked into their Sonos APP service, where think they are Making their money. 

A true WiFi speaker will allow you to play your music from any computer or mobile device, regardless of how old your WiFi  operating and hardware systems are. 

Bottom line they are a WiFi music service and not a true WiFi speaker company that will allow you to steam music from any steaming app or music you have already purchased.";"2019-11-23T15:27:26-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=293523031&type=Purple%20Software";"293523031";242;"en";"POSITIVE"

The problems with the latest “upgrade” are manifest not at the technical level but in the woeful interface.

Being able to play music stored on your phone is such a basic, fundamental feature of any music player app that the fact that they’d even entertain the idea of removing it is laughable. Sure you can still stream music from Apple/Amazon/Spotify or your computer, but you shouldn’t be limited to those options. It would be extremely inconvenient to lose this functionality. 

Sonos should take the time to make the necessary architecture changes to keep this feature rather than simply removing it altogether.

“We first launched the 'On this iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch' feature in 2012 as an option to play locally stored audio content on Sonos. The way this feature was originally architected has become unreliable with newer versions of iOS.

Sonos is the best value for the quality. You would have to spend significant dollars with a high-end system to realize any significant gain in performance.  The app and controls are second to none. FYI - You can sync via their app to the most common music storage accounts such as iTunes, etc. 

Summary is best explained via compare and contrast of another technology that is similar in cost breakdown. Do you know optics such as binoculars, scopes, etc.? If you do, you know Leupold is the best value mid range up to the low high-end with a fair price. You have to spend $2k or more to realize the best with Swvorski type products. Same here.

I’m a competent tech person...not an expert by any means...but I learn and navigate all apps without assistance. Not this one, though. It is frustrating beyond belief. It is the WORST!

At first I appreciated the app’s clean look. That lasted until I needed to troubleshoot our system which happened at breakneck speed. Then I realized how very little explanation and help screens there really are. What is there is overly-simplified and the most basic of instructions. I will have to call our A/V professionals back out because apparently sharing useful information on this app is too much to ask. 

Even as I’m typing this, my husband is screaming he cannot get sound from the TV on a Playbar using the app. My husband is beyond frustrated and I am so regretting I didn’t check out these reviews to see all the unhappy customers complaining about this version of the Sonos app before I spent all the money on the hardware.

The Sonos app is also just not intuitive. I use it every day, and it still takes me a bunch of clicks to find the current queue. In conclusion: good, not great.

Second: when scrolling through the artists view within the Apple Music section, there used to be the sidebar to the right with the alphabet that could be used to quickly jump to a certain letter in the alphabet. That has been gone for some time now and makes it extremely inconvenient to find a particular artist when you have a huge Apple Music library like I do.

It seems that the good reviews are from new users and about the quality of the speakers. The speakers are fantastic and if you haven’t been a long time user, you might not realize that this update is a real step back for the UI of Sonos.

The new workflows for getting anything done are very unintuitive and less efficient than they used to be.

To give a user case, consider putting music on in Bedroom while you are listening to music in Living Room. You need at least 5 touches!
- tap the disclosure triangle on the Now playing screen to reveal the lower menu bar
- tap Rooms in the menu bar
- tap Bedroom
- tap Browse or My Sonos in the menu bar
- select your music, which will take at least one tap

This kind of workflow was effortless in the old app taking just a few taps.

This is just one example; other longtime users have written about other issues with the new app. I hope Sonos reads these reviews and reassesses the decisions they have made in order to regain the simplicity and efficiency of the old version.

==================================
Prior review 

Please fix this new update.  I feel lost without my music or my tv sound through Sonos.  The new app update disabled the speakers.  All three of my Sonos products are just blinking white.   Neither the iPhone app or Mac app work to control the speakers.

Speakers can not be found through either the iPhone app or Mac app.  The app is asking to set up a new system.  I do not want to set up a new system, when I did that in the past, setting up a new system, wipes all my favorites, all my stream stations and their account info (user names and passwords).  I can not risk that again.  I would like to speak with Sonos tech support.  Unfortunately I will need to wait until Monday.

Starting October 1, 2016, Sonos has ended all WEEKEND phone tech support.  We have layed out a lot of money for Sonos and can not use it now.  They should not force an app update without checking to make sure it works.

The app doesn't collect metadata like when a song is installed, how many times it has been played, or when it was last played, so dynamic playlists are impossible.
  The primary use for me is extending my speakers wirelessly. The easiest way to do this is to use the app's player, but since the app doesn't have dynamic metadata this isn't really viable. I have to use the line-in port to connect an external player. This is an analog port, so it has to go through a sampling and compression stage, which introduces latency and random wifi dropouts.

Those older products happened to be mainly the ones that required a Sonos amp and used built-in third party speakers. 

Sonos was trying to push consumers to their newer all-in-one amp/speaker combinations. We do have several of those, and they work fine. However, we really resented them forcing an upgrade on us.

You only have to look at Sonos’ website to note they are charging a premium price for their products. At these prices, you should be able to expect 15-20 year product life in my view.

Sonos eventually caved to angry consumer demand last year, but the app has started to get VERY balky with the first generation products. I’m not techy enough to figure it out in fact, but it certainly feels that the first generation products are being slowly neglected.

Sonos now supports almost every premium music service and Internet Radio. Add a Sonos Connect and you can add any legacy component like a tuner or turntable and instantly they join the system.

Sonos’ lack of ability to support legacy devices is a concern both economically and enviornmentally. That’s well reported on the internet. Who wants to invest in expensive speakers that become obsolete in a few years with no major performance upgrades” 

The other big problem I have with Sonos is that they no longer allow you to play specific media from the controlling device. One of the great pleasures I enjoyed was having friends play music from THEIR phones when they visited. It is also a real pain to have to stream content when you are in a remote area with limited access.

About a year ago went through several submissions with Sonos tech support. They helped once by pointing out that the router and Sonos must be on different channels. Several times the tech support tried to tell me there were issues with AC power lines in the walls near the speakers. And other electronic devices nearby - none were close. And remember things worked fine for years. And work fine after software updates. 

Biggest help was when Sonos releases updated software. Can usually tell an update is coming when problems start again and are not fixable.

So I am very familiar with their offerings and have been happy until today. 

I was going to upgrade my Playbar to the ARC but not anymore. Sonos decided to make all my current Sonos obsolete and came out with this new app. No longer supporting these “old” devices in unacceptable when you pay a premium for Sonos. The new app icon looks depressing (grey and small font), the wording under the app is too long and is crammed together. All they needed to do is name it Sonos S1 and keep the app icon black and bold. 

As far as future updates.... I understand technology becomes obsolete but saying anything after May 2020 is obsolete is a JOKE!!!! Heck at least Apple iPhones receive updates on 5 year old devices.

With this latest update, I’m finding my Sonos system is unstable, with the app crashing / becoming unresponsive.

I’ve even hard wired as my as my Sonos devices as possible.

With the most recent update, Sonos has now introduced feature equivalency between their own handheld controller and the iPhone app. Most important addition is the control of Windows Media Player streaming music libraries - a feature that was sadly missing from the first version of the app - great to have it now added!

In my system I have three Play 1s, three Play3s and a PlayBar. Sonos software design has always been poorly designed but I used to be able to play songs directly from my iPhone library but not anymore. The computer app also has lost functionality which is completely unacceptable.
The speakers I invested over  $2,500 in are no longer functional with the updated system.
Sonos “offers” the old “S1” system software in the App store but in reality it only prompts you to upgrade to S2 without ever connecting you to your speakers.

Having to control my music/content through the Sonos app is a little bit of a hassle. In short, it often adds a couple more taps/clicks to get to the content than if I simply played it on my phone or through a Bluetooth speaker.

If you change anything you're in for some frustration. . .
Setup is a bit tedious to begin with, but f you change anything, you're in for some frustration.  It's so ""easy"" to set up, you can't change anything once it's worked before.  You need to add shares from your desk-or-laptop in order to get ""your"" music.  Also, even though The Playbar costs a small fortune, you cannot control the volume of your TV from your TV anymore--because you can't liar the Sonos app on it.  Also it's crashed s couple of times.  Not just the apps, but the speakers.  Then, a ""reboot"" helps. But the services are pretty good, it's just odd that once you fire up (from your phone or desktop) something like, say, Pandora, you've fired it up from one of your Sonos speakers--a different concept.  But that's why you can then fire up Sonos from another machine, and then not only see what's playing, but take control.

Phone freezes half the time, Sonos app constantly demanding update even tho it’s the latest version. Almost impossible to operate Sonos in normal manner without spending five minutes repeating the same steps over and over until the system works as desired. 

New app is full of bugs with iPhone 6s. Latest Sonos app update installed. OS 11.2 installed. Also logic to play music in different Groups is overly complex, especially in relationship to previous versions of app.

Honestly the interface is terrible, it always logs out of Apple Music, it never loads the playlists you play on the regular Apple Music app. Then even when you decide to give the app multiple opportunities, it fails time and time again. Logging into my Apple Music account to verify its me is annoying, it can't load my music library, it won't even list out the stations, then what CAN I play through it? I'm never buying Sonos again, only purchased it because I appreciated the ergonomic design, but I should have went with Bose. Never again.";"2019-10-05T14:40:23-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=293523031&type=Purple%20Software";"293523031";127;"en";"POSITIVE"

I have the Sonos  Boost installed as well but the application occasionally states I have insufficient bandwidth, the speakers start / stop randomly, and the songs skip from one to the next randomly too. That said, I can stream 4K video to my Apple TV and other in home devices without issue and my speed test shows 180 mbps.  Honestly I’d hold off on Sonos purchases for the holidays until they fix their issues.   What a mess...";"2018-12-01T09:35:55-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=293523031&type=Purple%20Software";"293523031";90;"en";"POSITIVE"

Not a good thing.

July Update: this issue is still not fixed.  Quite irritating.

Further update: After reviewing he suggested information re: router settings, the problem was resolved.  Thank you. I upped the app rating to reflect my renewed faith!";"2018-07-22T12:43:07-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=293523031&type=Purple%20Software";"293523031";79;"en";"POSITIVE"
