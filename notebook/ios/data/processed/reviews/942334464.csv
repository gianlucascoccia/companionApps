I also had issues setting up the monitor on my phone and had to use my roommate‚Äôs iPad. Got the system because we want to be alerted if CO alarm goes off while we‚Äôre not home (our furnace is very old, but can‚Äôt afford to replace it yet), but the app is focused on the camera set up which we don‚Äôt have. Based on product descriptions online I thought this system was more geared towards alarm monitoring, not camera.";"2019-11-07T05:27:34-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=942334464&type=Purple%20Software";"942334464";93;"en";"NEGATIVE"

5;4942465177;"Sky Shark Q";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id9035536";"2.0.10";1;"Nice idea, if it worked";"I bought the RemoteLync Monitor to monitor my smoke & CO alarms at my vacation home and notify me if they sounded. The system is monitored by a Central Station and this would give me a bit of extra notice, especially with the ‚ÄúCrew‚Äù feature.

Unfortunately, it doesn‚Äôt work. 

Setup: the written instructions don‚Äôt match the app instructions so you end up doing setup multiple times. 

Alarm Detection: it failed to capture my alarm sounding. 

Wi-Fi Stability: it failed to re-join my Wi-Fi network after being connected and having the connection dropped by hiding the SSID. (SSID had to be exposed to join first time, should have auto-joined after that.)
