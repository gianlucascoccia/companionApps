If you like data and smart home automation...this app and the sensors are great for just that!

Edit June 2016: my review below was answered VERY quickly. The developers added every detail that I requested. I am very happy and appreciate the responsiveness!

My next request is for additional smart control products to be supported such as the TP link wifi switches. Also I would like to see a waterproof reed sensor and PIR sensor.

April 2016:
Looking for a new feature to be added. I would like the ability to swipe on a notification on the lock screen and a ""pause for an hour"" button appears. Ideally the time frame could be configurable for each sensor. Also this button should be available on the Apple Watch when the notification appears there. Also another button (I believe you can do two) to disarm the sensor for a configurable amount of Time as well. This way I can stop notifications if I am in/out of the back door, during a specific time period or disarm the tag from affecting other smart items in the house.

I really hope this is a feasible feature that can be added.

To calibrate I put them in a plastic bag and dunked them in ice slush. Took them 30 minutes to stabilize at near 32. I set them both the same at 32.6 because figured that was probably right for my setup. Ice point is hard to get to 32 outside of a lab. They adjust to rising temperatures much quicker than falling temperatures. Between 40 to 75 degrees they agree within 1/2 degree with each other and within 1-1/2 degrees of two low cost electronic thermometers. That is very good.  After 3 weeks batteries still above 93%. Looking forward to using the Kumo app features. Humidity seems to track with my Nest. I haven't tested motion. The app is OK for my use but I think most people would find it confusing to set the tags up.

It is also very reasonable priced, when you compare a 20$ sensor to 100s if not 1000s of dollars of damage, it makes it worth it. I also enjoy the long battery life. The app does logout after a while, and it doesn't offer email support which would be nice, so if an alarm is triggered you would be pushed an email no matter whether you have the app open or not.

1. Under “Event History” it does not show the right temperature for each “Too hot” or “Too cold” event. Instead of showing the temperature at the time of the event, it just shows 92 degrees F. My alerts go off when it gets to 80 degrees F, so it is not accurate.

2. The “sub-apps” that are used to further control the main app sometimes shut themselves off. This is not ideal as the app can be used to monitor critical processes. 

3. The intervals at which a tag sends data to the receiver can not be changed from the app (I have not been able to). Must use online site.";"2015-01-13T12:30:50-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=508973799&type=Purple%20Software";"508973799";144;"en";"NEGATIVE"
