I have multiple problems, the first of which is that their customer support is next to nothing. When they can’t fob you off with stock, copy and paste, replies and they stick with it long enough to actually read your problems, well, then you are not any better off. I’ve long since abandoned the use of the blood pressure monitor, since it is quite useless for the purpose it was purchased, taking blood pressure and recording it wirelessly.
Simply does not work. 
Now the scale has been successful in weighing us both. Unfortunately, it has no ability to differentiate between people who are close to the same weight, like my husband and I, even though I always select my name at weighing. Again, after constant effort to attempt to get customer service, they just stopped communicating with me. I guess customer service is not their thing once they have your money. 
Now the app has removed the week display, or should I say, it’s gone from mine, I’m trying customer service again today but I’m quite honestly very much less than optimistic that I will have my problems addresses anytime soon, if at all.

I disagree with some of the opinions of others regarding the new app.  I went into it with an open mind (after the initial worry when I saw it was “new”) and after using it now for a while have discovered it is better in many ways.  The app is easier to navigate, it is in fact more intuitive to use not less.  Even though I appreciated many of the features of the previous app (some of which ARE missing from the current app), I find the new app much easier to navigate.  I also find the summary pages easier to find information on as well as easier on the eyes.  Nokia is a company who has been around for decades, they haven’t stayed in business by producing irrelevant products or ignoring their customers (I don’t work for them, I work in the medical field).

My reason for choosing the model I did the Steel HR was for heart rate and sleep tracking and here is where I am constantly feeling somewhat disappointed. I love this feature and the HR monitoring seems to do well. The sleep tracker however needs some major improvements, when it’s working it’s fantastic but you can’t really track sleep if it doesn’t even pick up you’ve slept 2 or 3 nights a week OR doesn’t record sleep activity until after the first time you’ve gotten out of bed to use the bathroom at 2 am. I’ve looked at all the fixes and reasons this might occur and none of them make sense to me. I don’t shake my arm wildly after I get into bed and often wake 3-4 hours after going to sleep in the same position I fell asleep, yet the tracker does not record. More frustrating is when it fails to record a night at all. It keeps record of my sleep heart rate, why is it not giving me sleep data? So I love it’s sleek design, it’s exercise features, and much of what they are trying to do but it’s more a a parlor game then a health gadget at this time. It does have a clock and the ability to get notifications is a huge plus.

The most recent update resulted in the app no longer recognizing a device I’ve been using for over a year. The app also now requires the user to create an account and to share health data with them. This is frankly another ignorant move to try to collect used data to use for marketing. This is no longer a health app for that reason. Save yourself some money and privacy and buy the simple blood pressure monitor from your local pharmacy. One that just uses batteries instead of you’d private information.

Update: a customer service person responded to this review promptly. The response included an apology. However the response did NOT include a solution. If Nokia can’t offer a solution I want a refund. The device stopped working because of a forced update that Nokia sent out.

Update: I contacted Withings customer service by email and requested a full refund. Withings responded by saying they will only warranty for 30 days. Even if they make the device useless due to their failure they will not refund the purchase. They are very stubborn and just thank you for your patience.

Data collection and presentation are at the core of the product.  Unfortunately, the app tries to hard to make data relevant, and becomes inconsistent across the experience.  Want to see your aggregate sleep for the week?  Awesome!  Now try to go back to the screen you were on.  The UI sometimes choose to provide no way of going back.  So, then your only choice is to exit the app and start over.  Want to rotate the app?  Cool...that will work, sometimes.  Other times it’s like fighting with an obstinate spouse.  Not happening unless it wants to make it happen.  Useful things like, average REM sleep are missing (or possibly buried so that can’t find it easily). This app desperately needs sparklines to be extended to many categories, and I should be able to choose which categories, in my dashboard.  The weight, steps and sleep sparklines are great.  Why not use them in a daily snapshot that represents the last week, in one dashboard view that also shows the other things that are already being captured?  It’s the inconsistency that is holding this app back.

Updated Review: After following the link in the developer response, i learned that health mate will only show an app in its notifications list, if the app pushed a notification while health mate was running in the background. this is why i never saw google calendar as an option for watch notifications. this isn’t very intuitive; i would suggest adding help text that explains this. Still a good app tho!

Original Review: The new notification and on-watch workout selection systems are game changers for the steel hr. Kudos to the deva for delivering these features. I just have a few minor quibbles: 1) no google calendar notifications. 2) the new workout mode continuously shows the elapsed time in full brightness instead on-demand check ins. 3) it would also be nice to see a summary (elapsed time, avg and peak hr, etc) when you complete a workout.

I like the fact that the alarm on my watch vibrates to wake me up to get to Crossfit class without waking my wife. I looked at many options when trying to find a device that would help track mostly my sleep patterns. I am working with my physician in also trying to monitor oxygen levels and other factors. 
I like the feature that Nokia has of measuring steps taken in a day with the smaller dial. It helps motivate me to walk more. Also, like the feature where I activate the watch at the start of my workout and end it at the end of the workout.

Actually, yes: why do you think I got this scale?).   I have gotten the family set up on the scale (relatively painless) but my wife can’t get it to talk to her phone. 

I wish the developers would just focus on weighing us and communicating with a smart phone over Bluetooth. I don’t want an account and another password. I would like the displays simplified so you can see weight over time (with dates) and maybe other parameters on their own page. The app tries to squeeze way too much onto the screen of an iPhone. 

As for the scale, it is quite sensitive but not stable. I stand there watching it flip tenth of a pound digits so long that sometimes the scale shuts down without a reading. A little signal filtering would help. Also, the percent body fat is all over the map (I doubt it fluctuates by more that 1% day to day).

I was asked to provide a considerable amount of information, which I happily did as I assumed it would lead to my problem being resolved more quickly. Unfortunately, that’s not what happened. Here is the response I received, “Our development team is aware of the loop effect which is causing this issue to take place (HM → other app → AH → HM).

I do apologize however, we do not have a planned fix, we recommend users only export from Apple Health.“ 

My reply was that their response was unacceptable as according to the description in the App Store at the time was that the app “plays well with others” (in all caps).

First, the app now requires multiple authentications before opening if you have passcode access on. Inconvenient, but not a dealbreaker. Then, the app started adding phantom steps when the phone was charging. It’d add steps at a constant rate during times when the phone, and any step counters, were stationary, at a fixed rate (usually 270 steps/hour). When attempting to shut off step counting in the app, I found it was no longer possible - and when I contacted support about it, I had to send them screenshots from my app to prove to them the option was missing. Support was unable to help, so eventually I just removed the app’s permission to write steps to Apple health at the OS level. I updated today hoping they’d been addressing these issues but now it’s no longer even *importing* step data from the Apple health app (it cuts off right at the time I updated!)
I hope the developer can successfully address these issues. I really like their health hardware, and the software, until about six months ago, has been rock solid.

This 1 star review is not for the watch/app overall, it is for the sleep score update. I find it very damaging to rate the quality of our sleep on a point system of 1-100, most especially the negative evaluations of each element of sleep. Examples of these are: 

“Sleep score 20. Depth= Bad.”

“2hrs 6mins isn’t much...try to sleep a little longer tonight.” Next to a bright orange exclamation point. 

“OK, so, it’s time to bring sleep back into your life.” Next to a bright red exclamation point. 

“Your bed and rise times diverge too much from those of these last few days.” Next to a bring red exclamation point. (This was a night I slept well and long.)

As if I don’t already feel the weight of my lack of sleep and it’s negative reflection on my health challenges. As if I don’t already feel stressed and even grieved about the harsh reality of being unable to sleep well. As if I should “Just try harder! Just do better!” As if we don’t get this message enough in every other area of life. 

They need to make these CRITICAL COMMENTS OPTIONAL. Make the sleep NEGATIVE SCORE OPTIONAL.

Just plug it in, let it do it’s thing, then review your results and look at your graph. All very good.

However, I do not like the changes you have made to the color coded BP ranges. I realize that guidelines on BP may have been relaxed somewhat. However as I have high BP and am on meds I like to keep a close eye on it and have strict standards for myself. I do not like that the “Elevated” range is now coded with green rather than yellow. I want to be visually alerted if my results go outside the “Normal” range. Perhaps allow the user to modify the colors? Your development team apparently forgot to change the colors displayed on the timeline, so we have inconsistent color coding from one screen to another!

As others have commented, it is disappointing that the app can not adjust to portrait mode (other apps are able to deal with this).";"2019-05-23T15:22:33-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=542701020&type=Purple%20Software";"542701020";180;"en";"POSITIVE"

I'm the type of person who reads the manual, looks at all the online forums, and only then when I still can't find the answer do I contact support.

My one major complaint about the app is the detection of elevation/flights climbed feature. It requires that I get a specific watch from Withings that detects altimeter, instead of allowing it to access that information from my Apple Watch or the iPhone Health app. Would someone respond and let me know if this is something that can be done or would I just have to go without?

First concern is the drastic difference in reported body fat. The Renpho reports 13.6% body fat and the Withings reports 23.7% which is a big difference. I know the Renpho is an entry level scale at 1/4 of the price, but still makes me wonder which is more accurate. I would consider myself to fall somewhere in between the two. 

Two things lacking which it doesn’t import is Nutrition and Sleep. 

I have an iPhone and Apple Watch. I use MyPlate from LiveStrong to track nutrition and AutoSleep from Tantissa which both write data to Apple’s Health app. And I do see that information in the Health app. 

I would like to see that data imported in a future update! Specially Sleep which already shows up on the web but in my case shows No Recent Data. 

I’m sure that most of the IOS users would love to see this added!

This update takes huge steps backwards.  UI is fancier but nowhere as streamlined and easy to use as the prior version.  They have taken out the feature to share with my doctor, or buried it somewhere I cannot find.  The only option I see is to share a single measurement, which is useless to me.  This is not a social app.  I need to share a history so my doctor can see trends and I don't have to waste time sending every time I take a measurement.

I am still regretting choosing withings over FitBit when I bought 2 scales and 2 watches. I was a happy camper with withings and it's awesome app until Nokia came along and ruined features and functionality in one sweep, offering nothing in return.

Nokia has improved its app with the latest update, and users are starting to acknowledge it, but let's not forget that it is still missing functionality and features that were already present and working in the past; that is: this has been a step forward, but right after 200 steps back, so you are still 199 behind. 
Simply own your massive misstep and give us the old app back, that is he right thing to do. To continue pushing your ridiculous decisions down your customers throats is never going to work.

The battery has to be charged which I wasn’t so sure about at first but it chargers quickly, usually when I go into the shower and return shortly after the watch is charged.  I did have to buy a second charger however when on vacation as I did not pack the charger.

I am seeing positive trends and have had no issues!

I cannot understand why Nokia bought Withings only to have what were medical grade devices/software (I am a physician) now degraded to unreliable products, presumably mostly software related.

This was quite frustrating, because I weigh myself twice per day for monitoring purposes and I lost three of my full body analyses because the Body+ scale won’t do an analysis if it doesn’t recognise the user - only records the weight.

There was another day when it randomly didn’t recognise me also. But worked fine on the following use.

And then you move on to a vain attempt at obtaining your blood pressure. At this point I am glad it never gave me a reading because I am sure my blood pressure was through the roof!

If you hold the power button for less than one second it does not turn on.

For the Aura, the app will periodically turn off your alarm, provide no notice, and simply offer a warning if you happen to open the app (as in, once you’ve overslept) that the alarm was disabled. How could they possibly build that in? How do they allow this? How are they clearly aware it can happen, but choose not to at least send an alert to your phone that your alarm is off?

It’s only a sensible thing if Withings/Nokia actively hate their customers. This is reasonable, since I now hate each of the idiots who work there.

First, the time on the watch doesn't update automatically. I travel across time zones regularly, and my high tech watch can't even execute its most basic function (telling time) correctly. Syncing it is more complicated and time consuming than on my 50 year old mechanical watch. 

Second, dismissal of an incoming phone call or text is not replicated on the phone. What's the sense using the watch interface to pass on the call if the phone in your pocket won't stop ringing?

Third, text messages get cut off. I was thrilled when, after an app update, my Steel HR started displaying the full content of text messages. However, i was quickly made aware that the watch has a pretty low character limit, and ends up truncating a significant number of messages.

When I looked at the app a few months ago, the trend line looked flat, suggesting that the workouts I was doing weren't having any effect. Now, I haven't been working out as much for various reasons, but the line makes it seem like I had lost so much weight during the previous period and gained a ton of weight since then. If I look at the data points, however, the distribution is pretty much the even so the line should be fairly flat.

To their credit, both the app and the scale have become more reliable syncing over time. That's great.

But in the recent major update, I've stopped getting notifications of my weigh-ins and I've started getting notifications from some health coach AI saying things like ""Welcome to Health Mate!"" and ""Do you know your BMI?"". Then when you open that up, there's just some generic health tutorial. I don't need that.

There's no clear way to disable the health coach messages and according to my notification settings I should still be receiving weight in notifications.

What is most annoying is that I didn't change anything other than letting the app update itself. I suspect the core user base of this app are those with a connected health device.

Heart rate data still won’t export to apple health, and the measurement table shows nothing.

It doesn’t make any sense that one can plot the average heart rate over time, but not the sleeping heart rate, which is probably a more useful indicator to follow over time (as a decent proxy for resting heart rate).

There’s also way too much information in the app itself, organized in a haphazard way—It unnecessarily collects info from other health apps but does not organize the info intelligently or compactly.

Health Mate — the companion app for the watch and other devices, is a constant disappointment.  

Bugs are extraordinarily slow to get fixed and recents updates have made viewing my data less convenient.  The new dashboard view is much less helpful than the timeline and I wish I could have that as the default view.

The app continues to send notifications of outgoing calls to the watch.  I don’t need or want a notification that I’m calling someone as I’m pretty aware of it when I do.

For some reason, I can graph my height over time but not temperature.

Sleep tracking is spotty at best.  The app cannot distinguish laying down and watching TV from sleeping and also routinely misses awakenings.

But I think the developers listened to this and started releasing updates to the watch's firmware. 
As it currently stands, it has definitely improved from the initial state. However, it still has a ways to go to catch up to the real time performance and accuracy of its competitors like garmin and fitbit.

Frankly, there’s too much to cover in an App Store review. 

For example, the trend lines make no sense. It looks like some sort of attempt (emphasis on attempt) at spline fitting, when a simple moving average or autoregressive smoothing would be more appropriate. Further, the trend line tends to “lead” the actual data points.  Finally, the trend line tends to be biased to one side of the noise in the trend (which means that the parameters are totally inappropriate if they ARE using an autoregressive model for the trend line)

Cons:

I’ve got the Health Mate app because we bought a Nokia scale a few months ago. The app is a fine way to see basic info. 

The lack of 2-way Apple Health connectivity is really disappointing. If I’d understood that I would have likely bought a different scale. I’d really like to get a Steel HR watch, but Nokia’s decision to keep my data and not allow it to sync out means I can’t. I’ll probably end up buying an Apple Watch instead, which is a shame because I think the Steel and Steel HR watches are really sharp.

One missing piece. There should a way to force the app to take a blood pressure reading.

Once the reading is taken, and the app returns to the main screen, there is no way to force another reading.

Some small important improvements for me...

- the way you calculate weight loss for a month seems inaccurate.  Somehow the weight between monthly transition days seems counted incorrectly- or not counted at all.  This causes my monthly readings, which are important to me- to be useless.  Help!

-  My biggest problem is me.  Occasionally I will fall off the “weight myself everyday” (or for others, it may be a different time period) wagon.  You have my permission to create a “nag me” function if I stop weighing in.  You can even make it completely obnoxious so that I would rather weigh in than encounter the reminder.

Hi, 

I really like the Health Mate app, the design is really simple and beautiful. I have one issue with running app on my Apple Watch, it always shows “Please sign in on your iPhone”. I restarted both apps and devices and clicked this message on Apple Watch while the app is open on iPhone but nothing seems to work and connect these two. Any suggestions?

Also, I would like to see change through time in body fat % / body fat kilograms, currently whenever I click on body fat it takes me to weight graph. 

Btw, setting target weight is a really nicely done piece of UI!

I had a perfectly good scale.  I upgraded to the Withings scale for only one reason: it had a pulse wave velocity feature.
Then along comes Nokia, and they take the single feature away.  Why? Not proven?  Not accurate enough?  Work on the firmware, and add a disclaimer.
