I really hope they didn't intentionally take down the TV audio equalizer and hopefully they bring it back in the next updates because the sound is really disappointing now! Even with the treble and bass level all the way up its nowhere near as loud or sounds as good as it did before! Please bring back the equalizer choice setting for the TV audio settings so the TV will sound better like it did before I really miss how great my tv sounded now it's way too quiet and not a good quality sound it's ridiculous that I have to turn the volume level to 50 just to hear decently!

Quite simply it sucked! They offered free remotes by mail to pretty much the whole line of tvs besides mine of course.  So i patiently waited- what else could I do. I’d purchased the tv refurbished and couldn’t return it.  Well more than 12 months later, I can proudly say I can use my tv with ease again.  Best part is I can start a stream from my iphone or on the tv itself (using my phone as the remote) and then still use my phone for other things while I’m watching.    The app has made huge improvements in too many areas to list.  It’s still has a ways to go before it’s complete fluid and quick. There is lag, but at least they are finally constantly working to improve it as I get updates more than once a month now.

 Update: just now (about 5 min from writing this review) I decided to use my old iPod running iOS 9 and my iPhone 5s running iOS 10 and download the Vizio app which of course is not supported until you go to your purchase history and download it there. It then asked me if I wanted to instal most recent version compatible to the device. BAM it worked perfect in fact as soon as i opened the app it instantly worked better than it ever has and recognized device instantly. So clearly this latest update is to blame.

Response to developer: My issue? I stated my issue and it’s exactly the same as all the tons of latest reviews…. Your latest update broke the connection and communication with app and soundbar. Meanwhile, previous version immediately connects and works without issue. And yes I’ve reset, removed device on app, attempted re establishing connection, I’ve tried everything possible and no go. I’ve looked at your responses at “solutions” on other reviews and it seems they are all the same a typical cut and copy response to everyone telling you that latest update broke the connection and communication. It’s not an issue with soundbar or network otherwise previous app version wouldn’t connect instantly and work like a charm.

No stars for this app and it’s implementation";"Vizio’s marketing dept.  wants me to change my review.  So after multiple calls to their tech support I was told that SmartCast doesn’t work with my newish Vizio tv.  They wanted me to buy MORE of their products (a new remote w a menu button) to make my brand new Vizio soundbar work w my Vizio tv.  Pretty insulting, and a shady business practice. I pointed out this absurdity and they  refused to send me the remote for free, claiming some out of warranty nonsense(clearly not a warranty issue).  They offered to “go up a level” in their tech support, and then called when I wasn’t available, and never called at the time previously arranged by them.  I left a voicemail and they never called back.  I’m left with hundreds of $ of Vizio products that  won’t connect with each other and thus won’t work.  I left a message and they never called back. I cannot recommend this app or brand.  My original review follows below: 

This app is useless if you have a Vizio e48-D0 tv and Vizio M51A-H6 and follow all set up directions, including troubleshooting options. To connect the phone (iPhone 12) to the tv, You need to use a tv remote that has a “menu” button, but the e48-d50’s remote doesn’t have a menu button because Vizio is too cheap to add one. Only way to get devices to work together is to cut the power to tv and sound bar at the beginning of EACH use.

This makes the remote a thing of the past. The only downside would be if internet was out on the TV and phone, so don’t throw the button dino out yet. I’ve been dying for a solution that would allow me to use a keyboard to type in search fields and login information for apps. You should promote this app in system settings. I love it! It has all the functions of my standard remote and more.  The favorite section is the best because it lets me quick launch all my favorite apps.

Anytime you open it up you get a pop up saying it wants Bluetooth access to find new devices (even if you’re not trying to connect anything new). You can close it once, and it’s fine. But if you go out of the app and come back the pop up returns. And this time it doesn’t go away. As soon as you hit close it pops back up. It happens so fast you can’t even close or switch out of the app (at least on newer iPhones without a physical button). The only way to get out of the endless requests for Bluetooth permissions is to let it take you to the settings (it takes you to the wrong area by the way) and then open up the app switching menu and close the app from there. So unless you’re just sitting there with your phone awake and on this app, you’ll have to do this whole work around every time you want to open an app or use your phone as a remote. 

And you know the extra kicker? The app has Bluetooth permission. I gave it Bluetooth permission the first time I used it to connect my TV.

I have 4 Vizio smart cast devices. A 65” E Series, 75”Quantum Series, and 2 different Smart Cast surround sound systems. The app use to work well until the regular app updates that have resulted in it being unusable on any of my Vizio devices. Since the app is unusable on multiple devices it’s not the devices it’s definitely the app. You can open the app, select the device, it works for a few seconds, then the screen disappears. You can repeat as much as you want with the same results. Very frustrating. The one Quantum Series television I purchased was over $1,500 alone. A big selling point was the app. I’m not wanting excuses, responses, or reasons. Please just get on this and fix the problem. Don’t release updates unless they are needed and stable. Vizio is a great product, let’s keep it that way and  let’s start by making this app as reliable and remarkable as it once was.  Like when I wrote the original review below. Thank you!

So here’s my story. doesAfter our TV broke down, we got a new one, then looking at the reviews finding out it has something to do with a software update, as our TV was doing the same as others, turning on and off randomly. then none of our sound bars are working with the SmartCast app, unable to connect to the SmartCast app at all. Come to find out, the app is broken after the latest iOS update. This is awful!

They took something that was working, removed it, and replaced it with something I did not ask for, is substantially more complicated, and most importantly doesn't work. TV companies should stop trying to be software companies. They are terrible at it. Make a tv that has a nice picture.

It's incredibly frustrating to have a thing that was working stop working because Vizio decided to push an update I didn't ask for or agree to.

Vizio has adopted the minimalist approach regarding remote controls shipped with their TVs with devotion. This has resulted in the directional keys in the circled layout of the remote being a singular failure point. No matter the device the app is installed on the directional buttons will randomly cease to have any affect and when they do function often behave as the center tap. No method of restoring the navigation function seems to work. Power cycling individual system components or as a group, reinstalling the app doesn’t fix the issue at will. I don’t know the cause and given the model range affected, likely is an obstacle that currently has no acceptable solution.

I’ve had the app crash during viewings on a number of occasions and not come back from it while half of a decent show is on.

The sound system, the subwoofer farts when sound goes under 50hz. 

The TV is connected via optic audio cable, yet they still don’t do a very good job of turning volume up and down together.  

The sound system will random cut out, fairly often. I’d say 3-8 times a month. Requiring me to climb up in a chair to unplug the sound bar for a hard reset.

The tv itself, when you use the smart tv features like selecting an app, it will often freeze and also require me to unplug and wait. Or use the “soft cycle reset” function. 

The soft reset is the most used feature on my tv, which is sad. 

Oh and this app.... Jesus... I can’t even use it because of the Bluetooth feature pop-up, that is needed. Considering my entire home is connected to wifi, the Vizio products that I bought are designed doe wifi, and Bluetooth is irrelevant to the hardware I own personally... it couldn’t be more frustrating that I can’t even use the app...

I’ve been able to pair my TV with the app in the past, but every other time you use the app it will not be able to view the settings for the paired TV. The only way to fix this problem is to uninstall the app and then re pair your TV to your phone. This worked for me on 5 separate occasions, but recently I haven’t been able to pair my TV to the app.

The app when you try to pair uses Bluetooth but typically doesn’t work at all. I can’t tell you why. Then it automatically switches to turning your TV into a wifi hotspot that you should be able to pair your phone with. The problem with this is even though your phone says it’s made your TV into a wifi hotspot, it actually hasn’t because, you guessed it, your phone isn’t paired to your TV. 

What’s the thought process here? Make a terrible app so that no one buys your TVs again? It’s not like I can change the TV settings with the remote that came with the TV. I literally have to use this horrible, unusable app in order to change contrast, or even adjust brightness.

Good luck trying to binge watch something because if you have use the app to control playback or select a new episode it will search for the device and shut it off, so you have force close the app and turn back on the device, locate it, open your 3rd party app, locate content and then pray to the gods it will stream correctly. I wish I had 2 more hands so I could give this app 4 thumbs down.

I am tech-savvy and have good equipment, such as a NETGEAR Nighthawk Tri-Band 3200ac router that blasts good signal through the house; it was Vizio’s fault for selling this product and it’s even worse today.  I cannot use the remote to setup the TV at all. Imagine that. It’s unconscionable that Visio would have destroyed their well-earned brand loyalty by marketing this. 

You can get a Roku device from $30-80 that will work flawlessly and allow you to use your Vizio SmartCast TV. Better yet, avoid Vizio SmartCast altogether and get a different TV next time.

- very limited two-way communication. A good example is volume. You should have a volume slider that knows what the volume is set at. Not just buttons to blindly turn up or turn down the volume. Plus a slider would be quicker. Same thing with on/off. There should be an on button and an off button. This is something that more sophisticated devices and remotes can do.

Update: to developer,

Your troubleshooting is incorrect and it’s actually an application issue with apple. Your coding on the app side doesnt fit the requirements on apples side for full compatibility with homekit. 

Before i even initially contacted customer support, i followed your troubleshooting steps. When i called customer service they blamed apple and claimed apple needed to fix it on their side. Load of bull if you ask me.

So you found the remote feature. NOW let’s hit the power button several times, in hopes that the app realizes you are actually trying to use it for its main function...and surprise, STILL NO ABILITY TO PAIR TO THE TV. SO...please see step one above.

3. When you change to another app for 10 seconds and go back to the Smartcast app (not closed), it needs 5 seconds to realize that you need to use the remote function. Gives me anxieties.

This tv is also technically a Display which lacks a tuner.  This required purchase of a tuner to watch over the air digital channels.  

Finally, the SmartCast apps are limited and quality of image pales in comparison to Apple TV, not to mention the new Apple TV 4K.
