Even with some of its quirks (it’ll miss certain areas within a specific cleaning map and often will clean areas outside of a specific cleaning map + add that area to the cleaning map without being told to do so, it’s also quite a bit nosier than I anticipated, but we’ve gotten used to it at this point), I still think it deserves 5 stars. I have wood floors and a husky mix who sheds quite a bit. The dust and hair build up can get outta hand quick. We swifter daily but went a stint without running the Roomba and it was all too clear the significant difference it makes. We were constantly tracking dust and hair on our socks or house shoes, with Roomba, that doesn’t happen. The device deftly maneuvers around corners and against the edges of furniture. It will run over cords every now and again, but for the most part, doesn’t get tangled up in them. I’ve only ever had a couple of clogs, which were quickly and conveniently resolved. I haven’t used the schedule features because I prefer to be around when it’s running, just to be aware in case it runs into something. But if you’re the type who generally has an open space and remember to put things up, you could certainly take advantage of that feature. All in all, there are still at least a few improvements to be made, but for what it is, I’m happy with it!";"2021-04-03T08:42:34-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1012014442&type=Purple%20Software";"1012014442";262;"en";"POSITIVE"

We have 2 dogs and a 2500 sq. ft. house. Without Roomba, I would need to vacuum every other day. When the i7 is working, it does a great job of vacuuming between the monthly housekeeping services. It heads out each morning on the schedule I have set, recharges and empties the bin as needed until the job is done. If during the week I notice an area that is particularly dirty, I pull out my phone and tell it to clean that area…. much easier than pulling out the vacuum cleaner. It is amazingly good at mapping the rooms, maneuvering, and getting itself unstuck from tight spaces, cords, and obstacles. 

In the 3 years I’ve had this model, it has quit functioning properly twice. However, iRobot customer service is easy to access by phone, and the service reps are outstanding. They guide you through diagnostics and fixes. When once this didn’t solve the problem, they sent me a shipping carton to send the robot in for service, eventually replacing the robot. 

So, I’m giving the robot 5 stars for its incredible usefulness when it’s working, deduct 2 stars for the times when it has quit functioning properly, and add back 2 stars for the outstanding customer service.";"2021-09-27T08:50:01-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1012014442&type=Purple%20Software";"1012014442";218;"en";"POSITIVE"

After two mapping runs I am seriously impressed on the precision this unit can be programmed for on the smart map. That said, I was surprise/irritated that even with the advanced mapping, that it still requires light to complete a cleaning cycle, or it errors out. Obviously, the most convenient time to clean my common areas is overnight and leaving my house lit up for this is undesirable. Also, given the detail of the smart map, being able to see the actual location of the robot on that smart map in real time seems a worthy integration. If I am running a cleaning cycle from away from my home or even in the other room, it’d be nice to see where it is in the cycle. Having the green “done” area populate on the smart map as the unit covers that ground would be a great feature that relays quality info. Also, being able to manually steer the robot with an integrated in-app directional pad, even if only on local wifi control, is something even lower brands already offer. Directing it to a new room to learn, or driving it to my seat on the couch for some maintenance, etc... this in-app feature is a must. Forward, left, right, backwards... easy peasy.

I went with the i7+ for a few reasons. I wanted the the emptying base. And I also wanted the smart mapping. It has mapped my entire apartment minus the bathroom which we are still working on it to recognize the bathroom. We’ve already set areas for it to clean. I picks up all of my cats fur off the floor. And it has cleaned all around the litter box! It’s not meant to replace your normal vacuum but to lessen the amount of times you do vacuum. I don’t have a set schedule for it due to having pets so in the event my cat misses the litter box I don’t have the roomba going and dragging it around the house. Over the winter it picked up any road salt that our shoes brought into the house! All in all, it was worth the money! I do wish we could have a little fun with it. Maybe have the app have a “game” mode where you can control it like a remote controlled car and drive it around the house while it cleans?

Also... the next problem is with the mapping function...it takes at least 2 full training runs to map my apartment and then I can name the rooms etc.. I can tell it to clean one room and it will work once! Then all I get from that point on is the maps will reappear in a grayed out form and you will not be able to select any room at all for the unit to clean...you can edit,rename, and save a new configuration but you still can’t tell it to clean any of the rooms!

I still suggest users to keep inspecting it and clean out once in a while to keep it performing at its best all the time. Noise level is tolerable but it’s up to us to manage when and how frequently it should clean so that it does not interfere while we are at home.

There’s a notification center in the app, and for as long as I’ve used the app there’s never beenANYTHING in there. But today I was just randomly looking through the help section and come across something labeled “care and maintenance” and opening it I find there are all these tasks which are apparently overdue. Why would that be in the Notification Center? What’s t Notification Center for if not that kind of stiff? Instead I guess I have to regularly go to the help section, then go to the “care and main.” section, THEN see what tasks are needed or coming up. And seemingly no notification for filter needing to be replaced. And I know I know, I could just task myself with those duties and not depend on the app.  I just don’t understand WHY the app wouldn’t notify me about those things. It’s clearly tracking the robots use, as well as some cleaning needs, so why not just throw in reminders instead of making me dig around the app to find them (or in the case of filters not have them at all)?

Grass, twigs, leaves, bugs and dirt seem to be magically transported from the yard to the house on a constant basis. I used to vacuum every other day and couldn’t keep up. But now that we have Rosie, that problem is under control. She industriously vacuums night and day to keep the house clean. It really is a profound difference in cleanliness. It’s not perfect, but it is a major leap forward. Complaints are minor: the map she created of our house looks like it was done by a drunken blind man. Setting exclusion zones works, but is not very accurate. She sometimes gets lost, crashes and burns when trying to dock, or closes a door behind her and gets locked in a room. And she is noisy. But overall, she makes life around here easier, so she is a welcome addition. With regard specifically to the app, it works well and communicates consistently. I would like more control over the map, such as editing it to correct errors. And the different cleaning zones should have a “clean now” button so you can run them as needed.

After a month and several attempts, I think I finally got eack of them to map about 90% of the house.  So far the units do not share the same map that I can figure out.  Sharing maps would be helpful as the vacuum covers the house way faster and easier than the Braava M6.

When editing the map the app attempts to save after every divider edit.  Each save takes 45 seconds to a minute and often times out without saving.  Adding exclusion zones is nearly impossible as the system times out after each attempt to save the zone. Much improvement is needed.

On the devices themselves.  I like that the s9 empties itself. The negative is that it cannot seem to crawl onto area rugs or mats to clean them-instead it just pushes them and many times just gets stuck.  I used to have a Neato Botvac.  It had no trouble climbing onto area rugs, bath mats or kitchen mats, but it did not empty itself.  All in all I think the Neato cleaned better, but often needed it’s filter cleaned and dumped—thus the reason we changed to Roomba.  Still not sure if it was the right choice.  On the Braava M6-when you get it to wet mop it does a good job.  It has a hard time climbing off of its base to get started.

This was the first roomba I owned that could connect to WiFi and be controlled by this app. Recently, I noticed that the battery indicator about the “Clean” button within the app showed the battery level a little less than 50%. Initially, I thought that maybe this roomba may just need a long time to charge, and the bar wouldn’t move until the roomba was on its charger for a while. After a night of charging (and it said it was charging), the battery level indicator within the app was at the same level. I thought maybe the roombas battery was defective, but I ran it for a full job (around and hour and 45 minutes) with no issues. So after that, I believe that there is a bug in the app which doesn’t show the true battery level of the robot. I really enjoy the roomba app and the bot itself, but hope this can be fixed.

Telling Alexa to clean the mess by the coach and then watching it happen is like something out of the Jetsons and far more likely to happen then the alternative; me getting off the couch, walking downstairs to the utility closet, carrying the vacuum upstairs, finding the closest outlet, cleaning the mess, emptying the bin, and finally returning the vacuum to the closet. In other words I can 100% overlook the occasional error or issue where I might have to “rescue” Roomba and bring it back to its home, in exchange for more frequent cleaning that is actually kind of fun to watch.

Then I spent the next day or two retraining the robots to relearn the house, relabeling all my rooms, and rebuilding my schedules. As I said, a major pain in the backside! With so many people reporting similar problems, have you guys looked at your app to find the source of these issues? One more data point for you:  I noticed that after getting everything redone, the app kept crashing. Fortunately, it did not throw away all my new work.I also needed to delete one of the room lines I created, because apparently your app crashed if I tried editing the schedule containing more than six or seven rooms.";"2020-09-30T17:00:38-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1012014442&type=Purple%20Software";"1012014442";231;"en";"NEGATIVE"

Once he/she gets used to the layout of your home, you rarely have to vacuum or sweep. Pair it with the Braava jet, and it’s a wrap. The Braava jet is a little special at times in terms of navigation, mapping, and returning home. The vacuum is relatively quiet, but if you are not a heavy sleeper, I don’t recommend programming him/her to clean at night. The Braava jet is very quiet and I have not experienced the streaking that the other reviews mention. Or maybe since my floors are clean, I don’t mind if I can see tracks on the floor in the light. If the Roomba gets stuck on anything like the edge of a blanket or carpet, he can get him/herself unstuck more often than not. Just make sure you pick up any cords on the floor.

We try to do a walk around the house to make sure the floors are free of anything she shouldn’t pick up. We also check and clean the filter at least once while she is vacuuming. We have a large hairy dog and she picks up every last hair off the floor!

With Molly, she stops wherever she is and alerts us by making a sound and sending a message via the app to my phone . Then we have to go find her . A minor inconvenience but nothing that makes me want to give her up for adoption ☺️I’ve scheduled Molly to vacuum every afternoon at 12:30.

We are still deciding a name for our Roomba, but we love that we can creatively command our Roomba with her unique name with our Alexa.

Contrary to some of the other reviews we read for this app, we found the app is actually very user friendly. Connecting our Roomba to the Internet was straightforward; the graphics are very cute and the professional videos explain all the steps. It’s really one of the best end user training processes in an app I’ve seen. And if we had issues, their help section is pretty detailed (not that we’ve had issue). We were also able to link multiple user accounts to the same Roomba. So my girlfriend and I can both interact with the Roomba and not share a password.

Some of the cool features we already enjoy is the maps we see after every completed clean (we have a Roomba 960), the real-time updates in what our Roomba is doing as it is doing it, the customization of a schedule for every day of the week, and the ease of using the app for what it is meant to do - get the Roomba to start and stop cleaning.

As a tech person, what I find rewarding is that it performs firmware version updates over WiFi to the Roomba itself. So the actual robot software, and not just the app, are improving over time

She cleans the kitchen, dining room, and living areas in the early mornings, before we get up. And she cleans the bedrooms and sleeping areas while we’re up and working, relaxing. So we never get in each others way. 
We’ve had her for about two years. Just recently, we noticed she was having trouble getting over the threshold between our tile floors and hardwood floors. When I checked her out, I just covered her wheels were worn clear down to smooth plastic rims. New wheels we’re not expensive at all, easy to replace, and comparing them to the old wheels, I was amazed that she had kept cleaning for as long as she had.

All the floors are ceramic tile so there are groves between tiles. If there is a heavier amount of grit or fine sandy particals in the groves, Mr. Wolf seems unable to vacuum them up.

I purchased an Echo 3rd generation to be able to use with Alexa. Well that was a waste also because Alexa isn’t communicating well with my i7.  I have a list of the commands to use for my i7, 85% of the time they don’t work. So I tried using the commands for the Braava mop, switching out the word “mop” for “vacuum” and that worked a little more often. When it didn’t work with those words I would use the word “clean” in my command and that would sometimes work when the others didn’t. I don’t understand the I inconsistency quite honestly.

First the 890 vacuum itself is great & actually cleans much better than my upright 12 amp Bissell PowerForce vacuum. My only complaint with the app at this point is that the recent update (version 3.3.0.) seems to have removed the battery percentage indicator which used to show the Roomba device’s battery status in a percentage format as opposed to having to rely on a small battery bar graph. 

Also something that I’ve thought could be improved upon since starting use of the app is within the “history” section under “status” it only shows either “completed” or “cancelled”. I’m just saying it would be nice to know as to why the job was cancelled (eg: battery needs charged; user manually cancelled; bin is full; etc). 

Everything else is great though…being able to start the device, adjust the schedule, &/or turn the day’s schedule on/off while not being home is awesome. 

Last little suggestion is that it would be nice if one could schedule multiple times to clean within one day. This would make it possible to schedule a job, allow the device to charge after the job is complete, then resume or start a new job after charging for “X” amount of time. 

In the end though, if you have a WiFi enabled iRobot device, this app is a must have. The pros heavily out-way the cons here.";"2019-01-27T12:01:16-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1012014442&type=Purple%20Software";"1012014442";264;"en";"POSITIVE"

My internet is 100% fine, no weak signals or anything, so it’s just the app breaking when i click health.

Another issue is how the app handles its mapping. You’d THINK that when the roomba discovers a new area it would automatically update the smart map…except it doesn’t. You have to go through your cleaning history, find the most recent map there, and THEN click update map. At the very least they could have the option be found on the “maps” page, but nope, you have to search through the history on the main page and find the option to update the map there.

     But I am glad I kept my old roomba. ( Old number 3) I can pick the Number 3 up and move it to smaller areas missed by Number 4. Number 4 doesn’t like to be picked up so it just goes back to the base or goes in a completely wrong direction from where I want it to go.
     I hope future versions will have some kind of memory storage and will retain what it learned. It would also be useful to have a       “return to last area “ button or mode in case it missed some spots.

With our iRobot I set a schedule to clean while I’m at work and a lot of times it completes the entire job. It’s not perfect, sometimes it don’t make it back to the charger so it powers down underneath a bed or dresser to make it extra fun to find. Other times it will get stuck and give an error that makes it shut down until cleared. Recognizing where it gets stuck I have helped it avoid some obstacles but it’s always finding others. The black squares on my dining room rug make it think it’s on a cliff, short of getting a new rug I’m not sure how to fix that. Even with its quirks and half the time not making it back to the charger it is still well worth the investment. I would definitely miss it if I didn’t have it anymore. I even put it in my camper when we get back from trips to let it clean, I know I’m lazy!";"2021-06-13T16:15:35-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1012014442&type=Purple%20Software";"1012014442";187;"en";"POSITIVE"

It ran daily for an hour and then returned to base, at which time it’s collection bin would need emptied.  When running, it’s cleaning pattern seemed entirely random, and the roller bristles would need cut and cleaned of human and pet hair almost weekly.  We’d finally had enough.  Roomba i6 was on sale during Amazon’s prime days so we decided to go for it.  All of those previous issues with the Eufy vac are no longer a concern. The robot EMPTIES ITSELF after completing its daily run.  It’s cleaning pattern is not random at all, but instead resembles alawn-mowing  pattern.  The no-tangle rollers have never needed cleaned.  The app is phenomenal, and allows for individualized cleaning of any room at any time.  I could go on and on about this but it still wouldn’t do it enough justice.

1- There should be a progress bar or list of rooms/spaces next to a job in progress showing how much of the work is done or what rooms are finished. Ideally it should be able to give you a rough estimate or range of time on how long the job takes based on previous cleanings. I think this is a fairly simple but really cool feature that can be added.
2- The Keep Out Zone or Clean Zones can be identified much easier and accurately if instead of user haphazardly drawing on the map hoping to get the right region, that Roomba actually draws it on the map itself. Here is how: Place a feature that once it is turned on (under the map, add zones) the user can manually, slowly move the Roomba near or along the Keep Out/Clean zone and Roomba transmits the coordinates to the smart map. This can be fine tuned by repeating it or let it do a trial run just alone that area to confirm. Takes 5 min with the used and so much more accurate. 

Hope the App developers are able to at least incorporate the first one. Currently users have to turn Roomba and just see how long has elapsed! Kind of annoying and rather useless as you wonder, “why is it taking this long and how much longer”. Users also don’t have any idea how long a job takes, what room is next or what is already done.

After 5-6 months of weekly use, we noticed hairs would snarl the wheels, and despite removing the tangled hairs, one wheel motor died. Customer service was friendly and helpful in sending a replacement part (under warranty) in a few weeks. 
And now the Brava Jet mop is having similar wheel  issues.

After adding or modifying a zone the app tends to just spin and timeout. Sometimes the change sticks, sometimes it doesn’t. Modifying zones, even though keeping the same name can mess up the schedules as well.

It would also be nice to temporarily modify schedules cleanings without making a permanent change to the schedule or deactivating it. For example, if I’m home working in my office and want the roomba to clean everything in the schedule but there, it would be nice to be able to deselect it for the next cleaning only.

The clean base means Roomba can run 20-30 times between having to perform any work (replacing the bag). Considering the work value, it’s a no-brainer.  

iRobot sure is proud of there brand and the price reflects it.  Being nearly double the cost of the many value competitors seems extreme. The up-side is that Roomba has Alexa integration.

I had a defective clean-base (bad design with regard to the lid-lever that’s supposed to push the flow pipe into the bag).  It took months to get a replacement.  When that one arrived the electronics didn’t function properly.  I didn’t bother following up as, by the time the replacement had arrived, I had figured out a way to to wedge the flow pipe forward.

The design makes repair of common failures almost impossible.  Commercial products are designed to prevent repair and it’s an atrocity.  I’m sorry to see iRobot contribute to this massive waste and negative environmental impact.

I was worried about my very long hair getting tangled in it but it is easy to take apart and clean, and the hair doesn’t get tangled like it does in a traditional vacuum. It occasionally leaves hairballs on the floor like you would pull out of your laundry, but I do not mind that. At least the hair is all together and I just pick it up. It is louder than I expected but not disturbingly so. Definitely more quiet than a traditional vacuum. When it empties the bin I would say it is as loud as a traditional one.

This means that I come home every day to a house without cat hair flying around. Because it runs every day, dust does not even collect in high amounts in areas where Oscar can not get to as under the couch. I have to mention that he tends to get stuck after several weeks. Usually it helps to reset the robot. It would be nice if patches would be sent to fix some of the programming issues. 
To give a comparison: a vacuum robot is like a dishwasher. Nobody needs a dishwasher and probably does a better job cleaning dishes by hand than the machine.

I have found I prefer to have her vacuum smaller spaces so that it is nearly complete within a single charge. So while the main spaces run a bit longer, I will weekly place her in bedrooms and shut the door 15 min and done. This way the cleaning/charging cycle doesn’t take all day.  I have started to see where our long hair winds up under the rotating arm more now than it used too but it’s motor is still going strong.

 I am a little disappointed that although iRobot used our data to create the zone system for the newer robots they didn’t update our app system on the older versions to do this as they implied when I consented to them using our mapping data in the beginning. 

Now after years of bumping into things she has a little trouble fully returning home to charge but this is intermittent.

     1. Says he’s charging, but isn’t. 
     2. Does not connect to Wifi, so I 
          can’t talk to him. 
     3. Has trouble docking. 

To get him to charge, I have to wiggle him around on the connectors until it works. Sometimes that takes awhile. Not only is that making more work for me, but it also means if I’m not home when he stops to recharge during cleaning, he can’t finish the job because he times out. 

When not connected to Wifi, it can be several hours to several days before suddenly connecting again. We have checked the Wifi and nothing else in the house is having problems. 

Docking is just a mystery. When working 
right, he’s perfect. But he can sometimes end up in the strangest places, and just stops. Moving the dock to a different place has not helped, and neither has providing more light. 

I sent him in to be fixed once. He might be a little better, but it’s hard to tell, since it is all  sporadic.

I live in an 850 sq. ft. condo on a beach (lots of sand) and use this app with the Roomba i7. I’ve been using the scheduler to run Mon/Wed/Fri when I’m at work and fewer neighbors are around because it is much quieter than my Shark stick vacuum but noisy enough that I wear my AirPods w/ noise cancellation if I’m at home. The whole process takes ~1hr15min with no recharge or bin emptying. 

I’m a neat freak so I never have random things on the floor but the vacuum has no issues navigating around lamps, chairs, and pouf/ottomans that frequently move. The slim profile fits under all furniture and the overhang of my base kitchen cabinets. The mapping feature works surprisingly well as the exterior walls of my condo are at unusual angles (not 90 degrees).

The “smart” beta features are stable enough they should port over to regular users and there seems to be a good amount of machine learning because the one location that originally caused issues has not been a problem since the first few runs.

First of all: stop making the app completely dependent on AWS! There is no legitimate reason for this app to be “always online”, it should be able to communicate with the Roomba via an ad-hoc connection or at least WLAN. 

Secondly, there’s a minor yet annoying bug that causes the app to show that it’s not connected with the Roomba (despite being able to show battery level…) until you force close and reopen the app. 
Either improve the communication logic or give the user a refresh button so they don’t have to force close the app. 

Lastly this is a companion app to a premium product, especially when using the app for a high end model. As such it’s simply lazy this day and age to not include options to control the Roomba via Siri/Shortcuts. 
It’s trivial to hook into SiriKit and Intents so users can use Siri and/or the Shortcuts app to control the Roomba. 

Instead iRobot chose to go the extremely lazy route by hooking into IFTTT with basic and calling it a day.

-SIDE NOTE (if app developers even read these things)
I do wish that you could more refine roomba’s path. For instance, I live shotgun home in the south (long and narrow) and roomba’s base station is set up on a parallel wall. Because roomba’s path has it make sweeps perpendicular to its base station orientation, it makes 50+ passes working its way down hallways instead of just making 3 or 4 going up or down the hallway. 
The easy solution would be to put the base station on a perpendicular wall so it would leave its base, turn 180 degrees, and do long paths up and down the house. Unfortunately, I do not have a spot for the base station on a perpendicular wall, so it would be nice to have a setting to change roomba’s sweep pattern orientation.

It’s especially annoying that the top third of the first screen is occupied by a totally useless Roomba animation, while the useful big green button for stopping and pausing is completely gone. Now I have to locate a skinny little gray bar. 

Apparently this change was driven by the desire to include the new “Favorites“ section on the first screen. That is totally useless for me, however, as I have a non-mapping model. Yes, I know that it offers me the ability to create shorter routines, but what’s the point in that?

This app should be blown up and restarted from scratch.

iRobot does a better job along the walls because my Neato old version did not have the side sweep bristle back then. 
However, I do not like the iRobot diagonal path routes. They seem less efficient. 
Neato lightly bumps furniture much gentler then iRobot. 
iRobot did not return to base four out of ten times. I found him stopped in different locations for no reason at all when it should have returned to the base. 
Neato returns to base pretty much always to recharge to continue or when finished unless something has trapped it. Rarely. 
iRobot needs battery operated post to stay out of areas. 
Neato can be prevented in areas by using a movable magnetic strip on the floor. I like it as an option. 
I have even put it under a medium pile carpet and it detects the magnet barrier. 
The iRobot isn’t bad but I like Neato better.

Imprint link is oversold.  It does work, but not in a scheduling situation.  If you just press clean IN THE APP on either device you have the option of the vac telling the mop “I’m done here!  It’s your turn!”  This is great, but I’d like to see this work on the scheduled runs as well.  Not a deal breaker, but would be a nice feature.

I toggled the Roomba off last night, as my girls were sleeping on the couch after a movie night.

I now have to recreate the schedule on my iPad, which is absolutely maddening, as the application only runs in portrait.  This means that I have to enter data from Notes while my head is turned sideways.  My schedule is of course in Notes, as it deletes itself so often, I had to write it down in another program.

Here’s the “workaround” until iRobot app developers fix it.  Encountered in brand new Roomba e5. 

THE PROBLEM
1) Setup works fine until final step of “Roomba connecting to <network>. This may take a while”.

2) Audible voice says something like “Roomba is connected - ready for use”

3) But app is still HANGING at “Roomba connecting to <network>. This may take a while”.

THE FIX
1) KEEP original setup device (FIRST DEVICE) open with the iRobot Home app stuck at “Roomba connecting to <network>. This may take a while” as shown above.  

2) Download iRobot Home app to SECOND device —and LOGIN. The Roomba setup is complete, device is shown all working correctly (app is ready to setup scheduling etc).  SOOooo the problem was NOT your network — the problem is the APP!!

3) Now, go back to FIRST device — and DELETE the iRoomba Home app (yes DELETE it). 

4) Download the iRoomba Home app again and LOGIN. Everything is there — original setup worked fine. The APP has a BUG.

Favorites: 
I can create favorites, BUT, that is all I can do.  I cannot delete them or change them!  There are three dots that appear on the upper right corner of a favorite bar, but, when I tap on it the app closes.
 
Schedules:  
I can create them and I can turn them on and off.  BUT, I cannot delete them.  However, only 1 schedule, the first one I created actually runs.  When I switch on the others, they do no start.
 
Messages:  
When I check out a message there is NO WAY to get back to the App I have to close the app and restart it. 
 
Feedback:  
When you choose “Other (Explain below)” from the “Issue Type” category list.  There is no “Below”.

A couple of suggestions:
- the front of Roomba is black and it tends to leave marks on my baseboard.  I purchased a book tape which works great applied to the front of Roomba (the lover front; not covering the sensors); I change the tape every so often;

- Roomba plays a sound when job is completed; that sound for some reason does not play on my iPad;  only a visual announcement appears on a screen; a sound for Roomba on my iPad is selected in my settings but it does not play;
- I wish every Roomba, no matter what series, would be able to clean a particular room; I purchased two towers to block Roomba from entering rooms without doors, however, it would be convenient not to have to set out the towers to clean only selected rooms.

Call customer service had suggestions and none of them worked. I put Home station literally in the middle of the room in the house to see if I can find its way back. Never did. Super disappointed I paid a lot of money for that machine.

It does a great job in keeping up with all of the hair. Now with that in mind I do have to clean the iRobot weekly, but that is the least of my worries cause without it I’ll have to vacuum daily. It’s not so good on carpet, but hard wood floors is great, in which we have all hard wood floors. It’s a must to have if your weeks are hard going like my wife and I are!";"2021-04-27T15:14:27-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1012014442&type=Purple%20Software";"1012014442";91;"en";"POSITIVE"

I take very good care of her and make sure to clean her after every use. This may be operator error, but I wish she would clean room by room, rather than randomly vacuuming from one room to the next and back again. She has great battery stamina and although she does buzz about Willy Nilly, the floors are clean when she’s finished. I really want the mop!";"2021-12-02T10:00:39-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1012014442&type=Purple%20Software";"1012014442";90;"en";"POSITIVE"

So one of the help suggestions was to “ensure of mapping features is turned on” beware if you toggle the “mapping features” button off then back on it will delete your map. There is a pop-up that says you’ll delete your map, but it’s not clear that it’s permanently deleted.   iRobot does not have any kind of cloud back up for maps. So now I have to re-map my entire home. Having a cloud back up of the map seems intuitively reasonable.";"2021-03-29T12:12:32-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1012014442&type=Purple%20Software";"1012014442";96;"en";"NEGATIVE"

I’m still working through this with iRobot customer support.  With my availability being very limited when iRobot customer support is available, it’s taking some time.  But I wanted to warn people who might be in a similar situation.  Because it’s honestly probably not worth the time to work around this issue.
