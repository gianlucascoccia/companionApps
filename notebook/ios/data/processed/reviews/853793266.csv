EcoNet is like taking a step into the past. It constantly won’t connect to the phone app (no trouble with our old Ecobee), no support for wireless remote sensors (our old Ecobee had this and it was our fav feature. You could set it to use just the bedroom temp sensor to set the proper sleep temp). The EcoNet does support a single wired remote sensors which was incredibly frustrating to install and the thermostat software won’t let you select it as the primary sensor for specific schedules like sleep times). Also the forecast is constantly wrong (for instance 20 degrees off) even after we’ve reset the location 3x’s) 

Honestly I’m disappointed and this system needs some major updates to compete. If the development team can create remote wireless sensors support with the ability to schedule when that sensor is to be used I’d be much happier. 

Right now if Ecobee or Nest is able to add support for a “communicating” system I’d throw my EcoNet in  the trash and re-install our Ecobee. Rheem please allow this type of support, heck use it as a replacement option.";"2021-11-02T19:19:37-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=853793266&type=Purple%20Software";"853793266";209;"en";"POSITIVE"

I initially had numerous problems when I first configured with the “smart connect” option that switches between the 2.4/5 bands automatically.  When I reset my router to two seperate bands and connected it to the 2.4, all the problems disappeared!  REAL EASY to adjust temperature based on need.  Great scheduling tool.

1. It shows as “EcoNet disconnected” constantly. Sometimes it is connected fine and other times it is really disconnected. This matters because if the heater is actually disconnected it won’t report energy usage properly. Thankfully it does save the energy usage data, but unfortunately it doesn’t save the time. As a result of it has been disconnected for a week, when you reconnect it you get zero usage shown for 6 days and then a week’s worth of usage in the instant it reconnected. 
2. No data export available. Seriously? 
3. No indication of which heat source is being used, either in real time or logs.

The connection process was quick and easy.  The application help shows that it is geared toward Rheem’s hybrid unit with configurations for different combinations of gas and electric operation. For the gas only heater the only options are changing the setpoint and switching the unit to vacation mode. However, I have not found that changing the set point from the application has any effect on the actual water temperature in the heater.  After repeated testing, waiting a full day with plenty of water usage between test, changing the setpoint from 110 to 135 degrees always results in water from the heater that his 125 degrees.  I tried to contact customer service about this, but never received any response to my emails.  The application display indicates where the physical switch is on the heater, which becomes the maximum set point.  The blinking indicator light on the units gas controller provides more information than the Wi-Fi unit.  It’s odd that the heater can signal via the flashing LED when the unit is calling for heat, but this information is not passed on to the Wi-Fi  controller and the application.

Sometimes can’t control water heater";"With the gen 5 hybrid water heater, Rheem dumbed-down the UI so the customer can no longer see key diagnostic/status info like the water temperature at various levels in the tank. It would be great if these items were available in the app, but they’re not.

The app tells you even less. The hot water tank “availability” icon is useless. It’s tiny and there’s no documentation or help on what the various colors and levels mean. It may show a thin red line at the bottom. What does that mean? How much hot water is left? Any? After heating for a while, it’ll show a thin blue line.  What does that mean? How much hot water is left? Then it’ll show a thin green line. Same questions. Then it’ll show the green level halfway up the icon. Same questions. Finally, it’ll show the talk all green, even if the compressor is still running. Same questions? How am I supposed to know how much hot water is left, if I should switch the heater to High Demand or Electric mode, etc.?

Please, Rheem, if diagnostic/status info is recorded by the device and can be sent over Wi-Fi, please upgrade the app to capture and report it! That will be a vast improvement to the product.

Bug: The power usage report often shows twice as much power usage as actually occurred on a given day. Generally, that’s 1-2 kWh more that was actually consumed according to my energy monitor, which measures power drawn through the water heater breaker and, separately, the Mains. We also have a Tesla battery Gateway that measures total home power consumption. It agrees with the energy monitor. Neither sees the extra water heater usage the app is reporting. I think I know what’s going on: The app shows 0.2kWh spikes every few hours, which the energy monitor and Gateway don’t see. The compressor is not turning on during these periods. If I add all the 0.2 kWh spikes for a day, the total is the same as the difference in power usage reported by the app and my monitors. So the spikes don’t represent actual power draw. This bug has been reported in earlier reviews and should be fixed by now. But it’s not.

From time to time, the heater controls in the app don’t work. I’ll try to change the temp, but the indicator will go from orange to gray. Shortly after that the indicator will go back to orange and my temp change won’t have taken effect. Same happens sometimes when I try to change the operating mode, say from Energy Saver to High Demand. The change just doesn’t take effect. Then a few minutes later I *might* find the change did take effect, as if it was delayed. This is bad because the water heater could be left in an undesired state. It’s probably a communications issue.

Finally, I had trouble getting vacation mode started. I ended up manually lowering the temp to 65F, then turning increasing the temp via the Internet early on the day we came home. I’m not sure if this problem was due to the very poor and confusing UI or a communications problem.

Bottom line, this app needs a *lot* of work. It’s simply not up to modern standards for an advanced device like the Rheem hybrid water heater.";"2021-08-30T21:12:21-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=853793266&type=Purple%20Software";"853793266";559;"en";"NEGATIVE"

Don’t find it all that user friendly and seems we have to do way too much guessing on how to set things and make them work.  Sorry I downloaded this new version.    The app and the thermostat instructions leave much to be desired.

Update:   After using some I dislike this app even more.  If you override the set temperature, I cannot find where it says how much time is left on the override before it goes back to set temperature.  Old app showed this.   Much easier on old app to set and copy settings to other days of the week. AND, these little red and blue slide bubbles to change temperature is a joke.   They are very hard to move one or two degrees without these little bubbles jumping up and down moving erratic.  Please get rid of these and go back to the old way.   The dots and bubbles are way too small to easily control and they are mega sensitive.  Not a good way.  Go back to the old way.    PLEASE DO SOME FIXES ASAP.  THIS IS TERRIBLE.

My home is concrete cement so the heater is in a dead spot, I had to setup a dedicated Wifi AP via power link adapters in the garage for the heater to register with the apps. Also when the appliance loses Wifi connection with EcoNet it will wipe the existence of the appliance from its memory & require to add it in again when connection is re-established. This means all data that was entered & usage history are erased! The ability to remotely monitor the current temperature, setup heating schedules, and appliance health is great! I wish this app could provide more information on appliance’s health (e.g. amps/volts, heating element resistance, etc.) Also have the apps do scheduled checks of the appliance’s current condition & send a text. I can understand why this apps will allow only one user to be registered (security) but it needs a device manager for user authorization, for even changing devices can cause the apps to disconnect from the appliance and do a memory wipe. Also the ability to download the usage history from the apps to a user website account would be good option.

Kudos to Rheem for implementing water heater schedules - that’s very useful, and I presume I’m saving a lot of energy because of it. Like other reviewers, though, I’d really like them to bring back the current water temperature read-out that was in the previous version (v3?). That would be very useful for knowing if there is enough hot water to start a shower, etc. Also, like other reviewers, I’d like to be able to set a temperature lower than 90F. Why not allow completely off? If Rheem have a reason, they should let us know.

Finally, there is a typo “temprature” on the water heater page. The current version has been out for two months, and they haven’t fixed that? They need more QA. 🙁 But overall, if the schedules keep working, I’ll be fairly happy. To add that with an aftermarket device like the Aquanta would be much more expensive, with perhaps other problems. So this is workable, if not perfect.

BTW, I was able to add a new device just fine with iOS 13.3. But the way you need to switch to the EcoNet device’s own WiFi part way through is confusing.

The schedule for the EcoNet is by far the worse and if you change the thermostat manually and then update your schedule to reflect that change it won’t recognize what you’re trying to do and will revert back to whatever temperature it was set before that, super inconvenient if trying to utilize the schedule feature.  

Another feature I was trying to figure out is how to add additional users and ended up giving up just to call the support line and found out that you cannot add additional users to control the thermostat from the app. This is also a pretty huge inconvenience because even if you share your credentials for the account, the app will kick you off from the other devices it was logged into. Definitely would recommend y’all to either allow multiple logins from other devices for the user or add the feature for multiple users ASAP. 

On a better note, the app is still functional as others have mentioned and I had a pleasant experience with their support line.

It was not very clear if the time and temp set in schedule mean that at that time it will start to work towards that or if it will be smart enough to know that by that time the temperature should reach that setting. I don’t believe this is how it currently works but could be wrong. Anyway overall a decent experience and that is more than I could say about many other smart interfaces.

1-> Only one email per account.  You can have the App on multiple devices, but you can only get email alerts to one email account. 

2-> The water heater keeps disappearing from the App.  App is useless if you open it and the water heater is not there.  If you re-add the water heater, the new one has no data history.  In a day or two, the original water heater shows up and now the App is confused.

3-> If there is an alarm, only one person gets the email.  The other should get a notification from the App.  Hard to do if the App doesn’t see the water heater. 

4-> The water heater is very high tech and has to be looking at lots of data to do its thing.  The App only gives you temperature set point, operation mode, heatpump/element on/off status and estimated KWH usage.  Why not give us more data like actual hot water temperature, cold water temperature and inlet air temperature.

This app will not find your home network unless the SSID is being broadcast. If you are hiding the SSID for security reasons, you will have to change your network to show the SSID before you start configuration.

Once that is done, you will be able to complete the setup of the Rheem wifi module. If you want to see the whole process, there’s a set of screen shots on the Rheem website.

Note that you don’t get to create your Rheem account until the app has connected to your WiFi module and home network.

One notes are of improvement that needs to be done is that the charts are barely useful because they chart the monthly data by week showing total usage in a week rather than a usage per day number.  This means that the first and last weeks will always be drastically lower as they are partial weeks with as little as one days usage in it.  Also, would be ideal to see yearly data charted by the week and or day.  Even monthly would be fine.  Quarterly is just useless.

If I manually change the temperature setting on the thermostat there is no way to resume the schedule from the app. 

Can I pull up a history of how many hours my a/c unit ran yesterday, last week, or ANY history???  NOPE. 

The new slider bar to adjust the temperature is a good idea. But, it is difficult to make small 1 or 2 degree adjustments.  You have to try over & over to get it right.  The up/down arrows of the previous version were simple to use.  Bring them back or something similar. 

PLEASE look at the Nest app and see how a full featured app should work. 

My thermostats seem to have a mind of their own.  I have them scheduled to lower the temp at 8:30 pm to 76 degrees. But almost every day around 7:45pm the turn the a/c unit on, and it displays “Cooling to 82” even though the inside temperature is at 79.  It is cooler than the set point but the unit is RUNNING!!!!

That’s like a tv remote with only two buttons, that only selects channels up or down one channel at a time. 
Then if you change the mode directly on the water heater screen, it doesn’t update the changes on the app.  I shut down the app and restarted and it had my previous phone view/settings and not what was actually on the water heater control screen.  
Basically until an update that shows real time water heater status and temperature the app is useless.  
It almost feels the desire to get the water heater online was for Rheem to get feedback on their water heaters instead of customers having access to this data.

Intuitive - first guess on setting schedule, temp, etc. was correct.  I actually prefer the scheduling on this app to the Nest thermostat this replaced.
Simple setup, similar to most “smart home” apps.
Straightforward interface - simple to set temperatures
Flexible - Keeps names for your equipment across devices ( named mine “upstairs unit” and “downstairs unit” on my iPad, and they show up as the same on my wife’s iPhone.

NEEDS WORK:
App documentation - rather cryptic on some items.
Poor Alexa integration.  Connected mine, but doesn’t work for voice, but does work in Alexa app on a device.  Basically useless due to this.
Visuals - Great on the thermostat unit.  But the device App is generic bright white and has no “night mode” or “dark theme” on your device.
