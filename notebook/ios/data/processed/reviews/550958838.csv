Basically, to make sure everybody was safe, breathing and the rooms were still in one piece.   They were inexpensive enough, which is what I needed when I first built my business and my plan was to then upgrade to higher quality cameras with a hard drive for storage when a successful business was established.   These cameras have seen thousands of dogs in the past 5 years and I have no intention of upgrading them to a different brand.   I‚Äôve watched the dogs sleeping, listened to them snoring with the audio and given them a firm ‚ÄúNO‚Äù through the microphone if they were doing something they shouldn‚Äôt have been.  2 of the cameras no longer pan and tilt due to me dropping them on the cement floor, but they still do everything else I need them to, and no issues with connectivity or viewing on my devices.

Most recent update to the app has constantly caused crashes. The home screen shows a ""still shot"" from all 4 cameras from 2 days ago. Won't pull up records. Have to restart to view live constantly. Why'd you mess things up!?
Now on to the most recent camera update... JUNK, why mess up something good? Now the cameras drop wifi constantly and just to get it back working I've got to pull down the cameras to access the reset button on the bottom which is where the brackets connect to hold the camera. Pain in the.... on top of that there is no promise it will connect to wifi even after deleting the camera and starting all over again. I had no issues from my cameras for months until this most recent sabotaged update. I've been a customer over 2 years. Just bought camera #5 two weeks ago and I can't put it where it needs to go cause it keeps losing wifi and not getting it back or won't even let me see the live stream within the app.

2.  After recording dozens of videos of absolutely nothing, try deleting them. It‚Äôs a three step process for each and every one.  There is no way to multi-select all of them (or even some of them) and delete in bulk.  
3.  The thumbnails are often ghost images of a previous day, month, or even location!  So you can‚Äôt trust the thumbnail.  That means you have to open every video and snapshot to see what‚Äôs really there.

I could go on and on about the app itself, but those are the highlights.  If the goal is to sit in front of a monitor all day and watch, then this camera isn‚Äôt bad.

Use the app like normal. When you try to open it again it normally closes once the camera loads the video image. 
Open the app again but use the ‚ÄòSwipe up‚Äô from the bottom middle of your screen and hold it till the app logs in with your account and loads the video image.
