This led strip is bright and can change to any color you can imagine. The fact that you can control these LEDs through your iOS device is amazing and convenient, the setup works without hiccups. Open the app and press the on button and vuala the lights come on. You can set proximity sensitivity which means if you leave the place where you placed them they will automatically turn off and vice versa. You can also set a weekly schedule with time and day of the week you want them to turn on also awesome in my opinion. You can set it once and never have to worry about turning on and off if you know what you're schedule will be like. The only misleading thing about these leds is that they will chance color syncing with the rhythm of music and sound although in the quick instructions guide it says that it does. I'm sure that can be a quick fix with an update to the app. Other than that these LED strips are a must buy, very vibrant and unified leds";"2016-06-11T07:10:02-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=962662192&type=Purple%20Software";"962662192";199;"en";"POSITIVE"

11;1495358985;"hirnix";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id33311814";"1.1";3;"Here Is How To Make It Work:";"A little experimenting and the phone and Watch app will work:
iPhone App (⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️):
A. ""All on"" will only display the right color setting for ALL bulbs if you program the colors under ""scenes"" this way:
1 - select ""+"" to add a scene
2 - select your color choice (either from the spectrum or by uploading a picture of a color you want - perhaps the color of a picture on your wall - then go to the bulb icon at the top right and select only the bulbs this scene applies to.
3 - name the scene
4 - press ""back""
5 - repeat for other bulbs

B. Apple Watch App (⭐️): 
No Bluetooth pairing with the bulbs required. The Watch app will draw info from the iPhone. 

If you see no buttons on the Watch app, pressing the center of the screen for the three options ""all on,"" ""all off,"" and ""lighting"" will do just that and it will do it for the color scenes you set up using the steps above. 

⚠️ Using the third option, ""lighting,"" will turn the bulbs on and reset the color options. You might only want to use this option if you need bright white light for all lights. 
Other than that, as long as you ignore the absence of buttons displayed for the first two options on the Watch app, it will work just fine. 
‼️ Your iPhone app has to be running in order to be able to use the Watch app. That's nonsense, but perhaps they'll fix this with the next release.

It's not ideal, but remember, you didn't pay the premium fee for Hue and got very affordable bulbs. I've used by bulbs for over two years now and my friends have marveled at them and I enjoy being woken up gently with light before the alarm goes off.";"2016-12-03T09:10:48-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=962662192&type=Purple%20Software";"962662192";312;"en";"POSITIVE"
