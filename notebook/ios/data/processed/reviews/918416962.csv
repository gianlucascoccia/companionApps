4. Open App, tap the menu access (white horizontal bars) at upper left of screen. Tap ""camera list"".

1. Older cameras can't connect to 5G networks, only slower ones.

1. App needs ability to refresh/reconnect the connection without going into settings or having to close the app. 
2. App needs the ability to adjust brightness from the view screen. 
3. Move the flip screen buttons from the view screen to the settings/setup.  Why would you ever want to do this past the initial setup? I keep accidentally clicking them and it is a pain to get it back to normal with the app constantly crashing. 
4. Please provide remote access to the camera so that I can record to an external device with other monitoring software.  If someone steals my camera, they've taken the recordings with them.

Easy to use app.  Camera setup via the app is really easy.  No directions of how to setup recording but not too hard to figure out. (Advanced Settings).  When using sound and presets the screen image gets small to fit the buttons and doesn't go away unless you deselect the option, should be able to hear without  image getting small.  
External, remote recording option would be nice (cloud storage?).

Once the camera was connected I was able to pan, tilt, listen, etc. But when I tried push to talk it crashed and I had to reconnect the camera. 

Another thing that would be nice is if you are using sound and you are in full screen landscape, the overlay should disappear. Takes away bottom portion of the screen. This is removed when muted, why should it be different otherwise?

I also don't see how to use the two way microphone or listen in which is listed on the apps capabilities. Somewhat puzzled right now as to how they say things about the app and product that aren't true.";"2016-04-06T13:55:02-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=918416962&type=Purple%20Software";"918416962";97;"en";"POSITIVE"

But the app keeps shutting down & the volume for others to here don't work well for the two way which is weird because initial set up volume is loud. I've been waiting for there response on when app will be updated but they have failed to reply. So unfortunately I'm going to return. When I did contact them before hand about setting up the camera they replied quick but then stopped. Setting up camera is not easy. It's a bit frustrating. Had to set up with a android first then it would except on my iOS";"2017-05-31T09:45:51-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=918416962&type=Purple%20Software";"918416962";111;"en";"NEGATIVE"

One minor inconvenience when I unplug the camera and move to a new location the music plays all over again and I have to set up all over again. Unless I'm missing a step.  
Overall I'm happy with the camera. 
The app works well for me I can't think of anything I'd change or ask for in an update to the app. 
Night vision mode is excellent, I've had no drop in signal at all and the frame rate is very good.  
Purchased the 1080P HD Wifi version for 69$ from Amazon.";"2016-02-17T18:52:31-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=918416962&type=Purple%20Software";"918416962";107;"en";"POSITIVE"
