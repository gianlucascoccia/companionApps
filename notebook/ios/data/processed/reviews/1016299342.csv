 1) No Apple HomeKit integration 

 2) If you are an Apple user, you cannot add the device to your home automation scenes. (ie, automatically turn on when I arrive home and turn off when I leave home, etc) 

 3) No Home Screen widget to see current air quality stats 

 4) No integration with Siri Shortcuts app or commands. (they have this enabled for Alexa and Google, so they clearly are just ignoring Apple users) 

 5) The setup process to connect the device to your home WiFi is not intuitive and more cumbersome than other apps. It also does not support 5ghz WiFi. 

 6) The app requires your exact location, not a close location. That’s a huge privacy concern! Why do you need to know my exact location? Anywhere within a 1/2 mile is close enough for the outdoor air quality levels in the app. You don’t need my pinpoint location. 

 7) No notification options. Other apps send you a notification if AQI, PM2.5, VOC, etc goes over specified levels. Blueair sends me nothing. 

 8) No firmware update button in the app, so you cannot force it to check for updates. You have to wait until it decides to check on its own.

9) No way to save or export the weekly/monthly data.";"2021-06-05T06:35:38-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1016299342&type=Purple%20Software";"1016299342";237;"en";"NEGATIVE"

In short, it works and provides loads of control and information. I can only speak for the latest BlueAir HealthProtect 7000 series connectivity, but I’m impressed. No need to open any manuals to set it up. However, first the app attempts to connect via Bluetooth to the unit using my iPhone 12. This is confusing since the unit WIFI icon just flashes and no progress seems to be happening in the app. I didn’t realize that a Bluetooth connection was necessary. It took several minutes before something started happening. I never did see the unit in the phone Bluetooth settings. But it made a connection and immediately I was prompted for the WIFI credentials. From there it was smooth sailing. I recommend to be patient while the Bluetooth connection is automatically established between the app/phone and the filter unit. I cannot complain about the overall experience and the app certainly delivers in terms of data offered. I also use a “non-smart” BlueAir Pro L, two non-smart IQAir Health Pro Max units and two wifi connected Molekule Air units. Overall I prefer BlueAir primarily because they move so much more air at much lower power and noise levels.

The app is self explanatory,  easy to use, and does what it needs to do. It’s basically a remote for the machine, or like a thermostat that lets you schedule days and times of use. Just what I need!

This unit isn’t silent on the third level it’s very loud, the
Purpose is to clean the air and although the first setting is hardly audible , the advantage to higher settings is to remove vocs that are present without seeing the readings on an app  by just smelling them .

Reasons for the return: Primarily the LOUD 680i FAN.  Other reasons: the improved aesthetics, the improved premium LCD display (on the 70i series), the improved 4% speed steps for the new fan(via the app), less fan noise and, pleasantly surprising, an app experience I rate as 5 stars with the 7470i vs a lesser quality experience with the 680i.   

What worked great was a much easier initial device setup with a Bluetooth link to find and add the 7470i device to the app.  Once added to the app all app features worked well on my Mesh network and I see and control the device on the 5G band.  Compared to the Classic 680i setup, the 7470i was super easy.  FYI setup was done on an iPhone 12 Pro max.

The effect of this is that it can take almost 30 seconds for the machine to receive commands from the app during setup. This is a special complication when you need to confirm the presence of an indicator light on the machine from the app (a wrong answer will send you straight back to the beginning of setup).

Once the machine is setup the app is actually really interesting, giving real-time updates of air quality in your house and reacting quickly to your commands. 

Still, my machine only supports 1 WiFi band (2.4ghz), an increasingly obsolete band as we move into faster and faster wireless computing, which is yet another technical hoop to jump through. This app needs some updates but the operation is smooth if you can get to the core functions of the app, and there’s almost no reason to own the higher end machines if you can’t use the app for real time sensor information, imho.";"2020-09-19T08:39:40-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1016299342&type=Purple%20Software";"1016299342";185;"en";"POSITIVE"

p.s. comments from Blue Air rep condescending and off base. the 605 does have a wifi chip and the only way to turn off the insanely bright led (nobody would want that in their bedroom) is to go through a long process of downloading their ultra glitchy app, create a blue air account, connect the 605 to wifi, and use the app to turn off the led. outrageously stupid process, which in the mean time gives these morons all your personal info. sry man you can’t polish garbage.";"2021-03-30T21:41:58-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1016299342&type=Purple%20Software";"1016299342";149;"en";"POSITIVE"

Con: 
1. The google assistant integration like a joke, but since this feature is released recently and I hope it got improved.
2. Both the app and unit itself seems can’t calculate fan speed very well. My fan has a weird pattern: fast on 1, slow on 2, faster on 3, and fastest between 1-2! Worst of all, when it between 1-2, either set by app or on auto mode, it make a very loud whistling noise along with the fastest speed. I have tried several ways and don’t know what to do to fix it.

For this I need to install an app on my phone???  Why not use the LCD touch screen on the device?

Oh, you require my location to run the app?  For an air filter??  Ok, I’ll temporarily unplug my wifi router from the internet and turn off cellular data and then allow location services for the app. After I turn off the bright light, I’ll delete the app so it can’t send my data to the Internet. 

Oh, *now* you want my email address???  For an air filter???  Dream on. 

I deleted the app and covered the light and the flashing wifi icon with electrical tape. Problem inelegantly solved.

Even so, I may never be able to use the purifier in my bedroom because of the remaining light from the screen and the inability to invoke night mode without the app.  (Seriously, does one need to use the app every night before bed to turn on night mode?  Does it have a darkness detector?  Why can’t I tap an icon for this?)

I feel an urge to return this pricey 7470i device in protest of this customer-hostile behavior.

Please consider the experience of your customers who do not want an Internet-of-things device.  The perpetually flashing wifi icon is both comical and unfortunate.  Maybe draw a line through it instead of making it flash at least?  Do that and replace the germ shield icon with a night mode icon and you’ll be golden.

The app won’t let you connect to the device unless you are on a 2.4ghz wifi. While mine has that band, it is not selectable via ios, or possible to make it selectable router side.  Therefore this app is completely useless, and this “intelligent” air purifier is no better than my 75$, low/medium/high true hepa devices.  The device, like any decent IoT wifi 2.4ghz device, should have an adhoc AP used to configure it. Even my 7$ smart wifi bulbs have that.  This is garbage. 

It’s also pretty sketchy that they won’t let you add a device unless you allow the app to track your location via gps.  Invasion of privacy much?

Update:
I figured out how to temporarily disabled 5ghz wifi on my eero mesh wifi, which i verified by using an AP scanner and watching the MACs representative of my wifi SSID go from 2 available to 1.  I then rebooted my phone and tried the app again. Same error. “You have to be connected to a 2.4ghz network”.  I tried this many times. 

I thought something must be cached inthe  blueair app data, so I deleted it and re-downloaded it.  When prompted i put in my email address in the app and click next, at which time I’m presented with the account registration/creation dialog(instead of password), that I finished an hour ago. So i try to register again and it says my email address is in use. I have no registration emails from them either. So i cannot log into the app, or register, and one must(along with giving their location data via gps) to add the air purifier. Even if I could, i’d probably still get an error about not being on a 2.4 ghz network, which i am.  

On a side note, during registration if you decide you mistyped your password in the first field, and type it again, they delete everything you typed in the password confirmation field, so you are forced to type that again as well. Isn’t that nice of them to add that extra step for us?  Thanks!

If I could rate this app and the company negative stars, I would.";"2021-04-04T14:03:41-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1016299342&type=Purple%20Software";"1016299342";377;"en";"POSITIVE"

I borrowed a Samsung Android phone and surprisingly the 7770i was added to my account with no problem. I thought this would automatically add my 7770i to my iOS blueair app but it did not even though I used the same account. 

How do I fix this? I only use iPhones.

Update: After spending some more time with the app I was able to get the Blueair connected to my WiFi. The app and the device have significant lag between inputs.

1. Setup account in Blueair.com if you had not done so. Do not use the Blueair app to create the account – go to the Blueair.com directly using your web browser of your choice. Use a strong 
unique password (12 alphanumeric characters minimum with special characters).
2. (Optional) Setup separate wifi network for IoT (Internet of Things) and setup a unique WPA2 password. Ensure you are using 2.4GHz frequency (not 5GHz).
3. Download Blueair app on your smartphone (not tablet or other mobile devices). Sign in with your new Blueair account.
4. Turn on wifi on your smartphone. Make sure you are not running any VPN (Virtual Private Network) and that your wifi is not set for “private address”.
5. Make sure you are on the wifi network where you want the Blueair device to use. Have the wifi password handy and ensure the SSID broadcast is on.
6. Plug in the Blueair device and wait about 2 minutes.
7. Run the Blueair app on your smartphone and follow the instructions. Look at the wifi indicator on the Blueair device very carefully, since the blinking rate can be difficult to interpret.
8. You will then enter the wifi password when prompted in the app.
9. It will error and press the wifi indicator for 4 seconds (count 1001, 1002, etc) to reset to manual mode (when instructed by the app).
10. Connect your smartphone to the CLASSIC-xxxx wifi network (or whatever network the app tells you).
11. Enter the wifi password again in the app when prompted.
12. The Blueair app should then indicate that the setup is complete (it can take up to a minute).
13. At this stage, your Blueair device is now setup in your Blueair account at their cloud service.

Once the above steps are done, you can then setup another mobile device (like a tablet), install the Blueair app, log into your Blueair account, and see you Blueair device. You no longer need to use your smartphone to manage your Blueair device via wifi connection.

Next thing is to set your location (and only have the location active when the app is running) and reset the filter so that the Filter Status is correct. See the FAQ in the Blueair app’s Help, which takes you to the same Blueair.com web site Support page, for more info.

Note that these steps are for Blueair for iOS v3.0,9 (3). Note also that it took me 3 tries to finally get the Blueair device’s wifi and app to work correctly. If you need to reset the Blueair device’s wifi to start over, just press the wifi indicator on the device for 4 seconds, and it should then blink in its “new start” mode.

UPDATE: The app appears to reset the Blueair settings. When you run the app, ensure you double-check the Auto, Filter, and other settings to ensure they are set the way you want them. For some reason, my app keeps putting the Blueair device in Fan mode instead of Auto, and the app forgets that the filter replacement setting was reset. As others commented in the Apple App Store, the Blueair app appears to be unstable.";"2020-12-22T21:22:16-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1016299342&type=Purple%20Software";"1016299342";551;"en";"POSITIVE"
303;6741635322;"Colo Admin";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id490730773";"3.0.10";1;"Impressive how horrible the initial experience is";"I have to say it’s really impressive that a company selling products that cost as much as a new iPhone are able to make the onboarding experience as incredibly bad as Blueair has.  I just received my new $900 680i and was excited to plug it in and get purifying.  90 minutes later I just hope it lives up to its air cleaning reputation and that I never have to interact with its app ever again.

First issue; in 2020 their devices still can’t utilize a modern WiFi standard or hidden WiFi networks.  It will only work with 2.4ghz networks, the network has to be broadcast, your phone has to be on the same network during setup, you have to give it location access just to add your new device.  Well, I only had 5ghz enabled, and I have a network specific to devices I don’t trust, which my phone is not typically on.  Additionally, iPhones generally prefer 5ghz, so even dual mode is insufficient.  I had to create a new 2.4ghz network (or could have switched my 5ghz to 2.4-only, permanently for this device), and then join my phone to it, just to be able to tell this thing how to connect to WiFi.

Second; didn’t work.  You get stuck at the choose your device screen, or the pre-requisite list screen.  If ANY prior attempt at enrolling the device fails, you’ll never get past this if you do not also power cycle the purifier; they don’t tell you this anywhere, so you end up in an infinite loop of errors and timeouts.

Third; manual setup doesn’t work.  I can join the purifier’s custom-connect WiFi network, but the app refused to recognize I had done so.

Finally, I power cycle it, start over, reconfigure my 2.4-only broadcast-enabled WiFi network, and 90 minutes later I’m able to get the app to actually work and enroll the device.

Considering this a win, I peel the initial setup label off the top of my device, and the sticker they use leaves all the adhesive behind on the unit.  Are you kidding me?  I just spent $900 on an air purifier, and 90 minutes configuring this ridiculous app, and my final interaction is going to be using Goo Gone to scrub adhesive off my product?";"2020-12-11T07:45:00-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1016299342&type=Purple%20Software";"1016299342";381;"en";"POSITIVE"

1. The Signup Screen is a disaster. It creates an account but just does not to take you to the next screen. You are left wondering what the hell is going on. After a few times trying to create an account, it has actually created an account the first time, but the app just sat there refusing to show a response or going to the next screen. I checked by logging in with a browser and with Android App (which pops up with a get host name failure?). I suppose the server confused the app. 

2. The Connect screen is another disaster. It goes up the point of entering WiFi password and stalls there no response. The Classic 480i blinking endlessly. I pulling the plug and retrying several times I just gave up. 

3. The device lights are another disaster. The circle around the WiFi is different from WiFi symbol, Blinking and Pulsing are different - Really? You should fire your usability expert if you had hired one in the first place. 

All you had to do was blink it when wifi is not setup and light it when it is connected and turn it off when it loses connection.

First, thank you for investing in updating this application to ultimately improve usability and functionality.  I most appreciate what appears to be your intent to enable multiple automatic schedules for the same device so that different days can have different schedules.  

The new code does have a key issue for last 2 versions that I want to make you aware of.  When trying to program a schedule, the pop-up time-Of-day scroll wheels are visually a blank white box with no text or graphics at the top left of the screen.  If you mimic what you would normally do to program a start or stop tie, you can see that some of the functionality behind the GUI is there but it is impossible to successfully program.

The app frequently becomes stuck on status ‘Connecting...’ with a grey background. This occurs after the phone is locked. It’s 100% reproducible every time. 

If anyone else is having this issue, one workaround is to force-close and reopen the app each time. This can be done by double pressing the home button and ‘Swiping up’ on the Blueair app. 

EDIT: Old setup issue below. SOLVED: Seems like the unit doesn’t play nice with virtual wifi networks. After disabling that setting on our home Netgear router, was able to complete the initial setup fine after that. In Blueair’s defence, this specific issue is in fact mentioned in an online support article. 

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

Spent 30 minutes trying to get the new 280i and 480i to work our fam WiFi network. Both using the standard route and via ‘classic-connect’ manual option. 

As an engineer myself the next will try setup a dedicated 2.4ghz network without security. I have no idea why it can’t connect to my network which is just a regular WPA2 802.11n network. 

It seems others here also struggle with WiFi. A suggestion to the dev team : maybe test with wider range of customer routers and setups. Real world conditions in the lab can be far from representative. 

In conclusion we have *many* of other smart IoT devices on the network, from a wide range of manufacturer, all working fine. The issue appears to be BlueAir.";"2018-06-18T08:21:14-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1016299342&type=Purple%20Software";"1016299342";248;"en";"POSITIVE"
