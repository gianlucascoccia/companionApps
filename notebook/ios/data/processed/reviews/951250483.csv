I got a new puppy and this has been a life saver for crate training. I can see if she is awake without getting out of bed and without worrying that I will wake her by checking on her. Best feature for me is Night Vision. It is not the best but you can see if your pets eyes are open but not much else. 
Things that would make it better: Two way communication!! It stinks that I can't hear anything. You can talk to your pet but you can't hear them.  I also wish you could zoom in the camera.  

The setup of the video and app were simple. You don't need any tech skills.I set it up in less than five minutes.  I think they could also do so much more with the App itself. A message or discussion board where owners can talk and ask questions would be helpful. I would like to also send a private messages to other users. 

I also tried PetCube Video Camera. PetCube you can two way communicate. So you can hear if your dog is crying or in distress. But a big thing it doesn't have is night vision. The apps and setup for both are very similar. The best feature that PetCube has that Petzi doesn't is that you can view other people's video feed with their permission . So you can play with someone cat or look at dogs in shelters.  You can have others exercise your pet with the laser or just admire. Both have similar video quality and similar in price.";"2016-07-09T19:51:52-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951250483&type=Purple%20Software";"951250483";270;"en";"POSITIVE"

It shows that it has discovered the network, but when you put in the password to log in, the screen blanks out and goes back to the iOS home screen. when you open the app it is still sitting on the login screen, but you cannot do anything because the every time you try to put in the password the same crash happens.

However, the whole thing is very disappointing, especially since I had to wait well over a year to get the actual device. That in itself wouldn't be a huge deal if it actually worked as advertised. Two main problems. First, the app doesn't consistently work. Out of 12 tries, it worked twice. The other ten times it buffered, then closed with the error ""session couldn't be started."" Really? It took over a year to get the thing to market and it doesn't even work. Seems like these issues should have had been worked out before starting a funding campaign. 

Second, the camera resolution is simply awful. Beyond awful, especially considering the resolution on iPhone cameras these days. Not at all how it was advertised on the indigo go campaign. 

So in essence, I paid $100 for an over priced treat system that doesn't always kick out the treat. (The first time, the treats stayed in the little recess.) Of course, since the app rarely worked, I really didn't get to test the treats. 

Save your money. Don't buy the Petzi and the you won't have to worry about the app that doesn't work anyway.";"2014-12-23T18:47:50-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951250483&type=Purple%20Software";"951250483";234;"en";"POSITIVE"

The new update makes the video lag HORRIBLY! It was bearable before but now it's awful! I see green spots on the bottom while it distorts the image of my dog due to an awful lag! I dispense a treat even when I am home to see how late the video is and it is very slow! I am very disappointed, which is why I am changing my review from 4 stars to 2. I loved it when I first bought it, but the slowness and bad video quality is driving me crazy. I bought this to see my dogs and I'm lucky if I get a few peeks at them in between the lag/distortions! What a shame! Won't be recommending anytime soon. Bad job, Petzi.

I bought the camera off Amazon a few weeks ago. You need the camera to use the app because the purpose is to see your pets and give them treats and talk to them. Installation was a bit difficult for me because it kept getting disconnected but it seems to work OK now. The camera quality is pretty good and it lets me dispense treats for my fur babies! Overall I am satisfied with the camera and the app. :)";"2015-11-11T13:17:14-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951250483&type=Purple%20Software";"951250483";213;"en";"NEGATIVE"

I can see them and treat them when I am out, and then take pictures to post on the social site. 
Worked great from the 
set-up, and the pets love it too.......especially my Cavalier King Charles!
Best buy ever 🐶🐱🐾";"2014-12-31T21:45:26-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951250483&type=Purple%20Software";"951250483";56;"en";"POSITIVE"
