1;4960573402;"Robb Miller";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id117044926";"1.4.7409";4;"I love music";"I bought this Jam symphony so I could listen to my phone‚Äôs music library out in my shop, hoping that it would be louder than my phone‚Äôs speakers.  I was NOT disappointed.  This speaker thumps!  I am very happy with my purchase.

The app is ok. What I mean by that is that it gets the job done.  Any dissatisfaction is an opportunity for improvement, right?  What bugs me may be of no significance to anyone else.  But with the possibility that others may have similar thoughts about it and the potential for improvement, I‚Äôll share:

1. Connecting to WiFi was fairly easy with the user manual.  We upgraded WiFi years later and without the manual, it was a little more difficult... not impossible though.  Having the instructions engraved or imprinted on the unit would be helpful.

2.  I do not use a streaming service.  Having to go to the bottom of the list each and every time to play from my library gets old.  It would be nice if it could default to my selection when I run the app.  If I ever purchased a service, I could always back out and make a new selection.

3.  It would be really cool if I could cast it to a TV screen and use watch music videos?

4.  It would be cool if I could use it as a speaker(s) for my TV.

5.  It would be cool to use the speakers through my home stereo receiver,

... just ideas.

Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase and would buy it again.";"2019-10-17T06:34:45-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1106812948&type=Purple%20Software";"1106812948";262;"en";"POSITIVE"

2) some mornings I get up and try to connect my iPhone to the speaker system and it will literally take 4 minutes. It won‚Äôt see the Group. Or it will see the Group and take forever to connect.

It is however by far the best VALUE, and it provides 95% of the quality at literally 10% of the price OR LESS!!! Jam allows you to stream over WiFi from the app from various services, including both HiFi (Tidal & Deezer) plus Spotify (most popular in USA, where I live), HiFi Local Tracks, Plus the ability to connect via a DLNA server, all of which (outside of Spotify, who is supposedly experimenting with offering HiFi) allow you to stream at HiFi quality (FLAC, AIFF, WAV equivalent) while apple airplay limits Apple Music and local music to ALAC and limits everything else to MP3. The technology used to power the sound distorts at the highest volumes, which I have used only once to see if the distortion actually happens. It does. I have never lived in a single family house with these, that is the only setting under which I would even consider using the full volume due to the power level and sound level it has at lower volumes, under 75% I hear no distortion, and I rarely go above 50% or 55%. I got my Jams a little over 2 years ago, since then the firmware has been updated to iron out all the kinks to my satisfaction. Early on setting up speakers as well as remembering speaker groups and volumes was not great, but presently I no longer run into those issues. This is such a tremendous value for the budget audiophile that I rated & reviewers the app, which I normally do not do. Go Jam!!!! I believe the target audience is audiophiles on a budget, they sound best with high quality resolution music!!!";"2018-09-16T17:28:11-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1106812948&type=Purple%20Software";"1106812948";293;"en";"POSITIVE"

It can‚Äôt connect to Google Home either. If it could do either of those, you could have complete home automation without having to use your phone to select any songs.
