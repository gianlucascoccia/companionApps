This app, which controls the AirPatrol unit increased functionality as far as settings on the heating unit compared to my old system. It seems responsive, fast and stable. I have not experienced any loss of connection so far (only a week).";"2019-02-12T00:50:18-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=503563831&type=Purple%20Software";"503563831";62;"en";"POSITIVE"

It’s no small chore to have so many configurations preconfigured for you, which enables them to provide an interface that is both useful and pleasant to work with.

The portable unit I am using was just released, and I was fearful that I would not find a template that work with it. But after if an email or two to their customer support, I was up and running and could not be more pleased.

Their approach to this complex problem is a unique one, and I appreciate the time and effort that must’ve gone into getting all of it ready for prime time.

So, kudos to this vendor, and many thanks for a job well done!";"2019-08-05T09:50:54-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=503563831&type=Purple%20Software";"503563831";135;"en";"POSITIVE"

It's not clear if this is a server issue tied to AirPatrol or if I'm having wifi issues in my house.  Everything else on my wifi appears to be working when I have this issue.";"2018-05-23T19:20:42-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=503563831&type=Purple%20Software";"503563831";68;"en";"NEGATIVE"

I was hopeful since the new version seems to recognize the unit by point remote control at the airpatrol. 

Unfortunately it doesn’t successfully send commands to the unit anymore. Ugh.";"2021-01-29T10:46:39-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=503563831&type=Purple%20Software";"503563831";49;"en";"POSITIVE"
