I unplugged it, I’ve turned my phone on and off, I have unpaired and now I cannot even pair it back up again. I have no idea what else to do. The hardware works fine but it seems I am unable to connect it back up to my device. I’ve reached out to customer service and still have not heard back.

It’s always the life of the party and everyone always wants some for themselves. However, I am not alone in my concerns for how the app is just poorly designed and cared for overall. Some days the panels work and some days they don’t. Sometimes I’m required to connect my phone to WiFi for them to turn on, other times I’m not even connected and they’ll still turn on. As well, the desktop app also has its bugs. When screen mirroring, sometimes the panels will just freeze and stay stuck unless I turn off completely and turn back on again. Sometimes I just can’t get it to connect. There’s just too many “what if’s” involved. Paying $500+ for led panels that you aren’t sure are going to work 100% of the time is quite ridiculous if you ask me. That’s a lot of money, and I think with that, should come excellent app quality. There needs to be more time and effort placed on the app and panel connectivity because it’s too spotty at the moment. If you guys would take time to go to Reddit as well as Facebook, you will see all the complaints and troubles that people are having with your product. Please take us seriously.

I’ve got other smart lights and devices and none come across as befuddling as this app does. I’ve updated to the latest app. I’ve checked and triple checked all of the menus. I’ve swiped, tapped, double tapped, multiple finger tapped, heck I’ve even deleted and re-downloaded the app and it’s still problematic. For starters I can’t for the life of me figure out how to delete rooms I’d previously created. I can’t drag lights to the trash. I can move them from room to room but that’s kinda pointless when I’ve moved twice since owning these lights and no longer have most of those rooms. It’s generally a very plain app that attempts to be simplistic but overly complicated the process of renaming, moving, or creating and deleting rooms and lights. It’s also very inconsistent when it comes to hitting some of the menus as they will sometimes refuse to do anything. That leaves you second guessing as if to if there really is or isn’t an option to access there.

And I wish there were an option to change the animation speed. It would be nice to be able to slow some of them down for a more relaxed feel and to make it less eye-catching/distracting.

There’s a frequent problem with adjusting the brightness of grouped devices, Colors or Scenes, After tapping the (teardrop-shaped) icon to access this adjustment screen, there is no visual response to this selection, requiring REPEATED restarts of the app to finally access this screen. Unless you’ll be using automations ONLY, be prepared for a frustrating experience of using the app to adjust Colors, Scenes, Brightness or change any of these options for a group (I have 4 lights max in any given room) of lights.  

I’ve submitted two requests for assistance with connectivity problems with the Shapes (Triangles) product. Both responses came two days or more after I submitted a request for help.  

I got these specifically (and pretty much only) because of the embedded Thread support, but the daily problem with adjusting the lights combined with lengthy response times to requests for help, make this purchase not work the trouble.

I have to constantly delete the light bulb from my device setting and reset it (doesn’t always reset) and reconnect. Usually that’s still a hassle and can still flicker or most likely not connect at all like right now. Writing this review because I can’t connect my device again. 

Home app integration slow when turning on or off. 

Apple Watch home app control also slow or not recognizable. 

The new feature that came out a day or two ago for the light to turn on and off by recognizing my device proximity when I get home or leave does not work.

Therefore I was stuck buying Nanoleaf Essential light bulbs. It’s okay, you can ignore the unnecessary RGB colors if you want and use them as tunable white bulbs, right? Not so fast.

The Nanoleaf app makes it hard to remove RGB presets and replace them with tunable white presets. I was able to make presets for 2400K, 2700K, 3000K, 3500K, 4100K, 5000K and 6493K - Nanoleaf doesn’t do 6500K.

So I Googled what to do, and it turns out I deleted the Home App from my iPhone which is essential here. So I downloaded Home, and made sure that Keychain was enabled. After resetting Home, and doing a hard reset on the panels, my phone was able to discover them finally. Once that happened it took me approximately 5 minutes to set everything up including linking to Alexa. Easy stuff. 

The app is key to these lights especially if you skipped on the remote like I did, since I plan to rely on voice to control. And the app once connected is really fantastic. Changed my entire outlook on these panels and now I’m obsessed, especially with the rhythm addition. 

Tons of customization...limited only by your imagination to be truthful. Other than the clunky and very specific setup, the app is pure gold. It’s because of the setup that I docked a star, but other than that it’s perfect. 

I see some people questioning the positive reviews as fake...please let me assure you, I in no way work for this company nor do I have any reason to write a fake review.

It is more like 3.7 stars rt now. 

FOR STARTERS, the initial instructions are not adequately step by step to connect the smart device app with the squares. 
Once I sat back and thought more mechanistically about it, then I sorted it out myself. But it wasn’t well presented—stepwise—in the initial app-to-unit link-up. 
And nobody wants to have ten more minutes sucked out of their day when the company should have already worked this out better w/a focus group and some trouble shooting with the initial app setup is needed. 

NEXT, probably the touchscreen buttons on the squares are hard to know when you are pressing hard enough or too hard. 

NEXT, why not make the connectors at every side, symmetrically? Then the options for patterns are greater. 

NEXT, the instructions in the box are fairly (overly) scant and lack a reasonable amount of detail for initial set up. 

LASTLY, simply downloading the app went well but then it requires I register twice. The first registration didn’t work. When I tried later to sign on it said I didn’t have the right email and/or password. After verifying both (I had only done them just twenty minutes or so earlier) I finally gave up and re entered the  initial registration, again. 

Now that it works I am impressed. For a product that is clunky as far as ease of initial setup, app registration (and the above problems) it is still move and stylish. 

The price point is a little much also. 
But that’s a longer ‘editorial’ that I’m not in the mood to write at the moment. 

Yes I would buy it twice.

THOUGH THE ADHESIVE MOUNTING STRIPS INCLUDED WILL NOT ADEQUATELY SUPPORT THE NANOLEAF CANVAS - EVEN UNDER IDEAL CONDITIONS.
I don’t know how they could have possibly messed up such a simple thing.

ALSO SUPPORT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO REACH. 
Which kind of puts the whole 2 year manufactures warranty into the “useless” category.

The nanoleaf App is a disaster. Though there’s little choice but to use it for setup. 
Once I got everything linked to my HomeKit I haven’t really had a problem. 
But the scenes and colors are all messed up if I get the scenes via the nanoleaf app, which is really the only option I’ve found. They work, but it’s a careful balance to ensure that you control as much as possible through the Apple Home interface. - which unfortunately is a bit limited for the Canvas.

It’s a cute product. The adhesive strips failed, under perfect conditions within 36 hours. The manufacturer has been utterly unresponsive. I only received a “we will escalate this” auto message/effectively, b/c even though there was at some point a person’s signature - with no actual individual contact information or phone number; after attempting to reach them through various means my response was “call me [my number included]” and they never did. BUT I ONLY RECEIVED ANY SORT OF REPLY *AFTER* I INITIATED A COMPLAINT THROUGH MY FINANCIAL INSTITUTION.

Had the mounting system not failed (or if I had initially used something better - I’ve discovered that the Velcro type adhesives, including those for mounting framed artwork to walls) sold at hardware stores are wonderfully effective.

Once the mounting system failed, and thank you to my cat for being the cushion that the control tile and several other’s landed on *sarcasm*. 

The company is fortunate that this happened in the middle of the night and I was too asleep to immediately drive her to the vet, or photograph the fallout. Including the panels that actually broke and I cut myself on. Cat seems okay. But you never know. And depending on how a**inine Nanoleaf is going to be about not contesting at this point the demand for a full refund, since 4 months of non-response - and I did “locate” a number for them, not that it did much use but added proof to my claim that I have done everything possible to contact the manufacturer.

Even Apple tried on my behalf to facilitate communication with the manufacturer, since I purchased it through the Apple Store (which was utterly not something Apple was responsible for, but Apple is utterly awesome in that way. I do my best to purchase all on my electronics through them even the non Apple brand ones, not only due to the good pricing; but also b/c they have never failed in being exceptionally helpful above and beyond their actual responsibilities, especially for non-Apple products.  SO KUDOS APPLE; and to my financial institution for dealing with a very much non-standard case for full refund).

All that being said. Even though the panels did suffer in the fall, the ones my cat did not “catch” didn’t survive; but the surviving ones, although on some colors they are clearly not as evenly bright as they were prior to ‘utter failure of included mounting system’ they do a nice job of being mounted (as opposed to floor or desk lamps) lighting for my bedroom. They respond well to Siri verbal commands, and HomeKit automations, and at 100% on pure white, they are certainly brighter than any other lighting in my bedroom, and a lot less of a hassle, both in that they are mounted on the wall and I don’t have to physically switch anything on. For an approximately 10’ x 15’ room, in the near vicinity they are more than sufficiently bright for any task requiring good lighting (reading, sewing, makeup application, etc.); for the room as a whole, at the aforementioned setting, I only require additional lighting if I need to do or search for something very detailed at the other end of the room. (And I like things bright-bright, as in I use 1000+ lumens lightbulbs for my desk lamps, not easy to find).

Mounting system failure aside - which is very much a manufacturing fault. 
Appearance wise, I expected them to look a bit more solid, they’re reminiscent of shoji screen paper like  appearance. Not so much as they are pictured on the manufacturer’s site.

I highly recommend using a level when mounting them; and I can see how maybe you can get 12 or so squares setup into some interesting pattern - although if you want it to look proper, it does require a level, pre-marking things on the wall, etc. I cannot imagine a full wall display setup, even if it’s square to square; it just takes a lot of precision to get them placed just right (and not misaligned or “sloppy looking”)

The included connectors, are ... cheap p.o.c., but they *do* work; although it takes care and attention to get everything in place, as you can’t pre-connect, and then mount. Although I was somewhat surprised that when the mounting system failed, and it all came crashing down, only one of the plastic connectors was in any way damaged. 

BUT THE APP IS A DISASTER, and HomeKit integration, while - once you get it up and running - is fantastic, there is a limit of what you can do - in terms of the more fancy stuff, including (I’m assuming, I’ve never found a way to make this actually work) music/TV integration - which seems to be the Nanoleaf App failure. 

THE APP REALLY IS UTTER CR*P.

I’m hoping their newer product line is more solid; it seems from the specs they did pay some attention to the fact that the canvas just failed to deliver.

THOUGH I SURE AS H*** AM NOT GOING TO TRUST ANY ADHESIVE STRIPS THAT THEY INCLUDE FOR WALL MOUNTING. 
That and the new heavy-load Velcro-type mounting systems, aside for actually being strong enough to hold up very large items (I’ve a 3’x4’ heavily framed artwork, that’s hanging just fine on my walls with zero issues); it’s also far easier to reconfigure how everything is set up.
