With the introduction of the streaming Music product Apple continuously tweets and screws with Remote App Library management and overall utility of the integration. I am really disgusted and won’t go into the more granular inconveniences but please just leave it alone! My iTunes library has over 10,000 songs that were transferred from CD’s or purchased through iTunes.

Only way to reconnect is by deleting the remote and reestablishing the Connection. It works for a short while and then the same thing happens. 
I use this with Hegel music products, one of the best, if no THE best airplay receiver. 
I have been using iTunes and airplay for more than 10 years. It has steadily gone downhill as iOS and intoxicating profits drove Apple’s focus, while OS X steadily went downhill. 
The dreaded Apple permissions debacle is enough to make a grown man cry. The only person this is going to keep from copying the music is the Apple computer owner. A thumb in the eye for being an Apple enthusiast. 
I have owned most everything Apple makes, including Xserve. 
It used to be fun to work with Apple. Now it’s a hair pulling ritual. For the first time since I started using Apple, I an thinking of alternatives.

No offense Apple, but I don't feel like paying ten dollars for a firmware update on a device that is currently a dedicated AppleTV remote with other functions that I'll replace with an iPad in a few weeks. 

I recently had to reset my iPod Touch, and forgot that my iPhone had graciously updated all of my apps with 3.0 versions over the past few months. I thought I had lost my 2.0 apps forever. Sure enough, I had lost most of them, as each app I tried to redownload informed me of my incompatible firmware version. I crossed my fingers and found the Remote app. I was afraid that I would have to use my phone as the dedicated AppleTV controller until the iPad was available to purchase, or pay a few bucks for a firmware update on a device that will some be relegated to a single use (phone for on the go, Classic for long plane/train rides, shuffle for working out, Touch for being a couch potato). Lo and behold, the app downloaded, the list and scroll version, not the finger point version of Remote. I was so happy. I can continue to use my touch as a dedicated remote.

You can crawl under a rock into a hole in the ground, so long as you're within the range of your wifi network, you're good.  It lets you control several different libraries, which is good since i have both a Mac and a PC, and the responsiveness is on point (no long loading time).  My PC is slow as hell and often freezes with a few applications open.  Even when my computer froze, I was STILL able to use the remote fully and the response was just as quick! I couldn't do ANYTHING ELSE on my computer, but I was still able to control my iTunes through my iPod, crazy right?  Album covers and artist names under songs are a plus, esp. when you have different songs with the same titles (I don't know why Apple hasn't done that yet for the iPod Touch's regular music app).A couple of things they should add (not complaining) are the ability to launch iTunes through the remote, a cover flow view and the ability to listen to your computer's iTunes on your iPod via headphones.";"2008-08-01T05:02:47-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284417350&type=Purple%20Software";"284417350";258;"en";"POSITIVE"

I noticed that a lot of people on here was having a problem with this app and having it communicate with their computer. I have a PowerMac G4 and was suffering from the same problems that everyone here appears to be describing. I found that it all generally boiled down to having the bonjour services working properly. I personally found that the mDNSResponder system service was not active. Now what I ended up doing was turning off my G4. Once it was completely off, I turned it back on while holding down the shift key on my keyboard. What that did was force a ""refresh"" on the running services that goes on on your Mac. Once it starts up it will say safe mode under the Mac OSX words. Just log in and you should be prompted to allow a system service called mDNSResponder to run. Click allow and now you should restart your computer to get out of safe mode and all should be well with this app and many others. This takes a little while to perform but if you do this correctly you will save yourself hours of headaches.

I have been using the remote app for many years without an issue via with the AppleTV and the iTunes PC on ethernet to my router.  Foo all these years I give it 5 stars.   BUT:  I recently replaced my router and decided to just use the Wireless-N since it is wicked fast.  Thats when the trouble began:  I had hideous problems with configuration and reconnection.  The Apple Remote app could only respond with ""Home Sharing Must Be Enabled"".  After numerous reboots and reloads on my appleTV, router and iPhone, I reverted to the ethernet connection and THE PROBLEM VANISHED.  The problem is probably within the wireless network config side of the AppleTV.  And the Apple Remote programmers are probably scratching their heads.  With the Apple TV on wireless, the wireless remote app has significant problems connecting.  With the Apple TV on Ethernet all is well and the remote app works like a charm.  If your router is a jumper cable away from the AppleTV, try connecting the AppleTV to the router directly and see if your remote app problems go away.

I guess my biggest complaint with this application is when it's used along with the Apple product Airport Express. For instance, my roommates and I are sitting around in our living room taking turns playing music from each of our iTunes collections to a set of speakers hooked up via Airtunes and each of us are using the Remote application to trigger songs out of our own iTunes libraries. The problem arises when one person pauses their songs for someone else to play something. There is an error message that appears saying that the remote speakers are already in use by another user. Now I realize that this error message might appear every now and then, but the problem I have is that the error message only appears on the computer screen and not on the iPhone. So then we are left to wonder why our song isn't playing, only to have to go into our room where the desktop is set up in order to dismiss the error message and get on with playing the song.I believe in order for this application to really advance further than it already has, the error message needs to appear on the iPhone itself so you can dismiss it without having to go into another room in order to play a song to airtunes.";"2009-06-20T22:28:45-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284417350&type=Purple%20Software";"284417350";230;"en";"NEGATIVE"

Although satisfied with the Logitech, it pales in comparison with the iPod Touch and the Remote app.  With a dedicated music server PC with an iTunes library of almost 100 gigs of music, the remote app gives me the same control over my music as if it was on the iPod itself.  From anywhere throughout the house and large patio, I have immediate access to every track in my library.  There is no latency in using search or volume control and the display of songs, playlists, and album art is simply icing on the cake.

I noticed that when you try to select a movie chapter it won't let you from Remote :-(  Is there some way of adding this feature?When this APP first came out, it would open iTunes if not already open.

The reason I said that is because recently I sold my iPad 2 to help out my Dad to able to afford one so that he has something to give to my mother on her birthday at a great price.  I just wish I didn't need the money so much that I could have just give to her myself.  Anyhow to make a story short, she loves having an iPad.  Now to my review of this app. The reason I'm glad that I don't have an iPad anymore it's because I can finally have a chance the full benefits of my MacBook Pro.  I just recently downloaded the iTunes 11 on it and its been great.  I also downloaded the Remote App on my iPhone 5 so that I can control iTunes with it.  Then, as I was playing around with all the setting on this remote app I discovered that I can now simultaneously connect iTunes with Apple TV, Airport Express and Bluetooth Jambox.  Of course to do this trick is I have the Jambox connected via Bluetooth first, then connect Apple TV and Airport express using the Remote App.  And the result is awesome.

The issue is with your network! I'm a tech guy and have used remote with at least five of my friends' iTunes installs. When my group of friends' have parties we give everyone with an iPhone access to the network and Remote access, so that way everyone can add songs to the mix! We've never had issues at the parties, and I've never had issues personally. Now many of my friends are engineers and admins, so we have properly configured networks and computers.

On a related note, a great prank as you are driving away from a party but are still within network range is to switch the music to something totally inappropriate for the party. My friend has a country album of Shania Twain's in his library that was added by his wife. At my friend's Halloween party, after a night of Halloween music and heavy rock (Tool, Type O), I switched the track to ""Man, I feel like a Woman!"" as I drove away. :)";"2010-11-18T18:47:30-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284417350&type=Purple%20Software";"284417350";193;"en";"POSITIVE"

Let me first say, this worked immediately without me having to configure anything! I do networking for a living, so here is what you need to know about this app... It will work if your itunes library is connected via hard-wire to the wireless network as another reviewer said didn't work. You just have to make sure that you don't have seperate networks. The app connects using Bonjour. If you are on Windows, this should have been downloaded with iTunes. If you are on a Mac, well of course, this is already installed! I have a mixed OS environment at home, it works with all 4 of my iTunes libraries, both mac and windows, and all of them can see and connect to the airport express I use for my remote speakers. My central router and gateway is a linksys router (The same kind I am betting more than 80% of you have).

Raise or lower volume, skip songs, all without going to a computer. I use three AirPort Express units to dispatch music to different zones in the house creating an immersive experience. Each AirPort Express is connected to a signal sensing amp (it wakes up when audio is sent to it) which in turn is connected to speakers. Using wi-fi and the iPhone I now control iTunes from anywhere in the house. The experience for my guests is magical. Well done Apple, thank you.A note for future improvement: I firmly believe that when using Remote, double clicking the Home button should bring up Remote controls not iPod controls. To arrive at my musical collection the double click of the Home button is the quickest path to take.

It has changed the way I listen to my music, as I'm sure it has done for others. However, I don't want to call this a flaw, because that is not what it is, but there is something key that is missing here. With the release of the iPhone 3GS, you now have the ability to activate what you want to hear with ""The Voice Activation"" feature. This technology is phenomenal. However, and I know I'm not the only person who has over 1000 artists, 10,000 albums, and well over 100,000 songs in my iTunes library. If you are one of these people with a very large library, you know it can take some time to find what you want. Yes, the search feature works pretty well, but it's not as fast as some of us would like. If able, the addition of Voice Activation to this app would make Remote completely perfect.

I'm running Vista and I didn't have to configure my firewall at all. When controlling my room mates xp pc I just turn windows firewall off then turn it back on when I'm done. We don't need the firewall when using the remote because we're not on the comp.

But - I have an alarm set (using the native iPhone alarm app). If I'm watching Apple TV and the alarm goes off, even if the screen is locked, if I tap the alarm to snooze, it stops the video. Seems like the alarm app should at that point register and respond to any touch actions. The user has to respond to the alarm before they go back to using the remote anyway.

When accessing video in the iTunes library using this application, I do not believe you have the ability to switch to full screen mode.  If you want to remove the iTunes 'gray frame' (for lack of a better term), you must physically do this at the computer itself.  I have my Mac wired to my TV and stereo from another room.  When choosing a video, it would be nice to be able to play it in full screen mode using simply using this remote application as opposed to making the necessary keystroke on the computer.  I hope such an enhancement could be offered in a future software update.If ""Remote"" already has this functionality, please let me know.

Sometimes there will be a slight connection issue but It is fixed by going to the list of things to control and reselecting what it was trying to connect to. 

The reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because it doesn't act like a music app.  What I mean is, I can't control the volume with the device's volume buttons and I can't pause or skip to the next song from the lock screen with a double tap of the home button. I realize that permanently being able to access from the lock screen would require an active connection which will greatly drain the battery but since it's already maintaining an active connection for a certain amount of time, I think it's completely reasonable to enable control from the lock screen during that time.

The most notable absence is the support of AppleMusic. It would be nice to be able to use Remote to browse the Apple Music library like you can with iTunes and not just your see your own library. And then you can't subscribe to podcasts, buy music, etc... Oh, then of course there are the new bugs with the ""Now Playing"" queue and how some music you can add and some you can't. (That's always been a mystery, and that's aside from the interface being rather cryptic in the first place.) Clearly Apple wants you to buy an AppleTV to use that for playing music because of course you need a TV device to play music.
