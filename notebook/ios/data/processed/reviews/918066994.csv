Took a while to get here.";"I have been using this app and the Panasonic system for quite a while with both the cheap cameras that come with the HNB600 hub and the newer Homehawk KX HNC800. The cheap cameras aren’t much to speak of but the Homehawks are great. 

The app has given me fits. The network configuration has been challenging but with the latest update everything is working great with really no configuration. I have removed all port forwarding and it is working fine. 

The system is quick to alert you when a sensor alarms. The sensors all take batteries so you have to periodically change them out but it isn’t too frequently. 

After the last update I am very pleased. 

It would be really nice if the developers made an Apple Watch app that could just change the arm state of the system. I have the disarm key fob but an Apple Watch app would be more convenient. 

Also it would be nice if there was a way to make the hub chirp or beep when a door is open in the at home alarm state. That way I could know if my kids went out the door without having an alarm.";"2019-08-19T05:44:03-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=918066994&type=Purple%20Software";"918066994";199;"en";"POSITIVE"

I have bought Panasonic Home monitoring security system from US back to India.

Model : KX-HN6002

I created a new Apple id to download the 'Home Network' app to access the US app store.

I successfully setup the cameras and I am able to view my cameras remotely in my office.

I have a problem - As claimed by Panasonic and other users the system does not send notification/alerts to iPhone when we have motion detection in the outdoor cameras. But, I am not receiving any notifications/alerts in my iPhone (IOS 9.3.4).

I have executed all the necessary actions required to get the notifications.

Panasonic FAQs/communities/forums does not offer any technical help with regards to this problem.

Currently, I have logged into US apple id account in my iTunes just to make sure I don't miss the notifications from the Home monitoring system - but this did not help.
I was going through a thread If you're not getting Apple push notifications - Apple Support .... !!

Do you think I need to setup the TCP ports in my router ??

Or Is it due to my apple id (USA) and my iPhone (bought in India) I am not receiving the notifications ?

Wat could be done from Apple to resolve this issue ??

But instead of just complaining, I did a little research and found that they modified the way the app works, and you need some changes made on your router. These changes were necessary for better security and performance, not just to screw with people. Once that’s done, everything was fast and smooth sailing for me. 

For those too lazy to look:

1. Set your hub to a static IP address. 
2. Forward ports 62000-63000 on your router to the static IP you assigned to your hub.

I've updated this review to reflect software and firmware changes. 

The companion app for the Panasonic Home Monitor hardware is decent. Remotely connecting to the system is an exercise in patience as all connections route through their cloud but it has improved greatly over the past few months. 

The programming logic has improved greatly over the original version. Now, multiple layers of scenarios can be enabled.

Once I go out of range and onto data then the problems start.  I usually have to close and open the app between 4 to 15 times before it will come up.  If you get a trip alarm, it could take you up to fifteen minutes to see the camera.  I say fifteen minutes because that is the point I flatly gave up.

You must invest in a hand set because it speaks what was tripped where the phone only beeps and you have to read it.  The handset must stay within the hub range though.  

The point I became really upset with the system is when I went to enter a sixth door sensor.  When I went to register it, it picked up the identity of a certain sensor already registered.  When it tripped, the handset (operating on the hub) correctly stated which sensor it was.  My Iphone on the other hand, said something else.  I deregistered them and reregistered them and always the same.  I called Panasonic about it and they had me reset the hub at least twice, meaning I had to redo all my set up work.  The Panasonic tech has not been able to resolve my issue.  He said he would look further into it and get back to me.  He did call back but was still unable to resolve the problem and said he would do more research and call back.  I have not heard back from the tech support, so I am returning the sixth sensor.  They say the app will take up to 50 devices, but I have only been able to get 5 to work.

I tried reregistering one last time.  The handset spoke the wrong sensor and my Iphone said yet another.  The app does NOT SYNC with the hub!   That was the last straw, I am sending it back and not adding over five sensors.

Like I said, if you use this for inside the home security, you should be fine.  If you want to access from away, then you will be very disappointed in the system.  I have well over $500 spent and I really wish I would have gone a different system.  If it worked the way they said it should, it would be great.  I would highly recommend NOT investing in this system at least until they get some of the bugs worked out.

One last thing to add here.  If a device doesn’t work right, you have to send it to their warehouse in Texas at YOUR own expense.  Make sure to test it fully so it can be returned within the thirty days or so of purchase so you can return it to the vendor.";"2016-04-07T21:14:52-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=918066994&type=Purple%20Software";"918066994";475;"en";"POSITIVE"

This quirky app finally, after 1 1/2 years is usable.  Before it would take forever to connect, and often fail, making it nearly worthless, esp remotely.    Now it connects fast and with much more success.  Went from 2 to 4 stars!!";"2017-04-17T06:00:12-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=918066994&type=Purple%20Software";"918066994";48;"en";"NEGATIVE"
