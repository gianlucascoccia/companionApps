However with all of the incredible capabilities for controlling devices once you get them set up is extremely empowering in so many ways! Not only can you observe the status and control so many devices throughout your home and property but you can do it from virtually anywhere! One of the most amazing aspects of this app and VeraPlus Controller along with the devices you add & control is the incredible technical support staff! I’d have to rate this product support group as the most responsive and helpful support I’ve ever dealt with, by far! Quick responses to my original question to setup the controller and for all my follow-up questions to setup a Z-Wave deadbolt and PIN codes with start & end dates & times. Once they explained what I was missing, the regular operation of these tasks are easily repeatable and flawless in their performance. These tools along with their responsive support team are Game Changers!

With the help of the Vera Support Team, we were able to replicate all the Nexia functions successfully.  These folks know what they are doing and helped lots in getting my new security controller setup.  The Vera interface is quite different so it’s been a learning experience.

But it suffered from endless zwave connection problems, a corrupted database, and intermittent connectivity. The Vera Customer Service is good,  it it cannot make up for a fundamentally poor quality product.

The final straw was that I discovered that many devices that are listed as compatible are Not...On,y older firmware on these devices is supported. To make the device work you must downgrade the firmware to older, obsolete versions. (Such as Aeotec Switch 6) This is complicated, time consuming, error prone, and a pain.

You should also know that Vera does not support logical operations or variables, so if you want a lamp to be on if BOTH a particular scene is active and a device is on this is not possible. You CANNOT use the dimmer brightness setting from one device to set the brightness on other devices.

Yes, there is a tool called PLEG that you can use to implement some logic, but it is less than obvious and I found it couldn’t do the types of things I needed (such as synchronizing brightness levels for multiple lamps.)

The summary is that Vera has great customer service but a terribly unreliable and outdated product.";"2018-10-10T19:16:48-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=787203434&type=Purple%20Software";"787203434";202;"en";"NEUTRAL"

How about a screen with obvious but not overly stated buttons to switch modes and an info icon for each mode that you can tap to  get to deeper settings in the modes? The scene configuration is ok but still a little clumsy. Sadly I'd say that the app version of the scene configuration tools is better than the web UI version. That's not saying much. Vera needs to work on the whole scene logic set up anyhow but that's outside the scope of the app review.

Another problem I see is that when you attempt to change the state of a device (e.g. unlocked to locked) the app seems to show a spinning progress indicator that never stops unless you exit and reenter the app.

Old 1/5 star review below:
***********************************
I’ve been a user since UI4, I was currently using UI5 before upgrading to UI6 to use this app.

Huge mistake. Previously, I used iVera - which is a great app. After upgrading to UI6, I am forced to only use this app.

My big problems with this app are:
• This app and new UI6 require arbitrary complexity. Please do not enforce this - require min length, not special and caps/numbers. I would like to use long sentences as password.
• App requires re-login every 24h or less. Old system kept username/password for a month. When users need to access the systems once or twice a day, this requires entering a password almost every time.

Hope this app gets better, or iVera updates to support UI6/UI7.

My biggest complaint is the app is just slow. When you launch it your forced to wait for it to update. Your devices are hard to find and you have to navigate menus to find things (honestly it would be better and faster if they were in one big master list sorted alphabetically then what they currently have). When I launch the app I have a clear goal in mind (e.g turning a fan on) and they certainly do not make that process easy. Bottom line is that when I'm in bed it's simple to just get out of bed and turn the fan on with the physical switch than it is to use the app which shouldn't be the case. 

The other problem is when you turn a switch on, it immediately switches off, and then a short time later switches back on - in other words they are waiting for confirmation from the controller before they show the desired state of your switch.

This is not a set and forget, between this App, Veralite and the UI updates, you really never know when things are going to work.  We had all the issues that most are complaining of.
Recently, the APP stopped working completely. We logged out and back in like we usually have to do but after a few days called back into tech support.  They were Aware of the issue that will be fixed in the next APP update.  So for now, the app is going to be broke for at least a few months.

Support stated that don’t provide updates for when things break or will become available again, so “you have to just keep trying and once it’s fixed you’ll be able to log in”.

The beta testing this company does obviously isn’t working and the app is too unstable to use even when it’s up.

Also like others have mentioned, I was getting temps in C and not F. That is also not the fault of the app. I found in the forums where I just needed to manually poll the z-wave device from the Vera lite. After that all was fine. The app works well.

I can't figure out how to add devices via the app. Don't know if it is possible.

The iOS app feels and functions like a wrapper around a universal web interface...that is to say, slow and janky and non-native. All-in-all, a pretty abysmal experience.

Needs input from professional app developers, designers and UI specialists who speak English as a first language.

It looks slightly better than what many of the smaller zwave controller vendors have managed to produce, but that's also a very low bar. It's still very far from approaching the level of polish seen in the app from smartthings – which is of course native to iOS ...and not a web interface dressed up as a native app.

The forum has a ton of example code to use and learn from.   In the beginning you don’t need to do this but after a while you will love the fact that it is an option.  

Support has been very responsive whenever I need help.  I have no idea why there are so many negative reviews.   The reality is home automation is not always simple and you need to read forums occasionally to fix things.  

Bottom line is this product has been giving me rock solid performance for years. I have over 45 device ids and over 50 scenes and it just works.  Everything from integrating my existing dsc alarm system to full Alexa control over devices and scenes, to energy monitoring.

Previously, non-Retina iPads displayed iPhone/iPod apps at a classic 480x320 resolution, upscaling them with a “2X” button to a larger, chunky-looking 960x640 window. On a non-Retina iPad 2 or iPad mini running iOS 7, the apps are now displayed at the larger size by default, but use the higher-resolution text and graphics seen on the Retina iPhone 4/4S and fourth-generation iPod touch, while removing the ability to shrink to “1X” size. Retina iPads, however, still give users the choice of toggling between 1x and 2x mode.

Now, on an non retina iPad on I0S7 the username and password fields display, but the bottom with login, create account is cut off. in fact you only see half of the Vera Logo and you cannot login. Also when the app loads the logo is in portrait but then the login screen shifts to landscape, which is odd for an iPhone app, unless this is supposed to support landscape unlike the old vera mobile app.";"2014-02-11T11:53:45-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=787203434&type=Purple%20Software";"787203434";188;"en";"POSITIVE"
