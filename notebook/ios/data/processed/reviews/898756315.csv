I haven’t had any trouble with it. The app’s interface is simple and straightforward. It has everything you need and nothing more. You open the app and see the door right away, then one tap to answer. Snapshots and history are just as easy to access. The settings menus are a bit complicated, but as a technical person I prefer having more options than less. Once it’s all set up, you never need to mess with the settings anyway. 

I had a Ring doorbell before this and it was okay, but not great (both device and app). At my new house, the contractor installed a Control4 doorphone and I had him replace it with another DoorBird because the C4 intercom app was not nearly as good.";"2020-09-08T07:26:44-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=898756315&type=Purple%20Software";"898756315";143;"en";"NEGATIVE"

- There is a bug in its push notifications on iOS. The doorbell and motion alarms become permanently silent after switching the phone to Silent Mode and then back to Ringer mode from the side toggle. The only way to have the push notifications have sound again is to go into the DoorBird app settings and toggle the Activate button for each notification. This needs to be done each time after the phone is switched back to Ringer. I have now missed so many doorbells as a result that the whole point of having the DoorBird in order to open our gate on demand, has substantially diminished in utility for us.

- The camera view doesn’t load when the app is opened by tapping on a push notification - which is the typical user experience when trying to respond to the doorbell. You actually need to tap on the camera view button in the app (bottom left corner) to get the camera view to refresh and display.

- The app UI and UX look like they haven’t  been updated for about 10 years - the app is in a desperate need for a refresh to a more modern interface.";"2021-02-10T11:02:52-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=898756315&type=Purple%20Software";"898756315";208;"en";"NEGATIVE"

1) The app doesn’t bypass your phone’s silent mode. So if you leave your phone on vibrate and you don’t have it right in front of you at all times, you miss deliveries constantly.

2) The app is EXTREMELY slow. Even if I’m staring at the phone and immediately click the notification when the doorbell rings, it still takes 5-10 seconds for it to load video footage. If you want to try to talk to the person, it takes even longer. We basically never try talking to delivery people anymore because by the time it actually gets your audio to them, 9 times out of 10 they’ve already left.

I wanted to like this system, but those two absolutely killer flaws completely ruin it. 2 stars because it’s nice to have video footage (when it loads) and it’s nice to be able to buzz people in when you’re not home (if you don’t miss the notification and it doesn’t take so long to open they don’t leave first).";"2021-05-24T11:58:15-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=898756315&type=Purple%20Software";"898756315";191;"en";"NEGATIVE"

1) If somebody rings the door, it takes approx 30-45 seconds to pull up the video in app if you click the notification ASAP. It then takes a little while longer to trigger the lock. In total it can easily be a minute which often times leads to the delivery driver leaving.

2) The UI on the door doesn’t say ANYTHING to the person buzzing the door. It basically just goes to the main screen. The person is clueless as to what is happening, so they sometimes leave.

3) Because the notifications are just app based, it only shows as a banner in your phone and if you don’t have vibrate/volume up you very often miss the notification. So the deliver driver leaves.

4) The app has a lot of bugs. It often glitches, crashes and overall is very slow to operate.

I’ve missed a lot of packages because of this app, and I’ve got to say I rather just have the usual phone call when somebody’s at the door to let them in.

138;2101551044;"CShell7568";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id222190527";4.2;2;"Device kinda ok, support... what Support???";"If your a professional installer looking for Wi-Fi enabled solution as an alternative to the “R” word product, that can be integrated into Crestron, Control4, etc; this is about the only option.

And if your a pro, the best advice I can give you is to completely open the system up and pre-Configure it, do firmware updates and make certain you have it all working 100% before taking it to a client Home... make sure if it’s not being offered on a T&M basis, you allow for at least 4 hours of install time to deal with having to stage the device and deal with Support issues... if you don’t stage it, expect to start he Project on day and drive back to the site 1-3 more times before it’s all working.

Doorbird Support is an absolute joke.  Once you actually reach someone (which is the biggest challenge, if it’s one of the main people in Germany your in luck.  If it’s someone at the US office, they may be helpful or they will just send out new parts.

As for product shipping, evidently they don’t have any US distribution.  So when you place an order, be prepared for limited communication; just like with Support.  When you track the packages, they will appear to have been prepared for shipment but never actually ship... then 10-14 days later they  appear out of no where.

As for the hardware itself, once it’s working, it’s great.  As for it being a plug-n-play like their biggest competitor, not even close if your taking about a retro fit product that requires Wi-Fi.

I’ve installed the door stations and Door chime boxes.  Neither worked out of the box as advertised and required updates to get going.

The instructions they come with are often based on a newer or older firmware version so they don’t exactly correspond with the device your working with.

All that said, if their support didn’t take between 48-72 hours to respond to a Support ticket and they didn’t make their phone contact nearly impossible to locate; these little issues they have would not be a huge problem... the problem really is with their support.  Whether your a DIY or pro, expecting someone to start an install and have it take a week or more to complete, just because Support is unresponsive is completely unacceptable.

As best I can tell, if the people within this company spent half much $$$ on staffing their support team as they do on trade shows pimping their products to builders, architects, and other trades; they could probably grow their business quite well organically.  But with so many people like myself bad-mouthing the company, they seem doomed; at least in USA.

So... like I said before, if your a professional integrator and need a Wi-Fi enable solution that can be integrated, this is it.  But if you can get a wire to your device, pay no attention to the fact they have a $300 solution and spend a couple hundred more on something from a better competitor that can be integrated.  I can assure you that $250 saved on hardware will be far superseded in time spent by your technical dept making this thing work.

Other important notes that aren’t obvious until you install one:

- Drivers for Control 4 do not support video to a mobile device app; only the C4 Touch-screens

- Though most doorbells ( at least in US) require a 24vac power supply, these take a 12vdc, so be prepared to be digging around looking for the pre-existing doorbell transformer and getting a DC transformer plugged in Place.

- most doorbells are wired with like 22 gauge or higher wire.  So if the original doorbell transformer is too far away, it’s quite likely you’ll suffer voltage drop which will result in unreliable operations... especially when the night vision kicks on.  While the right solution is probably to run a new wire, which is usually impossible without major hole cutting and mess, you might try the high-powered Optional  DIN rail power supply they offer.";"2018-01-18T07:11:48-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=898756315&type=Purple%20Software";"898756315";679;"en";"POSITIVE"

Like most, i do not want to be on notice every minute. Just record the activity and i will look back if needed. Nope. You cannot do it. Either you get a notice and then it records, or you turn the notice off and you get no recordings. I would not recommend this product.

In my location, wifi is unreliable outside the house since there is a plaster wall that blocks much of the wifi signal.

An additional bonus of this system is that one  gets faster connectivity when the iPhone or iPad is on the same LAN. Connectivity from the outside internet is also robust, but of course depends on the network speed of the ISP.

The unit looks very nice - I got the more expensive flush mounted version. It's a bit of an effort to pull the wires and cut out the opening for the unit, but it's worth the effort.

Installation, connection and commissioning was speedy and problem-free thanks to the accompanying documentation and worked at the first attempt.
I made the network connection (contrary to the manufacturer's recommendations) using a dLAN to Wi-Fi access point from the adjacent garage. The connection is rock solid and so long as you are satisfied with less than 25 frames per second, is also very stable (even with a smartphone on an LTE network; via EDGE it judders a lot, but the sound is still loud and clear).
The image quality is excellent, even in total darkness with the switchable infra-red lighting. It also almost achieves the 180° viewing angle. I mounted it at shoulder height. It des not make a video recording yet, but that will happen soon. A still image with the date and time is saved for events, and the history can be viewed in the app.
I haven’t tested the motion sensor yet.
The ""Ringing” notification is only very slightly delayed (<1sec.). I also attached my existing door chime to the appropriate relay output of the DoorBird. Another relay output controls the door opener, which also works well with the app. I also made use of the optional connection to my garage door Liftmaster system (MyQ). There is still another connection free for an additional doorbell button, if needed.
The intercom also works well, with only a slight delay, and it’s easy to understand at both ends, despite the traffic on a main road. The frame rate of the camera is a little irregular, due to the limited bandwidth of a Wi-Fi network (as I said before, the manufacturer recommends a wired connection). However, this doesn’t limit its usability.

The app has a few minor weaknesses, but is well laid-out and runs reliably, and I like the Liftmaster connection. What I still haven't found is a way to delete stored messages. I couldn’t find anything about that in the instructions. Maybe it has a FIFO-type memory?

Whenever the picture loads I do have good quality, but the picture takes FOREVER to switch to live view so I’m typically just letting anyone in when it’s locked because I fear for missing a package! If I wait until the video loads the courier is already back in their truck. This totally defeats the purpose of a gate and video system to filter who can come in and out. And we have the strongest internet on the block, our speeds are impeccable and have been verified by our AV guy on the spot so I don’t want to hear about it being a WiFi connection. It is an APP issue. We don’t have this issue with our R**g video system, EVER.

But the biggest headache is that if you have your iPhone set to VIBRATE the notification is COMPLETELY SILENT! I assumed that it would work like other video systems that adjust to the setting on your phone (my mistake I would NOT have purchased this if I knew notifications would be 100% silent even if my phone is set to VIBRATE). 

Because of this we miss SO many packages and SO many people have been locked out in the evenings because I have to be looking at my phone every second of every minute or else I’ll miss the SILENT push notification. This is INSANE! I shouldn’t have to have my ringer volume on loud, annoying me and my children and my clients all day with loud pings from every single app and call I get just to use this ONE app. 

Extremely disappointing, and we spent a lot of money on what we thought was “the best system” I regret it and the past few months have been a SERIOUS HEADACHE for us because we cannot keep our phone volume on during the day so ya, we just miss 80% of anyone coming to the gate ever. We bought this to make our life easier and it has made it worse, because it’s just not functionally sound to have silent notifications.

In fact I paid  almost $150.00 more than for the American products but the quality is way better. The distance from my door to my router is  240ft and only the oorbird is capable of working in this difficult environment. Doorbird’s  audio quality is excellent, even when I only have 3G available.
Great product.";"2015-10-29T14:47:40-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=898756315&type=Purple%20Software";"898756315";94;"en";"POSITIVE"

there are no notifications when someone uses a pin code on the keypad 

there is also no easily accessible log (its only deep in the settings)

there needs to be an audible sound on the doorbird when a relay is triggered from the app.

also need a way to remove a relay if it’s. it in use.";"2018-10-23T23:35:34-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=898756315&type=Purple%20Software";"898756315";60;"en";"NEGATIVE"
