There are lots of things that are cool like schedules and being able to converge multiple lights into a single switch… Creating switches where no wires exist, and so on. 

BUT THERE ARE NO TIMERS! There are so many rooms that you need light for only a few minutes (pantry, laundry room, or a garage)… Lights that constantly get left on and that people often forget to turn off. You have schedules, but why no timers??? The system knows how many and which lights are on at all times, how simple would it be to program the server that if it sees the pantry light on to turn it off in a designated amount of time (5, 10, or 20 minutes). 

Lord knows the switches are expensive enough, you would think that you could set it up as a timed switch, but you can’t… Not yet. And it wouldn’t require a different switch, just a feature in the app itself.";"2021-12-05T19:39:00-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=886753021&type=Purple%20Software";"886753021";171;"en";"NEGATIVE"

The two accounts that are required are a bit of a hassle, Home brings them together - and this is what we use. After three years of service, the system has been running rock solid and dependable. The system deals perfectly with the many lightning related power outages we have in Texas. 

I am super excited about the new fan controllers and will replace my eight fans that are on the old on/off switch today. Thank you for the 75 device expansion, not enough, though. A really nice feature would be the merger of the RA Select and Caseta lines for more flexibility. I do not believe it would eat into revenue as both lines serve completely different markets. But it would allow tinkerer to spend more money that they otherwise would not spend. 

An in-wall outlet is missing from the line, the plug-in model is no replacement. I am running a couple of Z-wave outlets today for these for various things such as pump controller, outside lighting, and holiday illumination. Z-wave has been running fairly stable, but compared to Clear Connect, no comparison. Z-wave so and so often fails to trigger, whereas Clear Connect works every single time.";"2019-08-26T20:38:36-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=886753021&type=Purple%20Software";"886753021";208;"en";"POSITIVE"

But Siri only works well with the iPhone. The watch does download the app but does not let you control anything. I had to delete My Home in HomeKit and reload the bridges to get it working. That is crazy. Also, the app watch does not let you access devices. It only lets you access scenes. So unless you create a scene you will not see your device. So create a scene to turn on a light and create a 2nd scene to turn off the light. Not very smart. 

With all that said, I don’t think there is a better hardware device for switches. Add Hue Lights to Caseta and you have an amazing system. 

The 30ft Range is not a problem for me yet but at a minimum they should create a mesh of Bridges that could add 50 devices each. So that with 3 Bridges one could handle 150 devices. 2 Bridges with 2 separate accounts is not an acceptable solution. And the expensive custom “RA2” which is a premium to the “Caseta” system is not HomeKit ready which means that even for free no one would want that outdated expensive system.  Currently you can only do 50 switches on Caseta, which means you have to be selective on what to use Caseta. May be light switches using Caseta and use a different Brand to control power plugs.";"2018-04-12T18:48:45-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=886753021&type=Purple%20Software";"886753021";240;"en";"POSITIVE"

I never have any issues with the app and I can easily adjust lighting from my iPhone, iPads, even my Apple Watch in a pinch. And I have a few wireless remotes in the remote cradles and remotes mounted on walls with regular switch plates that work just light regular dimming light switches.  I also have the hub which is key and it integrates with Apple HomeKit so you can let Siri adjust things for you too. 

When friends and family come over they're seriously blown away - it's professional-grade. It's not exactly cheap, but I'm not looking for cheap - I want something that works flawlessly and that doesn't cost an arm and a leg either.  

Switching lighting scenes couldn't be simpler.  Combine that with auto shade adjustments and even temperature control and jaws drop.  For me it's the ultimate convenience that I love, and being able to achieve the perfect lighting levels for every occasion.

Perhaps it’s because it’s terrible and the makers of the app don’t have access to a calendar/weather? I mean the weather app on my phone has sunrise sunset. Newsflash Lutron: rise/set changes throughout the year.

 As city apartment dwellers we often come and go with our hands full (groceries, trash, deliveries, etc) so having the function has proven to be a huge help and we don’t want to have to shut it off.

Luton Caseta Hardware: 5 stars. 
Lutron Caseta App: 1 star. 

This app, is pretty bad. Bad design and it’s slow. 

But the beauty of Caseta, is that you can use the apple Home app to control all of these devices. That works amazingly well!

So you only need to use this app once when you install a new device. After that, close it and forget about it. Use the home app and enjoy the best smart switch platform on the market.

If you spent more money on proper app development rather than whatever you pay for data aggregation (and probably sell my privacy) we’d have a functional product that still costs more than HUE.

My brother is a ultra high end custom AV installer and I worked for him when I got out of college for about 7 years mainly running wires and installing hardware, but got a chance to see some pretty awesome stuff regarding automation.....including Lutron’s higher end equipment such as homework’s (if it’s still called that) which I thought was amazing, but it would be a while before I could afford anything like that. So ten years later and 3 kids! I buy a house and my bro sends me a smart bridge, 3 dimmers and 8 plug dimmers to kind of get me going with my new house until I decide to get serious he says and blow some coin! Well I’m not quite sure what else I would need in addition to what I got. Every time I go to Home Depot I would buy a switch and now I have 19 dimmers and 8 plug dimmers! All I really have left to change out is the fan switches. I can not express how much I love this system! For very little money for the bridge and a switch or two you have a good foundation that you can build on as you get a little extra funding. I have a Control4 system as well that I have all the lights tied to, but keep the schedules and scenes in the Lutron app because it is so easy and I can change things in the Lutron app a whole heck of a lot easier than I can Control4!

The app is ok, but I see two major flaws:

#1:  You can create a Scene to group multiple lights together, so that you can turn them all on—at the desire combination of brightness even—with one tap on your phone. However here’s the rub. You can tap the Scene to turn on the lights, but if tap you tap it again they don’t turn off. Lutron has you create a second Scene, which takes unnecessary time, and unnecessary real estate in your phone, just to turn off the lights. Makes no sense. So think about this. Every time you create a Scene, you will actually need to create TWO Scenes. 

#2: Lutron, please give us Dark Mode as an option for the app. Imagine trying to control lights in the middle of the night with a super bright phone screen. Not good.

[edit/update]

On #2, the app currently provides a “dark” theme which makes the panel a transparent black, however the default background is light blue and rather bright, so with this combination it defeats the purpose. The edges of the screen, particularly the top section, are very bright (at night) even when setting your phone to its lowest brightness. The workaround that I found is to set a custom background to a completely black photo. Thankfully Lutron allows this feature, and if you take a photo while your hand is covering the camera lens, you can get an all black photo and mimic a true dark mode!";"2020-06-17T22:38:10-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=886753021&type=Purple%20Software";"886753021";274;"en";"POSITIVE"

Our electrician actually did it, as we didn’t know about this product & hired him as we didn’t want to pull wire on an exterior wall.  We didn’t buy the bridge then because we didn’t see the value in it.  

Now we have twins & I constantly would sit down and have a baby start to fall asleep on my lap, but have the lights on.  If I got up to turn them off the baby would wake up, but the baby also wouldn’t fall completely asleep with the light on.  I decided we ‘needed’ a switch for that light, & decided to get the light switch with the bridge combo pack.  

It has been a game changer.  Now when we leave the house, instead of repeatedly yelling at my four year old to turn off all the lights, I just ask Siri to turn off all the lights.  Done. Awesome.  

I also now have lights set on a schedule to come on at 5 pm & turn off at 11 pm, so we aren’t in the dark outside anymore.  The commands are separate, so we have one light that comes on but they all turn off.  If the kids turn the lights on for some reason, they still all turn off at 11 pm.  The remote by the outside garage door that the electrician put in, we reprogrammed to operate all the outside lights, so one switch lights it all up.  Very handy for quick lighting when we can’t find the dog or worry there is a coyote outside.

Unfortunately the weak point is the app.

-by time the application loads I can use my echo to launch three different scenes. This can't be that hard to solve.
-like many others, I pine for a landscape view. I have a Harmony system as well and for something like an iPad, it's a natural layout. Switching between the two applications, this app feels like an afterthought.
-by far the most painful problem with the application is that I have 2 Smart hubs. I have one for each home but I could easily see somebody having 2 on their property.  It seems like you can only control one hub per account. That would not be a terrible thing if it weren't for this application. Switching hubs requires me to log out and manually type in the name and password for the other hub. I noticed my Harmony has no trouble switching between my two harmony hubs. Apple has a technology called keychain that would easily allow storing and retrieving the information for each account so that I could easily switch when I'm at a different house.

Installation was a really smooth experience: the system really simplifies wiring (effectively, turning three-pole switches back into single pole switches, controlled by wireless remotes), allows for lots of customisation (like being able to control multiple lights in a room with one button press), and is a great improvement on all the manual switches we had before.

 

Overall, I’m impressed – but there are a couple of seemingly obvious things that have been overlooked.

Firstly, my partner and I both have iPhones – but Lutron’s geofencing isn’t smart enough to tell when one of us is home and the other is out, and only switch lights on if we’re both out, for example. If I turn the option on and leave, all the lights go off, leaving my husband in darkness. Not all that smart, right? There’s a workaround if you have a Nest device that can be set to determine whether someone’s home, but if you don’t have one, this isn’t an option. If our thermostat can get this right, why can’t Lutron?

 

And then there’s the Siri/HomeKit integration. I love being able to tell Siri to “turn the kitchen lights on” or “set the living room lights to 50%” – but why doesn’t HomeKit see the Scenes I’ve set up in the Lutron app, too? If I tell Siri to “set the lights to Evening”, she tells me she doesn’t know what I’m talking about. Again, there’s a workaround: you can duplicate these Scenes as new Scenes in HomeKit – but it seems like an oversight. And, at time of writing, the Lutron app isn’t supported for the Shortcuts app, either.

 

Finally, we need a better way to make “tweaks” to Scenes that have already been set up. Live editing isn’t possible, and neither is it possible to “grab” the way the lights are set in a room and store that as a Scene. This means, if I decide I want to make changes, that I have to go into each device, one by one, make a note of the dimming level, then manually enter it in the Scene afterwards. This should be a simple fix in a future update, but will it happen?

 

A little more thought would make this a killer app and system. Right now, I’d say we’re at 3 out of 5.";"2019-02-22T10:30:54-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=886753021&type=Purple%20Software";"886753021";400;"en";"POSITIVE"

My wife had been using the Pico Remote to control two lights in the den for several weeks as I decided whether to expand my Caseta universe to replace the plethora of Maestro switches (one set for the outdoor patio area is a five-way set-up) I have happily used for 17 or so years in my home.

This morning, spouse gets up and can't get her lamp and the painting light to come on regardless of which button she pushed on the Pico remote which ""controls"" an in-wall dimmer and plug-in dimmer. The only thing I had changed about the set-up was ""integrating"" Apple's HomeKit with the Caseta app. Indeed - I checked on the light switches, and it was as if they had never been paired with the hub. Perhaps ""using HomeKit names"" had screwed things up within the Caseta app?

What I do know is that when setting up devices for the first time in the Lutron/Caseta app, there is a ""Default Room"" that devices are put into. After you set up the devices it is extremely difficult to move them from the ""Default Room"" to any other room in the home. AND, if like me, you make the mistake of setting up an incorrect room - there is (according to the Lutron Forums) still no way to delete a room. Imagine the fun of trying to delete DEN or Den. I spent enough time looking for the solution to ""how do I delete a room"" from the Lutron/Caseta app that I finally joined the Lutron Forum - BUT I can't post anything yet, because even though the forum said I had been sent an activation/verification email - I am still awaiting the arrival of said email. 

I have now deleted both HomeKit and the Lutron/Caseta app. I will start over with the install one more time. Two hours after joining the Lutron Community Forum and STILL NO VERIFICATION EMAIL from Lutron. Of course, when multiple home capability has been added to the app, and no one from Lutron has bothered to reply to the continuing questions about needing an different email address for each home - I question how valuable the forum will be anyway.";"2021-05-03T11:40:54-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=886753021&type=Purple%20Software";"886753021";391;"en";"NEGATIVE"

Just a week or so ago I decided to make my whole house ‘smarter’ when it came to lighting and a thermostat. I had all the nice regular Lutron dimmers that only have 2 BUTTONS and the hidden kill switch, like the CASETA line does as well.  

The ORIGINAL DESIGN was SUPER SLEEK/SIMPLE & EFFECTIVE: the MAIN of 2 buttons was a SINGLE LARGE TAP STYLE BUTTON, which you tapped once to turn ON/OFF the lights; TAPPED TWICE to turn on LIGHTS ON IN FULL BRIGHTNESS, or PRESSED & HELD for 10 seconds so it’d give you 30 seconds to exit the room fully lit and then it’d slowly dimmed to warn you it was turning off. 

SECOND BUTTON was a THIN ROCKER STYLE (push upper side to raise brightness or bottom side to lower it); and it still had 10 tiny green LED’s next to rocker button to indicate brightness level. 

Many of these ‘non-smart’ dimmers could even be CONFIGURED MANUALLY by clicking each of these buttons in certain sequences to set the max/low voltage you wanted lights to receive to accommodate the different types of bulbs, and other features like the ones with incorporated MOTION SENSORS (those are DEVINE - configuration options are so plenty, you’ll need the manual for sure). 

The other BEAUTIFUL THING about the ‘dumb’ dimmers was that once you set a BRIGHTNESS LEVEL using the ROCKER BUTTON, you’d only need to tap the MAIN BUTTON and lights would always turn on at that LAST/DESIRED BRIGHTNESS. 

The new ‘SMART’ CASETA DIMMERS LOOK ALMOST IDENTICAL, but for some reason LUTRON felt it needed to add TWICE AS MANY BUTTONS and COMPLICATE what was a SUPER SIMPLE DESIGN & OPERATION. 

Irony is that now I get LESS FEATURES with these new dinners with more buttons, plus now new buttons also make it hard to press them since they are CRAMMED in the SAME AMOUNT of REAL-ESTATE - there are 4 BUTTONS where there was ONLY ONE BEFORE. 

Now, if I turn the lights, I have to click the dedicated ON BUTTON, but they DONT RESUME at the LAST BRIGHTNESS LEVEL, but at FULL BRIGHTNESS, and then you need to CLICK 10 TIMES the LOWER BRIGHTNESS BUTTON to reduce light output; or ALTERNATIVELY, turn lights on SLOWLY by CLICKING THE BRIGHTNESS ’UP’ BUTTON 10 TIMES - what????? I can’t even recall what was was my desired brightness for this lamp, let alone all in the house. 

How’s this progress? I’m hoping there’s a setting I’ve missed somewhere in the app, or the switches’ manual, that set lights to turn on at last dimmer value. 

To get around this major issue (for me - have lots of mood lighting), you either need to CREATE A ‘SCENE’ ON THE PHONE APP - and run to pull out your phone, unlock it, and find the app, then find the scene, EVERY TIME you want to turn on a light (when the physical dimmer is one touch away right next to you)? 

OR, the other option I found is to BUY ONE PICO REMOTE PER LIGHT SWITCH, which contains an ADDITIONAL FITH TINY BUTTON in the center, and the ONLY VALUABLE BUTTON, which can be programmed to turning the lights on at a PRESET DESIRED BRIGHTNESS.

What a FAIL. I hope like I said: that I either missed something, or that this will be fixable via through some sort of FIRMWARE UPDATE at some point. 

And I do have the problem on rare occasions where not all lights turn on when I choose a SCENE. 

I have about 10 LIGHT CASETA DIMMERS and another 10 CASETA LAMP DIMMERS (and more to come). House is small one floor 1500SF and no solid walls. However, this issue is rare and mostly happens if I press one scene too soon after another. 

Oh!, and some LED lights DONT FULLY TURN OFF when I turn off the LAMP DIMMER - I’m guessing they need very light current to turn them on. 

SIMILARLY, several of the lights ONLY DIM SO MUCH. Even when dimmer is set at 1% in app, light lights at 25-30%. In the old ‘dumb’ dimmers, the LOW/TOP VOLTAGE LEVELS could be adjusted until light turned fully off - not here that I can tell. 

So how can more buttons and ‘smart’ Wifi capabilities actually end up REDUCING functionality? Beats me.";"2021-07-09T00:49:20-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=886753021&type=Purple%20Software";"886753021";756;"en";"POSITIVE"

The switches and the plug switch dimmers are great and easy to add and operate. I'd recommend adding a plug switch that can be used outside for lights decorations. Or at least allow to use of other already available switches like the GE outside plug switch. offer a toggle in-wall switch. And one last, integrate a camera to your product line or the ability to add ip camera access to the app.

I have a ton of light switches that I have been replacing with the Lutron Caseta Switches (both stand alone and the one that include the pico remotes).  My only two recommendations are this.

1.  I wish the application would have the ability to let you reorganize how the light switches appear in order in the application along with reorganizing scenes as well.  I started one room and added switches over the course of the month.  Then I realized that I have to scroll to the end of the list to use lights I thought I wouldn't touch that much.

The setup is a bit iffy given that they require a login (they want your email) which is completely unnecessary. They then require you keep an account or they un-pair and disconnect any Caseta device that you've added to the hub. This is odd given that HomeKit only requires pairing via the HomeKit digits/code. 

Anyway, once paired you don't ever have to use their app which tries to restrict you to their brand partners.

The HomeKit framework lets any true HomeKit app (Elgato Eve is an excellent example) to control their devices via scenes, timers, and rules and of course their is Siri too. I think their design flaw is that they've created a device that lets them play with as many protocols and frameworks as possible and this is why they default to requiring a login account for setup.

3. Scenes sort in the order they are created and cannot be resorted - this is lazy programming, allow manual and/or alphabetical sort, please!

- Wish you could get rid of the useless picture that takes up 1/3 of the screen. Why is it there????!?
- wish you could control the order of the buttons. 
- Wish there was an iPad version.";"2015-01-16T00:14:08-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=886753021&type=Purple%20Software";"886753021";66;"en";"POSITIVE"

O'Whora";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id35669523";"4.1.0";3;"Not great but HomeKit integration works well";"This app does what it is supposed to but it comes with poor documentation and ugly interface. However it is integrated with Apple's built in HomeKit. What that means is that once you add your Lutron devices with the Lutron app you can use Apple's ""Home"" app to control your Lutron Caseta devices, create scenes, and invite other members of your household so they can also use the Home app to control your home's lights, etc. You never have to use the Lutron app once your home is setup.
Tips-
*When setting up the Lutron app it will ask you to setup an account and password. You will also get a warning that only one account can be used. Don't worry, this is merely an administrator account -it can be any valid email address and password specific for your Lutron controller. Only you need to know the details. You will still be able to invite other users with iCloud accounts to control your Lutron switches, etc.
*Use the Lutron app to add devices etc.
*Launch Apple's Home app (you might need iOS 10) and you should see your Lutron devices. You can also create scenes to control groups of lights and/or outlets. To dim lights tap and hold the switch until a slider pops up.
*Invite other members of your home to control your devices by tapping the triangle/compass icon in the top left of Home's home screen. 
*When an invited user launches the Home app on their iOS device they will see the invite. Once accepted they will be also be able to control your homes Lutron devices. There is no need for them to use -or even download- the Lutron app.";"2017-01-15T04:31:40-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=886753021&type=Purple%20Software";"886753021";283;"en";"POSITIVE"

App Developer Requests Pretty Please:

-Allow in-app editing for how Lonng it takes for lights to turn off. Not everyone wants a drawn out fading effect. Please allow the Fade Out to be shortened or eliminated.

-Allow in-app editing of Dimming range for both High or Low max/min light trim levels

-Bug Fix request. I fully reset my bridge to remove the previous owner (bought bridge used on Amazon). Then added it to Homekit and Still get told Name Already Exists when trying to assign a room to my dimmer. If you are going to pull in my Home’s room and display their names, please let me actually select those rooms in the Lutron app.

— Allow in app editing of the status LED light… Like turning it off entirely or dimming it so that it isn’t a nuisance when trying to sleep etc

Edit (to Developer, thank you for responding)
1. I’m interested in adjusting the fade off time when at a minimum I press the off button directly on either the dimmer or paired Pico controls. My understanding was whether I use Pico or the Lutron app or the Home app all roads lead to the main dimmer in my 4-way switch setup. So if the dimmer can have its fade off time shortened hopefully everything then anything else in my home that controls said dimmer will also yield a shortened fade off time. 

2. Thank you, I will give that a try and it seems a like a suitable workaround for now. I hope this changes and becomes an in-app configurable setting please.

3. I will email you and hope you guys can really address this. It feels like years ago all over again in a bad way when I saw this same kind of issue with Philips Hue lights. They also seem to struggle with reconciling existing Siri names against existing  Apple Home app names against names being requested in the Lutron app. My hope is for simply a hard reset of the bridge to erase all names from a previous owner. Then pair to HomeKit and all names of rooms should be prioritized by whatever the Home app shows. If those names show up in Lutron, great, but they should just be a conduit for the Home app room names, not trying to fight the Home app and potentially duplicate room names with Lutron vs Apple Home. 

4. Thank you but I mean on the dimmer not the bridge. It seems fairly dim when the lights are off and then fairly bright when the lights on. I think that’s ok for now but Leviton offered within their app a setting to turn off the status bar leds so they don’t ever come on at all or a very dim setting so they were super subtle.";"2020-10-15T07:24:28-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=886753021&type=Purple%20Software";"886753021";496;"en";"POSITIVE"

I think you can “technically” use a light pico remote for shades as well.

This was my FIRST ever smart-home device. 

Ordered Caséta Wireless dimmer kit with smart bridge on Amazon.

Setup was a BREEZE:

1) DIY installed 2 Lutron Caseta dimmers into pre-existing switch slots where previous manual dimmers were.

2) Plugged in & connected the Lutron hub/bridge. 

3) Downloaded Lutron App, followed setup instructions. 

Just plain works.

I will be buying more Lutron devices.

EDIT 8/21/17 - dropped rating to 4-stars. There still isn't interoperability between RA2 and Caseta. There aren't any motion sensors for the Caseta system. 50-device limit per bridge is restricting. Haven't tested if this app will work with 2 bridges. But I will need to get another one so will update then. Lutron is the BEST, & Caseta is the highest quality switch system to date, but lacks a motion sensor, & needs to allow >50 devices.

Update 8/23/17: figured out scenes, thanks. Raised to 5-stars because the Lutron app actually IMPROVES the Apple Home app by adding ""Zones"". This is helpful for upstairs, downstairs, basement, attic, garage, porch, & patio ""zones"" with multiple rooms that you want to control without ""grouping"" them as Apple makes you do. Also raised the rating to 5-stars bc I've been using the app & Caseta system and it works flawlessly! Lutron has a golden goose here with Caeta line. Build it out & up!

After not being able to set the system up correctly over the weekend, and communication with Lutron Caséta support, today the smart bridge updated its firmware and integration with SIRI worked.

The three stars are really for the customer support.

On the bad side, I still am concerned about:
1. Why the smart bridge needs so many ports
2. Why there is no admin system in the smart bridge
3. Why the firmware update system broke and nobody seemed to know about it
4. Why the 24x7 support isn't as advertised

==================

In order to even use the smart bridge you need the app.

Here’s the kicker, when you first plug in the smart bridge and use the app it tries to do a firmware upgrade which is needed in order to use HomeKit (yes they shipped it with old firmware despite the HomeKit label printed, not a sticker mind you, on the box)

I call customer support which is 24/7 and get a guy called Zach who tells me that it needs to be able to access outbound ports and that some ISP’s block these. Here’s the email:
""Often cable modem/router combination products that are sold by ATT U-verse, Verizon, Comcast, COX, and some other internet providers are locked down more than a standard cable modem would be. I would contact your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and ensure the following ports are open: 7443, 4443, 443, 8883, 1883, 123, and 22.”

I assume these are outbound ports as nobody in their right mind would allow these all open inbound to their network. Anyway, as I have a business connection I know none of these ports are blocked, but to humor them I created static routes for inbound, which didn’t work, then let the “Smart Bridge” be in the DMZ (which there is no way I’m going to do permanently)… Nothing worked.

I then called back 24/7 support to find that it’s not 24/7 at all for the Caseta products (despite the Caseta site stating it is).

Finally a guy on the forum came up with a way to get the app working. however. Great I can control my device now with the iPhone.

Then I try to integrate with Siri through the app. Guess what, it requires the firmware be updated. And that reset all my devices (yes, it’s that dumb) and I’m back to square one with nothing working.

This is the worst network product I’ve ever bought. Utter rubbish";"2015-08-10T16:35:34-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=886753021&type=Purple%20Software";"886753021";414;"en";"POSITIVE"

They are the best on the market and I would recommend anyone looking to get smart home light switches or blinds that work with HomeKit and the Amazon Echo.  

But the iPhone app really needs a lot of work. Interface is outdated and you can't customize the layout very much. They need to add more light & device icons to customize your setup.";"2017-04-10T13:52:03-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=886753021&type=Purple%20Software";"886753021";74;"en";"POSITIVE"
