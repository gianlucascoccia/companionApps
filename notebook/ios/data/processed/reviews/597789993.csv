This doesn't work. Yes it will turn off when it stops receiving Bluetooth signal, but it doesn't turn back on until you run the app. 

So you have to get your phone out and run the app, even if you already had it running you have to refresh it. 

iPhone also shuts down Bluetooth when the screen is locked, so your lights will turn off automatically unless you disable the auto-lock which is ridiculous. If you aren't going to lock your screen, you're not going to put your phone in your pocket or bag. And you don't want to have to go into the settings and change the auto lock every time you leave and return. 

In short, poor design. At $30-40 per bulb it's a waste of money. It's so much easier to use a light switch which completely defeats the purpose of automation technology.";"2014-08-10T13:25:56-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=597789993&type=Purple%20Software";"597789993";156;"en";"NEGATIVE"

1.) Works great
2.) It's an LED lightbulb and works just like an ordinary lightbulb if you don't want to get fancy.
3.) Easy to discover the lightbulb and configure and control through the app on my phone.
4.) Dimmer control on the phone, which I often use due to where the lightbulb is situated in my house.
5.) Timer control where you can set when the light should be on and off. I've had a manual plug-in timer for this previously that is now retired.

Original review - October 2015:
Numerous users have already reported this but there appears to be no response from You, the developer. Your app has always been behind in development terms, but this is the worst because the app crashes immediately when starting which makes it completely unusable and makes it impossible to access our bulbs or their settings...Please update ASAP, and while you are at it, please update the functionality - i.e. Integration with Ring doorbells, lockitron bolt, nest thermostats, Apple home kit, etc, etc...it would be great if your app kept up with the latest trends in home automation etc.";"2016-01-04T02:29:24-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=597789993&type=Purple%20Software";"597789993";186;"en";"POSITIVE"

When you attempt to enter any text fields (Group Name, Room Name, etc...) the app will not respond to the keyboard. Thus, you cannot add any names to anything. Also, when you click on Advanced, the app crashes and returns you to the home screen. Timer works, which is nice.";"2013-10-21T10:19:14-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=597789993&type=Purple%20Software";"597789993";62;"en";"POSITIVE"
