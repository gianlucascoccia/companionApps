This versions release notes say iOS 13 bug fixes.  Every time I launch the app it immediately crashes.  The same happens on iPadOS.  I have tried uninstalling the app many times and even that is problematic.  The app icon disappears after the uninstall but reappears after I restart my phone.  When the app does reappear on the phone it displays the white grid, icon placeholder and not the actual iHome icon.  When I go to the App Store at that point it believes the app is still installed so it gives me the option to open the app instead of install the app.

I place a lot of the blame here on Apple and iOS 13.  That’s why I’m giving a non functional app 3 stars instead of 1.

This product line and app are great!  Love the products and love the app!  Setup is a breeze too!  Homekit integration works perfect and I can use Siri to turn on and off outlets.  I have 10 iSP8’s in my house and 3 iSS50 environment monitors which are great for temperature and humidity rules. The rules work perfect and I truly never have any issues at all.  Gets too hot or humid in the crawl space, no problem, the environment monitor triggers a rule and switches on an outlet that has a fan plugged into it - and notifies me via the app.  Beautiful!

I have set up 4 other brands with little effort. 

I tried to set up the device following the prompts from the app. It never asked for the passcode and setup stalled. 

I followed the alternate instructions of manually adding the device (which it did with no problem) and then adding from within the app and still no luck. I have done a hard reset after every attempt. 

Finally I manually added device to network and used HomeKit to connect to device which it did with no problem. I went back to the app and got an error message but restarted app and device was there and could be controlled from both HomeKit and the app. 
 Unfortunately, less than 5 hours after install, I needed to unplug the device and plug back in because HomeKit could no longer connect to the device. There was no problem with any other smart home device.

I then tried to add to Alexa. There is absolutely nothing in the instructions or app about how to do this. Alexa could not find the devices. 

Not sure if I will bother with not adding to Alexa (which I am trying to move away from for privacy concerns). 

Overall I am not happy with device. It really should not be this hard to add a device.  Ihomewas good enough to respond to my review, but only addressed adding to Alexa and telling me to call support.

While this is an app review and not a product review they are interrelated, i.e. the performance of one influences the other. 

In this case the app and the products worked as expected. Followed the directions and I was flicking lights on and off from my iPhone like a champ in ten minutes. 

A few caveats. Apple’s Home Kit integration works fine as long as you are connected to your home network. For remote access USING HOME KIT you need a hub. But there is remote access using the iHome Control app and their cloud connection. But as earlier pointed out iHome Control only works with iHome products. 

Second-setting up rules is easy, but event triggers for the monitor to push notifications require a separate rule for each event. My first attempt was to create one rule to trigger a notification if temp went below 50°, or light or motion was detected. On test no notification. After a close reading I saw that all three conditions had to be met. Once I figured that out and set up one rule for temp, one for light and one for motion everything worked just fine.";"2018-12-28T09:13:28-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=937056509&type=Purple%20Software";"937056509";212;"en";"POSITIVE"

Repeated steps from before after cloud was ‘fixed’ and had same issues with one but not the other.  Then the other became non-responsive as well.

It’s mind-boggling that this app could be released when it is fundamentally broken.  It will give you the same prompt or error endlessly until you force-close the app.  

What garbage!  I remember seeing first-time programmers make this kind of mistake in Fundamentals of Computer Science I.  Maybe they are getting high-school hobby programmers to do the work as interns or something.

I tried resetting the phone, deleting and reinstalling the iHome app from the App Store, resetting the sensor, etc.  I called iHome customer support who was unable to help.  They finally suggested that I simply wait a few hours and try again.  Why?  It didn’t work.  The app is broken.

But I can’t get by square one in setting up the app. The Quick Start instructions are very much best-case instructions.

They don’t tell you that you have to enable “Home” in iCloud, or else you’ll just see “Cloud Data Sync in Progress (77)” forever, with no indication of what that means. Even after I managed to troubleshoot these two major hurdles, I still get a blank screen when I try to connect the Smartplug device. 

Perhaps if there were better documentation, this could be workable. But by trying to make the process look simple and easy, the half-page of quick-start instructions (and nothing further) basically makes the item useless. 

And clicking on “Get Help” at the bottom of some of the screens basically leads to a more verbose version of the the quick start. No real troubleshooting, no real help.

Turns out, the Koogeek app works flawlessly in setting up the automation I wanted.  It found the iHome sensor and let me use it to set up an automation routine.  So they proved it’s possible to see a and use a HomeKit device made by another company.

In comparison, my Lutron didn’t bat an eyelid - it simply continued to work after the password change like nothing had happened.

Another pain point is that you don’t allow the use of special characters when naming devices or rules - not even underscore characters! That’s really inconsiderate of your users.

If you’re not creative enough to come up good user scenarios and design for them, then at least copy the good ones out there.

HomeKit would not recognize either of the two plugs I bought. Decided to delete devices and start from scratch. Two days later with countless tries I finally was able to get the iHome app to recognize one of my plugs, but HomeKit will only work for 2 or 3 minutes before it becomes unrecognizable. An extra 3 days and still cannot get app to setup my 2nd plug. The main reason for this purchase was to use HomeKit and Siri. Sent email to iHome but no response. Will try calling today and hopefully be able to give a more positive review. Didn’t keep receipt from Walmart, may not be able to return. 

Now March 13—when I wrote the negative part of this review, I hadn’t yet called customer services. Before calling I had noticed an update for app. With great hope I updated with no change in my problems. Called for service, but was told technicians were out due to bad weather. Two days later got an email telling me about using the version of the app. I had already loaded. Tried many times to try getting the plug to work, including restoring and resetting my iPhone to a backup before I had purchased the plugs. One night I decided next day I would attempt a return at Walmart but that night before boxing them up—one last try. They hooked up and have worked with no problems. I love them now and would love more plugs. Just not sure I shouldn’t try the idevice this time. At the time of this update I give it 5 stars, because I don’t know for sure it wasn’t my WiFi signal.";"2018-03-13T18:59:27-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=937056509&type=Purple%20Software";"937056509";292;"en";"POSITIVE"

After treating two IT professionals to a very expensive dinner, they agreed to spend the evening at my house to get to the bottom of this situation. 

We erased all my Home iCloud data, signed out of my Apple ID out of each device I own, factory reset my HomePod and Apple TV’s (as these devices are your “Home Hub’s”). We then signed back into each device one-by-one before re-downloading the iHome iOS App, Factory Data Resetting each iHome Plug, and setting them up as new after verifying each device had the most up to date firmware. 

We tested each Apple product with each outlet as we went, and then assigned each smart home accessory with a Static-IP address. 

And here we are, the next evening, and everything is still working perfectly! Let’s hope it stays this way, but if something changes, I’ll update this review again. 

As of now, these products and their corresponding services are working perfectly!

——————————

First of all, I very rarely write reviews, and I don’t think I have ever left a 1-Star review before today. I will update this review when, or if, these issues are finally resolved. 

I am using an iPhone X 256GB (with over 100GB available) on iOS 11.4 (currently the newest iOS.)

I bought four iHome plugs April ‘17 when I bought my first Alexa. Everything worked flawlessly with all four plugs with Alexa, Siri, the Apple Home app, and with the proprietary iHome iOS application. 

However, about a little over a month ago issues began. At first just Siri stopped working at times. Then the Apple Home application would report outlets as randomly “Not Responding”, then Alexa stopped working, and of the last week, I can’t even get the propriety iHome iOS application to turn the lights on or off at times. 

When the issues first began to occur, I attempt to resolve the issue myself. Being an Apple Education Representative for a cellular carrier, I am familiar with the product and the steps needed to troubleshoot  these issues traditionally. 

SO, I Factory Data Reset each plug, re-setup each plug up, re-installed the iOS application from scratch, re-installed the Alexa skill from scratch, and deleted all of my Apple Home data from my iCloud. Everything was back to brand-new..... or so I thought. 

All of my hard work (about an hour and a half) allowed all of my products to work flawlessly (again) for about three hours. Then all the issues began again, until becoming unusable even within the propriety application. Two nights ago I couldn’t even turn off the lights in my bedroom or foyer to go to bed. 

So yesterday, I went and bought new Hue bulbs, and decided to go ahead and repeat all of troubleshooting to the iHome plugs AGAIN, in hopes that I would be able to use the two separate forms of smart light control all within the Apple Home app. I spent about three hours setting it all up.

Everything worked FLAWLESSLY.... for about an hour. Then the issues began again, but just with the iHome outlets. Each Hue product worked perfect, even the following day. I was so frustrated I immediately gathered all the iHome plugs and threw them into a box in my garage. 

Having spent all this money on the products, and all my time setting up the products and troubleshooting the products, it is very frustrating not to be able to USE the products. 

All I want is for the products to work. 

The fact that I am able to see online reviews of many people reporting the same issues tells me that this is not defective equipment or user error. It tells me that iHome has got something messed up awful, and is not willing to admit it and quickly fix it.

367;1985612064;"CebuReview";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id121537614";"2.2";5;"TG for Homekit";"Update Dec. 10, 2017
Well I’m making a drastic change in both my rating of this app and the devices but not because of improvements in the app but instead because of Homekit integration and other apps that can now work with the devices.  Yes, their app is horrid on my iPhone 6, (better on my iPad) but since deleting ALL rules in the app and instead using Homekit life with the devices is much better.  Now for Homekit details...

Integration of iHome with Homekit has let me again take control of my smart home.  Creating scenes such as morning and then automating them to run at certain times truly creates an easier carefree day, and here is just one example. 

I wake at 5:35am weekdays, I have a lighting scene automated to turn at 5:34am. I’m usually out the door by 7:50am but have setup the following rules and automation about leaving in case I leave early, etc.: Take note that due to DST and winter, sunrise and sunset really affect things by hours so rules can become complicated. When using ihome app I was always having to adjust times because the light of the day changes seasonal by several hours...

Note that “RUN” means to run the automation

Run Scene “AM Weekday ON” @ 5:34am, then...

1) Run “AM weekday OFF” scene at 7:50am 
    (accounts me leaving home at normal time)
2) Run “AM weekday OFF” scene at sunrise
    (accounts for winter darkness & summer light) 
3) Run “AM weekday OFF” when I leave 
     (Homekit geofence setup)

So the latest I ever leave is 7:50am, the other two conditions take care of conserving power if it gets light earlier or I’m ahead of schedule for leaving. 

As all of my home lighting is from solar power/batteries, conservation is always at the top.  I run other similar scenes and automations during the evenings, etc. 

I have many of iHome smart plugs using them for my lighting, Christmas tree, wax burners, plant light bulb, etc. and iHome had actually been nice enough to send me a complementary 5-in-1 SmartMonitor at no charge.  It’s sad to say that they should have done a bit more product development on it before going to market.  To even try to use the light sensor for day/night functions I had to point the light sensor outside (then anyone walking by my window could see the display data, not me lol) but found it was quite unreliable with activations, sensitivity and notifications,  I keep it in my garage now to monitor the temperature and when I’m working in there and let it control a smart plug for a salamander heater. 

So to recap, the iHome devices are now a suggested BUY THEM, but forget about controlling them with the iHome app.  Other managment functions on devices themselves such as device renaming etc. can be done quickly with the free app “Elgato Eve”

UPDATE: July 21, 2017
Ok these jerks just significantly limited their product.  They used to allow 10 rules for a device but they just changed it to 6.  If you have to change your wifi network when you do a reset the system will now only permit 6 rules.   You can't even set 1 per day now!

From their tech support when I asked about it:

""Yes, you are correct! Our developer said there were too many issue allowing 10 rules per plugs so they lower the amount of rules.  

Thanks, 
iHome Support ""

After using their product over a year and them selling thousands of these devices across the country they just discover this? Yeah, right.   Smoke screen.  
- - - - -
Device icons show up properly only in edit device.  When device listing appears (all devices on one page) it no longer displays.  I'm on iOS 10 iPhone 6. 

Example:  Audio icon changes to outlet plug when viewing devices, but the lamp icon displays properly.  

All in all the app has a nice interface and easy to understand but it would be great to be able to see all rules in a rule summary page instead of having to drill down to each device.";"2017-12-10T06:29:40-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=937056509&type=Purple%20Software";"937056509";693;"en";"POSITIVE"

Many of the the devices, although they look similar, are different so it’s not as if you can just check one to see if an update is available for all.

Second, this app used to show you when devices were unreachable. Now, it optimistically assumes they’re all ok until you toggle one on/off and then it finally admits that it didn’t even check. It seems iHome is hiding s much larger problem with their devices. They work great until they don’t. Every so often about half of mine will not be accessible. Some of these devices are within 10ft of the WiFi station. It seems as if they occasionally lock up and never reset and try to reconnect. Resetting the WiFi does nothing. The same devices that were connected before show up. You need to go around and manually unplug each of the ones that won’t connect. Then, they’re back and they work great! That is, until another few randomly won’t connect. It’s never the same ones. All mine have reserved IP addresses on my network. 

If iHome thinks someone else is to blame, then post the technical details. All my other home automation devices do not have this kind of problem. 

The app cannot easily change any network settings after initial set up. If you would like to, for instance change the name of the WiFi base station they connect to, you need to go through the entire set up process including scanning the HomeKit label. Furthermore, the app won’t even show the MAC address of any device. You need to unplug it and look at the tiny label.

The lack of thought and functionality put into this app shows how little concern they have. It’s been around long enough to expect some functionality in it. It seems it is just meant to give you a good initial experience and then nothing more. I’ll keep my devices as long as I can but I’m not buying any more of them.";"2019-04-20T10:46:41-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=937056509&type=Purple%20Software";"937056509";366;"en";"POSITIVE"

It has increased in its capability, and has not decreased my frustration. I tried updating the firmware, but it seemed the firmware update function failed. I decided to try setting up an account to see if this would enable the update, because updates are not able to be triggered from within the Homekit app, and thus is not redundant unlike all the other features of this app. Lo and behold, the password field does not allow pasting, and thus I am required to manually type in the long complex password I generated from 1Password. So already this is not going well; this decision to not allow pasting just decreased the security of the account. So as soon as I memorize and type in the long password and setup the account, I go back to the firmware update to find that it updated, maybe in the background. So I just decreased the security of my system by linking it to an iHome account for nothing. Perhaps some indication of a queued update in progress would have helped prevent this review update and the meretricious newly created account.

Original review: Requires an account to do anything interesting. It is possible to provide useful and powerful capabilities without requiring one more account in a world of way too many accounts. It’s better just to control iHome devices through the default Apple HomeKit app.

I'm currently running six smart plugs on this app and they all work every time. It has a really clean and straight forward interface.

My only suggested app improve would be to include a warning on the setup viewController that hard codes a warning that you should switch your phone wifi connection ""off"" of your 5ghz connection, and onto your lower strength connection only during the setup process. Unfortunately I had to call in to find this out when my pairings failed and I found out the smart plugs can't pair across a 5ghz connection.

And once you do that, you to have to go through the setup process for your whole home and each switch.  I've had the switches for 2 weeks, had to completely reset my homekit setup and redo it twice already to keep this app working.  And if I had any other homekit devices, resetting everything every time would just be insanely frustrating.

I purchased several of these (along with other HomeKit devices) for testing and review. These iHome switches are by far the worst implementation of Apples HomeKit concept. Testing them across several iOS devices, different versions of iOS, and different network environments all noted the same failures, chief among these was the inability for Siri to control the switch after about 48 hours. Oddly, the app can still operate the switches, but cannot check for firmware updates on the devices.

I would return the units, but that might imply that someone else would buy them, and my conscience will not allow me to inflict pain and suffering of this magnitude on another human being.

Did the makers of this system ever think, for a moment, that you would maybe want to use it with more than one iOS device? No, it appears they didn't. The app assumes you are setting up a brand new iHome switch even when it's already up and running on your other device. It makes you reset it and go through the excruciating setup process again. Then once you get it working on the new iOS device, it stops working on the original one. Brilliant. 

Original review: I was disappointed to find out that my iHome plug doesn't support a Notification Center widget. It also doesn't work with IFTTT or have any way to turn on the switch based on your location, unless you have a Nest thermostat. Also, half the time Siri says she can't find any devices, and then I try again right away and it works fine.

However if you need to make changes to the schedule, then you have problems. First, the app makes you log in each time.  Normally not a problem, but more so an inconvenience. Except their app won't let you log in. I tied for over a week to get past the initial screen with login button. Magically one day it worked. Support was totally useless.

The setup of the plug via the app takes way too long. The app even recommends resetting the plug if you run into this problem (which you will). The app/directions offer vague instructions for set up when you encounter problems. You also need to set up an account which is always annoying for something as simple as a ""smart"" device.
