It’s okay for temporarily changing the temperature, but anything else will either be time-consuming and tedious, or just outright won’t work. For an example, I painstakingly set a schedule (wake/away/sleep) for every day in the app. However, the furnace starts heating the house about an hour before the times shown in the app. So I thought I’d delete the settings and start over. Can’t do that. I tried using the copy function to overwrite all the days. The copy function didn’t work. I changed each day individually. The furnace still starts an hour earlier. This got very annoying since the temperature change tends to wake me up in the morning.

I tried to use the guided schedule setting in the app. Choosing to modify the whole week with the same schedule caused it to get stuck after away settings. Clicking “next” did nothing. So I tried to modify just the weekend. That worked. Then when I tried to modify the weekdays, I couldn’t deselect the weekends (touching the days or the weekend button didn’t toggle the selected days). So again I forced to modify the whole week, which again got stuck at the first screen. You get my frustration. 

This app is not intuitive, gets few updates, the menu system is not well thought out, and often just doesn’t do what it’s supposed to do. The fact that Carrier hasn’t fixed these problems in years makes me wonder about the quality of their heating and cooling systems.";"2019-12-01T07:33:49-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=941486794&type=Purple%20Software";"941486794";253;"en";"NEGATIVE"

1. It doesn’t work in landscape mode on the phone... SO WHAT!, I mean it makes sense that it might, but it doesn’t, big deal - if the heartache and pain you have to go through to turn your phone 90 is sooo overwhelming, you need to find better things to do with your life.

2. You can’t swipe up to close the app.... actually you can - from the landscape you’ll see the little white bar, swipe up and ‘voila’ app closed.

3.  I had to figure out that 3 taps on the screen will get you back to the main screen - got lucky with that one because I was a little frustrated

All in all, the programming for this is not all that “intuitive”, and it could be more user friendly for ease of use in today’s world of apps, but it does the job.  And let’s remember this is for your thermostat - it’s not a video game, this is intended to be a set it and forget it..minor changes every once in a while... 

So there, that’s my review - the app works just freakin fine. It’s basic, and I’m sure there are ones out there with a bunch of other bells and whistles - but really, what all do you need.";"2019-08-12T10:24:24-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=941486794&type=Purple%20Software";"941486794";290;"en";"POSITIVE"

Update: we had a power outage today. Now the app on my phone won’t work, period. I’ve spent almost 6 hours trying to figure out why. 

Here’s my bottom line: Carrier doesn’t seem to care about connectivity. At least not with this app. And when you go to their website, you see another stark indicator of this. Worse yet, their “help” is a robot. Totally useless. Even worse yet, their suggestions for reuniting their app with their gear seems to require a PHD in network systems. 

The Cor thermostat isn’t as smart as Carrier suggests, just like their website interface to manage your energy usage is seemingly non-existent. 

Companies that install this gear are doing a tremendous disfavor to their customers. We spent $14,000 for a brand new system, and now we’re controlling it with something only slightly better than smoke signals. 

It makes me wonder how good the equipment I bought is, you know? If my new 3 ton heat pump can heat my house, why can’t I turn the heat up at midnight from my bed with my phone when it’s 25 degrees outside?

Do not accept this thermostat if your installer brings it into your house. Check your bid to make sure it isn’t specified.

That has happened in the past when iOS upgrades, this time it seems like a longer wait. The other reviews are correct: Often it will reflect a setting change on the app but not actually change the thermostat.  It also will show a different temperature than the thermostat. Setting the schedule can be a real chore as it doesn’t always update the in app schedule or alternatively does but fails to actually change the thermostat itself. I’ve had a lot of trouble with the Cor thermostat itself being inaccurate so my recommendation would be if purchasing a new Carrier heating/AC system consider a different/better thermostat first.

If I could give the thermostat itself five stars, I would. 

The app, however, needs some work. I agree with the other reviews... Needs to work without automatically going into landscape mode. I see why the developers have done this... Makes it feel like you're actually in front of the thermostat. I still don't like it. 

The reason for this review is in the hopes that the software developers read it and find out that THERE IS A PROBLEM. Whenever I change my temperature setting through the app, it doesn't work.

It's janky, ugly, and totally nonsensical in its design and navigation. Why they thought it would be a good idea to try and emulate the actual thermostats UI instead of making it work with native phone controls is insane. 

Hence my excitement to see they added HomeKit support. Finally, an interface I can enjoy by not using this crappy app! Except it doesn't work. At all. 

Here's the thing: these Cor devices are just rebranded Ecobee thermostats. They use Ecobee's backend API and at least some of Ecobee's hardware. Yet Ecobee's apps and devices UI are second to none. Beautiful and intuitive.  Carrier can be forgiven for building a crappy app-- god knows there's a million home automation apps with god awful UIs-- but Carrier is apparently so bad at this that they actually MADE AN EXISTING PRODUCT WORSE and slapped their logo on it.

The UI is exactly like the thermostat on the wall so you don’t have to learn two different layouts. I will say the layout has a pretty steep learning curve, so be warned (if you’ve been using the actual thermostat you’ll know what I mean). The app is a pain to setup (you need a code from your thermostat that isn’t where they tell you it is...) but once it’s set up the system responds quickly to changes made via the app so that’s good. My biggest issue with the app is what others have noted - the app is landscape, which makes it very hard to use. I don’t know if portrait would be much better, though. Since it’s the same UI as the thermostat portrait mode might be kind of small on an iPhone, but I’d like to have the option to choose which layout works best for me.
