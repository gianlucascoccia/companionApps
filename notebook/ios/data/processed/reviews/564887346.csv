Some wired units had to be replaced for failure to connect - may be my fault for mis-wirring. I'm giving them the benefit of doubt. I've bought range extenders. I've changed outdoor timers. I have my primary wired with lots of lamps and outdoor lights on a schedule. I have cameras to monitor my vacation home - which was a primary factor in my purchase. It took lots of tech support to get the cameras operating correctly for remote viewing, but when working they were great.

Lots of upfront cost, BUT I prefer that over monthly fees some systems require. I don't like the fact that I can't have more than one schedule to come on at sunset - everything that turns on at sunset must go off at the same time.

Now I go on vacation and I can't connect. My lake house alarm goes off and my alarm app tells me it's a motion sensor. Insteon fails to connect and I can't see inside. I can't connect to anything. I get home and still can't connect. I can't even connect inside my primary residence. Frustrating is an understatement. Is this a result of the hubs planned - and then delayed - updated?";"2017-05-29T10:31:36-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=564887346&type=Purple%20Software";"564887346";221;"en";"NEGATIVE"

I may only care about an alert at a certain time of day or day of the week. My garage door app has that and it makes a lot of sense.

Update:
Please make some updates to the feature set of this app. Allow for multiple schedules per device or seen. Allow time flexibility within those schedules so it doesn’t look like a computer is turning the lights on and off every day.

I downgraded the rating because this app gets updated once a year and even then it’s not adding new features.

For those who have multiple sites under ""House Management: Current House"", you need to fix the app so that the user can chose the current house at startup. At the present, the app defaults to the last chosen Current House, and this leads to preventing the user from connecting to any of their Houses, if the last house chosen has lost power. In the event of a power failure, the App ALWAYS continues to connect to the house with no power when that was the last house chosen, which prevents the user to connecting to any house, as there is no way to get to the settings menu to allow the user to change to a house that has power, so the app becomes useless for any account that has multiple houses.  There needs to be a user choice at startup to allow the user to switch Current House settings in the event that the app cannot connect to the last setting, in the case that either the server cannot be reached for any reason: power outage, internet connection problems, etc... you get the point.";"2018-03-06T06:43:37-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=564887346&type=Purple%20Software";"564887346";204;"en";"NEGATIVE"

Insteon is not user friendly nor is it flexible, compatible with other systems, or capable of some basic type of programming. 

For example, you cannot use a sensor to turn on a light for 10 minutes (or any other duration). 

You cannot have two scenes (programs) that start at the same time (e.g., sunset). The app actually tells you to combine the scenes. That does a user no good, if the scenes are supposed to end at different times (or duration... if the app actually supported durations).

Insteon, please update the app and your hub to modern standards.

Follow-up: I tried using Alexa with the hub/app. That also barely works. Alexa shows notes that it cannot control scenes. Also, if you say, ""Turn off the porch light,"" Alexa does not work, because it does not know it is a light. It only understands, ""Turn off the porch.""  It is a bit of a bigger deal with the garage door opener, because it is much more unnatural to say, ""Turn on garage door"" to open the garage. 

Insteon, please add interoperability with Wink.  Their hub is hardware agnostic and works well for programming different scenarios and works well with Alexa.";"2017-07-06T12:26:13-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=564887346&type=Purple%20Software";"564887346";218;"en";"POSITIVE"

And that's about the only thing good I can say about it. From the obscenely loud button beeps you can't turn off to having to dismiss a useless, non-working initial control screen to get to the actual control screen... there's just too many irritating things about the app that keeps it from being a tool you want to use. What's even more inexplicable is how the app recognizes specific sensors... like a garage door opener... but had a confusing and generic interface for it. Is having the app say ""Door Open"" and ""Door Closed"" instead of the cryptic ""Relay Open"" and ""Sensor Closed"" really too difficult? Why isn't there a preset configuration for the FanLink switch that automatically populates the light on/off and fan speed buttions? Configuring that monster manually is not just horribly difficult, but you don't get actual radio buttons that light up properly.

Installation was fairly easy and the one problem I had was very adeptly handled by Insteon support team. 

I put the switches into several scenes and onto sunrise/sunset timers and everything  performed flawlessly for the last 14 months.

Now I'm in a bit deeper. Over the last few days, I swapped out 74 more switches and added a few dimmer modules and four outdoor controllers for my landscape lights. I also added 20 leak detectors. 

I was incredibly pleased by the fact that not a single device failed to function properly during installation. They all communicated flawlessly with the Insteon Hub and are now assigned to their various rooms and scenes and behaving well. 

I find the iPhone app to be quite easy and intuitive to use. There are a few things I'd tweak if I were in charge, including allowing for more flexible scheduling, conditional events and allowing and offset to the sunset/sunrise times, but these are all ""nice to haves"" not ""must haves"". 

All my switches are the 2477D model. 

Alexa works perfectly after reworking my naming conventions to suit her demands (hint: if you have a three-way switch, name the primary switch, for example, ""family floods"" and switches two and three ""fam flds 2"" and ""fam flds 3""). 

I'm a big fan of my Insteon setup, so am puzzled by all the negative reviews.  My guess is most of the reported problems are user errors.";"2017-06-14T16:03:14-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=564887346&type=Purple%20Software";"564887346";265;"en";"POSITIVE"

I have not been able to add certain devices to scenes that have never been a problem with other applications, icons only show two lines for the name under the icon which truncates things often and there is no way to reorder the icons which aren't in any particular order. Note that you can only configure the hub from an iOS device - no web interface, no programming from the Insteon connect cloud offering and nothing on Mac or PC.

There is no manual & the app interface is not very intuitive, requiring you to call tech support for many answers.  The software/hardware combination doesn't reliably communicate with the Insteon devices. I set up one scene just fine, but adding a second using the same lights resulted in unreliable reporting of  device status & lighting levels no matter what I did.  The second scene took some values from the first scene repeatedly making it's use problematic. 

I have spent many hours trying to set up automated lighting with this App & their Hub, but it has been a frustrating undertaking with 1 defective hub, several app reinstalls and hours of work by myself & their great tech support staff.

I had originally planned to use a different app after I got all of my Insteon switches installed but this one works fine so I haven't bothered to switch. 

The best thing about the app is the ability to see all of my lights and sensors in one place. In seconds I can tell if any lights were left on and if any doors are open. I can then turn off any lights that are on (open doors, unfortunately, can't be closed remotely 😊). 

Once the app is loaded up lights respond instantly which is a big improvement over other brands I've tried. 

Scheduling works great. I'm not sure why some people have trouble with it but mine is easy and flawless. My pool is on one timer and I have various lights on other timers. Especially useful is having the ability to have lights set to turn on at sunset and off at sunrise. 

All that said, the app isn't perfect. It can take a good fifteen to thirty or more seconds to start up. That means you never just pull out you iPhone to turn on/off a nearby light. It's great for checking all lights but not so great individually. 

Also, the layout is a bit cumbersome what with devices, rooms and scenes and then having status vs edit in different places. Even now I almost always go to the wrong place to edit a device.

-Setup is relatively easy, however adding devices via the sync feature doesn't work as well as manually entering in the device ID, so if you have a home full of numerous Insteon devices prepare an Excel spreadsheet before mounting your switch plates.
-The app occasionally takes a long time to load.
-No Roomie support, device list does not manifest
-Devices randomly stop working after hours or days of successful functionality.

-No notifications
-No support for sensors 
-No support for IP cameras

The list goes on, I'm just hoping Insteon provides several major updates especially considering the new WWDC HomeKit announcements.

But it's held back by software such as this app. Consider:
1) There's not a way to back up / restore your entire house's configuration - not on the hub, not offline. If a lighting strike messes it up (which happened to me, even though I have a whole-house surge suppressor installed), you need to reset everything and start from scratch. From scratch!
2) There's no officially supported synchrony among configurations done via this app / hub, in the House Link desktop application, and locally on the devices. Unofficially there's evidence of engineering bias to push whatever capability the switches/devices can support by themselves, onto them - which is good as it minimizes a single point of failure / bottleneck. But you can't officially have a clear view yet if a particular scene or config resides in the device, in the hub, or in the software.

I've set up one of two plug in modules that came in the kit. Module synced with router after touching button below arrow buttons. Light is very responsive to app both on timer and manual touch. 

Only kicker...older house with tall baseboards. The size of the module covers both outlets when in top plug. Cool tool - but I loose 2 sockets for every module. I have to use top plug, because the module only has a plug for the light at the very bottom. If it had a plug port at the sides or top...would be highly functional in design. Having it at bottom only causes our cable to clash with trim and not sit in outlet safely.

I still had to call customer support to help add some of the cameras but that was with an older version of the app. I added the last 2 cameras using the newest version myself and I'm not very techy. When I refer to adding cameras, I'm including the ability to view them remotely when not at home which requires port forwarding of your router. If you only want to view while home and connected to wifi, the process is simpler, but once installed everything has worked well. I also use the Apple Watch application and that all works well also. You have great control of most of your devices through the watch and can even view the cameras. Amazon's Echo also works with this format.   I don't understand all the negative reviews, if you have any problems, call the free technical support line. They are very accessible and knowledgeable about the devices. Sometimes there are long waits, but they have a great system where they ring you back when it's your turn in line. There is also a Insteon/ Smarthome forum with some brilliant users willing to help figure out most problems if you need additional help. The Insteon hub and app is a great way for anyone with little or no experience with home automation to get started and of the apps available for Insteon that I've looked at, this one does the most and works the best when using the non-Apple HomeKit compatible Insteon hub.

However I consistantly have problems getting Smarthome / Insteon to recognize users like myself who have multiple locations.  Lets look at the latest example on Insteon for HUB.

Instead of thinking  (location, room, device) hierachy.  You must login all the way to the last location you have selected, go to setting, then house management and then pick your other location, at which time it re-logins to that location.   

(1) Scenario: Now image you have 4 locations like I do.  And the power fails at that location (being the last one you used).   You can't login (cause there is no power at this location),you get a ""FAIL"" message.  Because you can't login.. you can't get to setting to change locations.... You are ""locked out"" of all 4 locations.

(2) These hubs have been around at least a year now and the web app, still won't do thermostats, and will only do the first location you setup the account on.

(3) The older smartlinc's which are all failing one by one...(I have 1 left still working out of 5), would allow you to directly access them through a web interface, but now with the hubs, you don't have direct access to a web server on the device.   The old smartlinc app (similar to this one) also required you to ""login"" to the first one in alphabetical order...but at least that one when it gave you the ""fail"" message would eventually allow you to choose another location.

Blocked out at (1), (2), and (3).   Frustrating";"2014-11-29T09:42:30-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=564887346&type=Purple%20Software";"564887346";273;"en";"NEGATIVE"

I had been using similar software in the past (X10). Best thing this software provides for me is the capability to monitor and/or change lighting remotely.  However, I am not sure how the system recovers from a power outage.  I suspect that it is able to recover your settings via internet connection to your account but it is not clear how that will affect scheduled lighting (e.g., will the system turn on a light that would have already been on if there was no power outage).

The software has a limitation that only allows one device or scene to be schedule to go on or off at a particular time.   It does include the capability to schedule for sunset / sunrise but there is no capability to adjust the calculated sunset / sunrise times to have your security lighting appear more natural (keep from having all/many of your lights going on / off at once).  There is capability to create scenes where you can group devices or setup manual on/off times but these times would have to be manually  adjusted coincide with the changing length of day/night hours. 

Hopefully, this application will get better as times goes on.  I have included a list below of some capabilities I wish it included now or in the future.

Be able to create schedules at the device level (sunset / sunrise), including ability to offset the calculated on/off time to make lighting appear more natural / lived-in.
Rearrange icons on Favorites or Room screens to make it easier to use.  It appears the icons are being arranged in alphabetical order only.
Would be nice to have separate Edit selections for each type of thing (Favorites, Devices, Scenes).   Currently there is only one Edit selection pointing to one of the types.  You have to select a different type before you can Edit it.

Update 6/5/15

Hope sales of new hub versions will benefit app improvement. #Invest

Takes 10-15 seconds for app to ""log in"". Way too long and inconvenient. 

Quicker now. But ideally would be great to be around one second.

Also, it'd be great if the app would stay open in the background. It often doesn't. More delays/latency on app login...

Moving dimmer slider erroneously pulls side bar controls open.  

1) Give me more icons to choose from or let me upload custom ones

2) Let me choose to show the full device control screen by default. I use these controls every time. Having to tap the added + step is a drag.

3) Give me test controls in the device adding sequence like SmartLinc...

4) Give the ability to edit device setting while in the 'Edit this' room screen. I can change names and icons but not device settings

5) Ability to reorder devices in rooms & scenes etc

6) Timers - a random feature would be nice for vacation or when away.

7) The timer conflicts are very irritating.

8) Sunset/Sunrise offset options would be awesome.

Or I want sunset scene on and then off 4 hours after sunset. Without complicated workarounds.

What is that give it five stars. Took me a while since thedocumentation is not real intuitive figured out how scenes and rooms work. FYI using this on an iPhone 6s and an iPad. No software issues.

This app works absolutely great! No issues at all easy to set up but has one BIG BIG problem... it cannot turn off LED bulbs!!! They dim to almost off but they can't ever turn off completely I confirmed this with a call to their support team. It seems that the modules need to have power all the time in order to connect to your Wi-Fi and the LEDs pick up on that and will power themselves on and cannot be turned completely off as long as that power source is there. Big big disappointment! It says nothing on the box about this issue although Support says it's a known issue.

One other major problem is that unless you've been living in a hole under ground somewhere with no media contact at all, incandescent bulbs have been outlawed and you will soon no longer be able to buy them or if you can they will be very very expensive!!!";"2017-09-10T16:40:29-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=564887346&type=Purple%20Software";"564887346";323;"en";"NEGATIVE"

DO NOT UPDATE!!!

I updated to the newest version in hopes it would resolve the sign out issue when attempting to use my watch to control my devices. The issue still exists where if the app is not running in the background prior to using my watch the app signs you out and your credentials have to be re-entered to sign back in. At least in the previous version you could click on back and then login which would auto-populate your credentials but now you're just completely signed out. PLEASE FIX THIS. 

If you're not using an Apple Watch the update is a huge improvement on the 6 & 6+ devices. But otherwise I really regret updating to this version

The app by itself is very functional and with a few updates could be perfect. Apple Watch integration is very broken and only works if you open the app on your phone prior to interacting with it on the watch.  After the app has been opened EVERYTHING works as expected. But if you quit the app (actually exit and close the app) the watch will still display your devices but will not communicate or send commands. The app ""appears"" to log you out but if you click on ""back"" then click ""already have account"" it will log you in without having to re-enter credentials. Please fix the authentication issue.";"2015-07-16T18:30:10-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=564887346&type=Purple%20Software";"564887346";231;"en";"POSITIVE"

I have 8 switches that I formerly controlled with a 2412n and 1 IP camera.  I love that I can now see all of these in one app. I also love:
how easily the devices paired,
the user interface, and
the single setup for all attached devices

The cons are:
No conditional logic in the hub,
Lack of landscape mode, especially in the iPad app

I am also concerned about its reliability/longevity  as I went through 2 2412s that just quit working.";"2014-09-14T20:17:12-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=564887346&type=Purple%20Software";"564887346";88;"en";"POSITIVE"
