Home/away mode. Away mode works fine. Home mode hit and miss. Sometime it doesn't register I am home and doesn't start home mode automatically, but only after launching app which was in background. Otherwise it will start home mode only after I have walk through the door which is also when I connect to my home wifi and tado knows I am home positively. Seldom I will come home with the Aircon temp already set nicely. For the above I have set my home geo fence to the smallest radius which they did warned will not be reliable. I have increased the radius and will update back here again.

Could give better control over the function that automatically turns off the Aircon when a set temperature is hit. Currently I can only set a single range +/- same temp ie 2deg lower it will cut off, 2 deg warmer it will turn back on.

Obviously the developer had a change of heart to switch from subscription pricing to one-time upgrade fee (at least for legacy customers, don’t know how it is for new customers)

That makes a huge difference. Updating my rating from one to four stars correspondingly.
I’m glad this was changed!

Original Review
=================

The whole point of buying their devices was maximal energy savings, of which the software is an integral part.

That now, after people have spent lots of money to buy into their system, they start to charge monthly fees to use something we already bought, is outrageous.

Imagine this sets an example: you convert your home to hue lighting, then Philips starts to charge a subscription fee for the app.
Apple sells you an iPhone, then starts charging a monthly fee for using iOS.
You buy a sofa, a year later the carpenter stops by and installs a meter that charges you a cent each time you sit down.

If you add some serious functionality, charge for the upgrade, letting me choose if I need the features or not. But stop beings leeches who think they deserve an income stream for perpetuity for work done and paid to employees one time only.";"2018-12-19T05:16:02-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=574418486&type=Purple%20Software";"574418486";229;"en";"POSITIVE"

Had to wait for custom instructions for installation because my existing thermostat and heating configuration wasn’t pre-loaded into Tado’s automated installation instructions program.  When I did finally get the instructions via email it caused my separately-controlled in-floor heating in my kitchen (operating off the same boiler and boiler controller as all the room thermostats) to stop working - at least the radiators kept working. 

To top it all off, I also cannot create and assign individual room names to each of my radiator thermostats which prevents me from controlling them individually from my phone.  This was a big reason why I wanted this product!!
 Instead, I keep getting an annoying message that says 

 “Assignment to new room by user not possible yet.  To reassign the device to a new room please contact our Technical Support.  You can find the number for your country in our Help Center.”

This seems to be such a simple but critical update and easy problem to solve - why the heck hasn’t Tado fixed this yet!?!

Now you can no longer do that. Even though the device itself supports swinging, the lousy preset Tado made doesn’t, so I used to program it in myself. I had to factory reset due to getting a different model AC and now this feature is gone. 

This is what their support team had to say

 “We are sorry to inform you that it is not possibile to register single commands (like swings). Unfortunately, with the new software release, this possibility is no more supported because it was too time consuming.  We apologize for the inconvenience.”

Basically, even though I was willing to go through the trouble, they decided for the consumer that it wasn’t necessary. Competing IR blasters let you do manual inputs, yes it takes time.

The worst part is the “Teach Tado” option is in the app and on the website still, it simply doesn’t work. Essentially this is false advertising.

It's a bit tedious to set up as my particular brand was not supported. But once that was done it works very well. The location sensing is a great feature and apart from a weird glitch once in a while it's pretty reliable. My only complaint is that the time setting do not seem to work. It's off by exactly 6 hours and so my set on/off times are off by the same 6 hours. Strangely enough that's the time difference between my location and Munich where I see the HQ is located. 

Overall a great product and easy to use app but a few bugs to work out. Looking forward to the Siri integration.";"2016-12-22T16:24:56-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=574418486&type=Purple%20Software";"574418486";131;"en";"POSITIVE"

and I couldn't find any instruction reseting the smartAC control, but eventually I figured it out. but now I am stuck with the app not being able to remove the control, so I can re-register the control with the app and with the new AC unit and address.
I couldn’t logout in the app, only way I found is to uninstall and reinstall the app, but eventually my login still has loaded with the previous setting of the control, which render me unable to setup the device I have reseted. 
I even tried to login on Tado's web service, I was able to change the pin on the map, but the address above the map cannot be changed!";"2015-06-17T18:07:09-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=574418486&type=Purple%20Software";"574418486";138;"en";"NEGATIVE"

My AC unit goes between 60 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit. It's in direct line of sight to the unit. 

Please, please, PLEEEEASE just give us an up and down control button! I don't need all the fancy energy saving options, I just want simple manual control. Is your API ready? I'll program it myself ;)

Also, does the device have an audio sensor? Maybe it could recognize device beeps? Not sure if you guys included that in the device. 

I waited over a year for the kickstarter, the device is great but your app is extremely limited.";"2015-08-10T20:25:49-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=574418486&type=Purple%20Software";"574418486";132;"en";"POSITIVE"
