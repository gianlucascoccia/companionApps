I can’t believe more people haven’t used the app or bought the lock. Been over 2yrs and I haven’t even changed the AA batteries - still 36% battery. I use AppleTV and HomeKit, I tell my phone all the time to lock or check if it locked/unlocked. Works great with the iWatch and always responsive almost always within 5seconds the lock is activated. I have had a few issues here and there, no more than any other electronic device that’s works nearly flawless. I bought two more Sense locks for the other doors a year later. Quality built construction lock, just keep working on the app and I will continue to tell others this is a must buy tool for a smart home and a seamless way to monitor the locks throughout.

I called Schlage customer service on a Saturday. They are not open weekends. I called them Monday. They told me to log out and unistall the app to reset it. I installed it and logged back in. That did not fix the issue. After over week, my app is unable to re-connect to my lock remotely. The old codes I put it still work, except the temporary ones. I am unable to record the history of activity, add new codes, unlock and lock it, etc. I realize only after I bought this lock, that I cannot use it remotely. I have to physically be there to reset the app if it gets disconnected. That is a gamechanger and an expensive mistake.

Having the same button to toggle locked/unlocked can be problematic, as can having the majority of the screen act as the toggle button. I tried to swipe up to get to multitask mode to get into another app, and in the process ended up sending an unlock command to the door. Thankfully I was at home and heard it unlock itself, but if I had been away from home, it may have left my door unlocked without my knowledge. Also, if the app is still open and processing a command when you lock the phone, a command may be sent, then upon unlocking the phone, the app may send a repeat command, which again can be problematic if the app inadvertently sends a second unlock command hours later when you are away from home. An option to get a notification when the lock has been unlocked for more than x amount of time would be nice.
On the plus side, the lock/unlock notifications are handy, as is the autolock option, though customizable time increments would be appreciated.";"2020-09-01T05:53:39-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1038212933&type=Purple%20Software";"1038212933";179;"en";"POSITIVE"

Basically, none of us have to think of these things, the lock does the heavy lifting for us.

(1) App should support notification on low battery, arguably more useful than notification on lock/unlock. Battery replacement events should go into history and notifications. 
(2) App should support lock/unlock notification by door and by a schedule (e.g., notify me if the door on the side of the house is unlocked between the hours of 10 PM and 6 AM). 

General User Interface: Main page for each lock has (1) one large padlock-looking icon that is colored red for locked state, green for unlocked state, and which can be tapped to lock/unlock, (2) a button to show lock/unlock history, and (3) a battery meter (when battery is low). For owners of more than one lock, one must swipe L/R to see each lock. That main page should show a scrolling list of locks with a smaller padlock icon in the left column, the history button in the center column, and the battery meter in the right column for each lock. I.e., please implement a higher information density solution so that owners can immediately see that all locks are locked. 

Battery Life: I only get six months from a fresh set of batteries (on 3 different Schlage Encode locks). Not an issue with the app, per se, but I’m sharing for those considering Schlage smart locks.

Dead bolt install was easy. It came with a reinforcement plate on the door jam side for added security.  It is larger then the standard plate and you will need to chisel out a larger recess in the door jam to make it fit.  I recommend a decent chisel and a small drill bit to pilot the larger screws holes.  If you don’t use the pilot drill bit you will risk splitting the wood.   Fatal error. 

This dead bolt works well with security screen doors because it has a thin profile on the exterior side of the door, leaving plenty of room for the security screen doors knob.

After months of frustration, I have finally figured out what was causing my remote access issues no thanks to Schlage or Apple. 

For those of you with lingering issues using it remotely with an Apple TV HD, ensure the following

1) on your Apple TV, make sure that airplay is “On”. You ALSO MUST enable “also allow nearby to airplay“. 

2) after that, you will need to turn off all nearby iOS devices and lock. After rebooting your Apple TV, turn on the lock again and ensure that it connects with your Apple TV.  You can verify if it is connected by asking your Siri my remote if the lock is locked or unlocked. Once connected, it will maintain a connection with your Apple TV

3) now, you should be able to turn on your iOS devices and no longer have issues.

Note:  If you Continue to have issues, you may either need to reset your lock back to factory defaults or you may have Bluetooth interference.

Wrong.

Connectivity regularly fails. No matter if you’re using the HomeKit UI or Schlage a own app, there is apparently a difficulty connecting to the lock. 

Recently, Schlage or Apple released an update and since that update you have to be right next to the lock for it to work. We have this years iPhones so our equipment isn’t out of date.

Newer locks (V3 or V4?) have no issues; wish Schlage would replace ALL older defective locks.

1. Call Schlage, tell them what they already know. That these things are junk. They won't argue with you. Demand a refund... even if it has been 14 months since you bought them.
2. Email them your receipts and serial numbers.
3. Get your refund check.

Most apps today allow for shortcuts to interface with app.  So you can use Siri to run a shortcut when the app is not Siri comparable.  Not this app…

Most apps have a quick action menu so you don’t have to open the app for common commands. A nice quick action menu would be to lock and unlock a “primary” lock.  Not this app…

This app lacks basic functionality by today’s standards, and is useless with regards to security.
