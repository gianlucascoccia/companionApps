The cameras and video are so finicky. Sometimes it captures stuff and many times it doesn’t (naturally when I need it to it fails)
I feel like if I don’t “snooze” the notifications at night I get woken up with alerts all through the night (including because of bugs flying in front of the camera)
Of course because you can only go back 2 hours to review (if you don’t pay for the subscription) you may not have a recording what you need.
I’ve had problems with the lights coming on even though the setting in the app is off and not on motion or I’ve turned them off through the app it comes back on. Plenty of times I’ve just had to flip the inside switch to off. But mostly all the activity that is misses is bothersome and disappointing.";"2020-12-18T10:43:13-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951258324&type=Purple%20Software";"951258324";175;"en";"NEGATIVE"

It works fine (though video/audio is very laggy/freezes) and then for no reason the wifi connection stops working. The only way to resolve the issue is to reboot the entire device including reconnecting to the app, reconnecting to the wifi, etc. This is a pain and more trouble than it’s worth. At first I called my wifi provider and they could recognize the other smart devices connected to the wifi but they had no indication that the kuna doorbell was even attempting to try to connect to the wifi. I called kuna support the first time and they just said reboot the whole thing. This solved the issue for about a month then went out again for no reason (all other devices continues functioning as normal, no power outage, nothing). Im tired of paying money for a service whose free version I cant even take advantage of since the smart doorbell is now a dumb doorbell. It just acts like a normal doorbell, cant record or show anything. Also even when it did work, it would ghost ring randomly - it would ring and I’d check the door and check the camera history and no one was there.

So I tried putting caulking anywhere that water could get in but that didn’t work either. They still get water inside. Now the pictures on 2 of the cameras is not viewable due to what looks like lines running through picture, and taking them down to dry out is not a good option because who wants to get a ladder out every time it rains to take down so they can be dried out? I sent 1 back while it was under warranty. They took my new camera and gave me a refurbished camera. I have frequently checked connectivity and the numbers are always excellent, around -53. I even went out and bought a new WiFi system to make sure I had good connectivity but that made no difference! I would say buyer beware!

Wifi disconnects and reconnects to my network about once every 5 minutes. There is a chance this is due to my mesh network (but it’s the only way I can get reliable wifi to my smart home). This wifi bug is a long standing issue and I really hope they fix it as the hardware misses visits during this disconnect/reconnect. 

Update cubed: delete and reinstall app to fix the current set of bugs 🐛 

Another update: I have to power cycle these lights every few weeks or so else they become unreliable. In order to pick up night time activity, the AI sensitivity must be turned up extremely high. Clean spider webs 🕸 on a very regular basis else you’ll both miss alerts and get ghost alerts. 

Below is my old review. I’ve since added two more lights and have turned on AI for alerts which have changed the entire way these cameras sense people and cars. There is a lot of configuration available for the AI alerts and tweaking them all takes time!
The night sensitivity is distinctly less than daytime, but I’m still configuring AI so maybe I’ve yet to tune things in correctly. 
Kuna stopped alerting when holiday sounds have been added so I just have to keep checking the app to see if Halloween, Thanksgiving 🦃, or other holiday sounds have been added. 
Each camera style is slightly different in its night time lighting and glare. The original square camera probably has the worst glare of them all even with the additional glare blocks added, the best at lighting is probably the huge swooping light with glass that isn’t completely fogged. 
Overall great replacement for door lights!
—-
I installed the first one on the back door. Initially I received a lot of false alarms but it was pretty clear from the video that my trees were setting it off. I turned down the sensitivity to 75% and almost all false positives immediately disappeared.

The tiny camera shade had to be swapped out for one that was in the included plastic bag; this greatly decreased night glare and increased the night distance and color quality of the light. 

After a month with the back yard light I installed one on the front door and it’s performed perfectly. I may have to adjust sensitivity for blowing plants but haven’t had to yet!

The light isn’t perfect but I love it for what it is. As always these cameras require good WiFi -outdoors- where they’re installed. Most problem installs are probably related to people not understanding WiFi signal quality. A repeater near the light -might- fix most of these problems (depending on the house!)

Not too happy. I’ve reported my problems with their system. But all they would say is my fault. Cameras always going out. But I do have to say it takes great day pictures of all the cars driving by. One of my cameras went crazy and would not stop recording. I did everything they asked me to. To much money for the bad experience. I find that when I first put up the lights. They worked great. But they did something to the system programing and now they really do not work the way they should. I have walked in front of the cameras and they did nothing and on the way back it video me coming in front of it. 
Just ways they need to fix it. The area that the smart program is, it will video pass that area in blue. Now it will alert me that car or person detected but there’s no video of it.

I have them set to come on at sunset and go off at sunrise. The LED bulbs use very little electricity and the light is a strong deterrent. With the lights on, the cameras have no problem at all detecting persons or vehicles. I find the detection to be more reliable, with many fewer falses, than my Ring Pro doorbell. Also, the speakers are nice and loud — hardly anybody can hear me when I speak through the Ring. As soon as the Maximus Answer doorbell camera is available, I will be replacing the Ring.

I love that these things are so stealthy. No one ever seems to notice that a camera is there until it’s too late — they’ve been captured on video! The automated greeting is a further deterrent. It usually startles them and leaves no doubt that their presence has been detected.  My only complaint, up until now, has been that there wasn’t an appropriate greeting for every situation. For my backyard, I wanted something very aggressive, because no one has any business being in my walled and gated (locked) backyard. But, for my front yard, I didn’t want to sound obnoxious to the UPS guy.  I needed a greeting that simply advised that they were being recorded on video.

Then after about five month the Front camera light went blind while the light part of it was still working and following schedule settings and nothing was able to resuscitate the camera part. A few month later the same thing happened to the Back door camera light. I’m now the proud owner of two Expensive fake camera lights. I have the top Fios Fiberoptic cable internet connection, a NightHawk R9000 router providing a powerful wifi signal and three other brands of camera (SV3C, Uokoo, Wyze) connected here and there around the house. They never failed me while they cost for some of them less than a fraction of the price  of kuna. I tend to think that not upgrading to a monthly subscription  has triggered some kind of targeted appliance failure. Look... they do their best for you to upgrade, no microSD card, no other option for you to save your videos locally, very little option if none in the app to take real control of your device, no factory reset.
Honestly for the price of a Kuna camera light you nearly buy more than 5 pan and tilt $40 Wyze cameras that would do the same thing but the light and keep your old light there.

Sometimes when they go offline, you have to manually re-add a camera which is horribly inconvenient, especially since the app doesn’t remember the settings you used when you last added the camera, so everything needs to be set again. I don’t know why a camera that has gone offline doesn’t remember its settings, but the only time it does remember and go back online on its own is when the power goes out. 

I’ve also had at least one issue where no recording was made, even though I received a notification. I could view the activity in real time, but for some reason no recording was ever made.

Kuna support is reachable, but they haven’t been able to offer a solution for any of the aforementioned problems. For $10/month (I have two cameras), the cost is steep given the issues. When I’m away from home on travel, if a camera goes offline, I’m out of luck until I return home, which defeats the purpose of having these.

There’s also no HomeKit support for Kuna products, nor IR for better vision at night.

Some days, we’ll get 35 notifications stating it has gone on and offline, and other days, it won’t go back online until we reset our WiFi or power off the camera at the source (which is a pain since it is on a short-term rental that we can’t access all the time). Many times, video footage also won’t fully download, so 25%+ of the footage becomes useless.

Figure you'll spend around $100 for a nice lamp and another $100 for a good outdoor camera, the price balances out since this camera is $150-$180 for Kuna depending on style. Now, this is the App Store so I'll quickly summarize the product, but not sure if other folks give it a bad rap due to ""operator error"" or maybe they just received faulty products. This camera is a breeze to set up and connect to wifi. It has a great wide angle and the functions work consistently; the app lets you adjust the sensitivity threshold and even after your free premium trial ends, assuming you live in a relatively safe area, you don't need to buy the monthly subscription (although at $4/month you can hardly complain if you want to subscribe). The app lets you download the clips of folks coming to your door (they only store on the app for so long so you want to download to be sure you save them) and record longer lengths up to 2 minutes of activity manually. I would like to see the ability to record to your own server in future models and not just their cloud service. The app has a few prerecorded messages which are fine (I do really really wish it let you pre-record your own) and they even put fun ones on there for holidays (Christmas, etc.). Occasionally if you aren't connected to strong wifi where you are, the camera signal strength cuts out but that's reasonable. Otherwise picture is clear and great for the price and audio is super sensitive (you could be 20+ feet away and still pick up some audio as I did just this afternoon). You can control light on/off settings, snooze settings, etc. Could the app be more powerful/feature loaded? Yes, absolutely, but again, for the price this is an awesome product and there aren't others offered like it. I'm in love with my kuna and definitely prefer it to the ring doorbell.";"2017-03-20T09:21:02-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951258324&type=Purple%20Software";"951258324";355;"en";"POSITIVE"

First, for a subscription to be worth it, it will have to use better discretion in issuing alerts. On a really windy day, I'll get a dozen alerts in a hour from the shadows cast by swaying tree branches or a potted plant alone. There is an option in settings to turn down the sensitivity, but if you dial that back too far, then it won't be triggered by the mailman. An algorithm which is able to distinguish human forms or faces would make it smarter than the average $20 motion detecting floodlight, and that would add crucial value to the device.

Secondly, maybe a premium subscription option would give the option to record constantly, and offer a log of motion-activated events before rolling it off of their servers after fifteen days or a month, just like professional surveillance systems do. I would consider that valuable because...

Thirdly, Kuna misses some trigger-worthy events. I'll sometimes walk right past it and get no notification, or the mailman won't set it off, and for a security service, that's kind of unsettling.

Fourth, the lag can be rough, especially when using the intercom. Often, I'll try to talk to people who come to my door with the intercom function, but by the time I've received a notification, they've already walked out of earshot.

Last, and this seems like the easiest fix, it doesn't work with my Bluetooth headphones. I have to assume that's the case with all BT speakers and Kuna's software, which is a rough deal for me, because I'm often in a high-noise environment, and that iPhone speaker is just not going to cut it.

All that having been said, I think the Kuna is a great concept, the camera is great, the feed is okay most of the time. If I had only one wish, it would be for the device to record directly to a storage device that is on-site for the end user. Of course, that would mean cutting Kuna away from the responsibilities of maintaining support for their cameras, but it would also mean cutting them out of potential subscription revenues.  So I can't see that happening. I just hope they can remain solvent for the life of this fixture, because without them, the hardware is pretty much worthless.";"2016-05-05T16:28:28-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951258324&type=Purple%20Software";"951258324";411;"en";"POSITIVE"

They work amazingly well: the fact that they're wired into power means that, although you deal with some extra hassle at installation time, they're tidy and neat and reliably powered after that.  

We had Logitech Alert cameras (and the associated app) before the Kunas, and the Kuna experience is night-and-day better: much more reliable, higher video quality. 

There are a few areas for improvement that keep me from giving this 5 full stars, although it is a product I can recommend.

- First, while it's nice that there are Apple Watch notifications for the Kuna app (whenever motion is detected), it would be great if these contained the image that set off the motion detector. It's frustrating to have to pull out the phone to check whether it's a ""false alarm"" or not.

- Second, the motion detector itself could use some improvement. Sometimes it doesn't seem to notice motion, other times it fires with mere changes in lighting.  (I realize this is tough to get right, and it's nice the vendor provides a mechanism to set the sensitivity of the motion detection.)

- Finally, there's no HomeKit support in the current version of the hardware, and it doesn't seem likely there will be.  I understand that early adopters sometimes get left behind, but that doesn't make it less frustrating.

Still:  if you're looking for hard-wired (power) home security cameras, the Kuna is a great choice.  The app itself is solid, and getting even better with later releases.  We are very happy with our purchase, and can recommend these products.  With a few improvements (to Apple Watch support and motion detection)--this would easily be a 5-star product.";"2017-05-18T18:51:03-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951258324&type=Purple%20Software";"951258324";291;"en";"POSITIVE"

Not soon after installation, I bought the $60 membership. That way my videos would be saved for 30 days.  Not so!  My videos were only saved for seven days, as though I had not purchased a premium membership, let alone a membership at all! Upon calling support, it was a joke.  It was only one guy manning the phones who happened to be filling in for his friend. He tried very hard to solve the problem but as he was not a Kuna technical supporter, he would have to contact Kuna and call me back with possible fixes. He called me back a couple of times but the problem was never solved. 

This was so unfortunate to me because there was a video which I desperately needed to review and send to law-enforcement. This was within 10 days of the event. Sadly enough, the video was long gone as it was outside the seven days that Kuna by default saves your videos.

I had previously told law-enforcement that in regard to this incident, I had full video and audio of everything that happened in regard to the robbery at my house.  Imagine my surprise when the video was unavailable to me from both cameras that covered the entire front of my home.

I have not heard a word from Kuna and my videos are still being saved for only seven days.  If seven days of history is all you need, then this app is for you. But if you pay for something and you get nothing, especially when you thought you had gotten something, it is very unnerving.

I live alone and depend upon the cameras to keep me safe. Had I known it was only a seven day hold, I would have extracted the videos and saved them to my hard drive.  The incident happened on the morning of April 8, 2017. And when I was going to make copies of the videos for the police department 10 days later, they were not there. I knew that I had until May 8, 2017 to review the videos and submit them.   I am so disheartened and severely affected by this situation.

The app on-launch often takes several seconds to load the camera views. Glitchy and pixelated video is common. When a camera is triggered by an event, that camera will often not open, defeating the purpose most likely due to the event being record. The ""AI"" detection is often confused by tree shadows moved by the wind, leading to useless alerts and video clips. There's always lag when speaking with someone; once you are done speaking the visitor cannot be heard because the mic takes a few seconds to open so the beginning of what is said is missed. 

This is not a Wi-Fi issue; my home is saturated with two access-points, both close to the cameras' locations. No issue with bandwidth either; 300/50 Mb.

The facts of my relationship with Kuna/Maximus:  I purchased quantity (5) Kuna smart security lights in March 2017 (see Amazon receipt attached .  October 2017, one of the lights failed and was replaced under warranty.  March 2020 a second light failure, and after refusing the “buy another” resolution proposed by Kuna customer support I was offered me a discounted refurbished unit which I purchased.  April 2020 my third light failure, and the ""buy another"" resolution was offered and adhered to.

Totals:

5 original units
+1 warranty replacement
+1 discounted replacement
7 total units
3 failures

3 failures out of 7 total lights = 42.8% failure rate.

Before you start with possible theories to make yourselves feel better, the lights were installed by a licensed electrician and were caulked with outdoor silicone between the structure and the light by him to further shed water.  I have a receipt and believe the lights were installed in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.

After a brief failure analysis (I’m an engineer) I’ve discovered the following:

Housing:

The water shedding design of the Kuna smart security light housing is weak.  The speaker grille is NOT//NOT covered on the interior with a membrane, although the speaker does have a polymer grommet between the housing cover and the speaker.  The camera gimbal mount does NOT//NOT have gasketing or water prevention sealing.  The mounting post channels also do NOT//NOT have gasketing or sealing incorporated into the design.  These unsealed and unprotected openings will allow moisture to contact the electronics.

Electronics:

I was surprised, but then not surprised to find that NONE of the electronics or connectors were potted.  All that is between the electronics and the environment is the thin plastic housing, which is probably an ABS thermoplastic to improve injection molding efficiency at manufacturing.

Opinion:  While it is impossible for me to know the true motivations for Kuna/Maximus, I believe these lights are not intended to last and are designed to last just a little bit longer than the manufacturers warranty.  I’ve designed and installed outdoor electronics systems, and none with a 43% failure rate after 3 years.  Kuna is quick to offer a “buy another” solution instead of offering a product that is designed to last.  I will be purchasing no more products from Kuna/Maximus.";"2020-05-02T06:20:57-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951258324&type=Purple%20Software";"951258324";424;"en";"NEUTRAL"

The sticky point? It’s the part of having a camera that we each really need, the ability to look back without feeling we have to live on our app.

Look, I don’t jump on my app with every detection. I’m ok with a spider, bird, dog, or mailman that stops by. I’d go wonkers looking all day. I want the “luxury” of checking out what happened during the day in one sitting. 

Oops, it didn’t say it in the box that your footage can be removed within about 4 hours without a subscription. Fear not concerned home owner, you can monitor your app throughout the day and easily download events. OR you can buy a subscription! Wait for it...

The $7.49 per month-to-month ($90 per year) to look back gives you only 7 days. $4.99 per month ($60 per year) if you pay the annual subscription. And that’s for one camera. 

Really? Really?

Now if I bought 4 cameras (nice up-sale) the Kuna “steal the deal” price is $14.99 monthly or $9.99 on an annual subscription. Didn’t say that on the box. Do the math

Fear not, you can downgrade at anytime. How does that work when I pay a year in advance?

Bottom line, I love the camera, but the subscription is too much for too little.

Suggestion: make money with ads on your app with the free subscription and 7 days of storage. Paying $4.99 per month gives me a month with ads. $9.99 per month for your 4 cameras, no ads.

They can’t blame bad WiFi on this either because I have 400 mbps and a excellent bandwidth where my Kuna is installed. Hope they can fix these problems. Update 9/25/18, Now after another so called update to fix the iPhone XS, the live feed is absolutely horrible on Android and iOS and unusable. I will update if it is ever fixed.

UPDATE 9/27/18, it seems like they fixed the problems and the app is now working great, the live stream is great again, thank you.";"2018-09-27T10:23:38-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951258324&type=Purple%20Software";"951258324";141;"en";"POSITIVE"

Good camera quality and audio is above average. Great for security because people can’t tell it is a camera. Once I needed to reset the WiFi it all went wrong. After only a week the WiFi will not attempt to connect and the led lights stopped working. Customer service has been horrible. Language barriers prevented good customer service via phone and the hours are horrible. The email customer service has been just as bad. They only answer after every three days and now wants to question my very strong WiFi network as the problem when the led lights won’t even work to show it is attempting to connect. I will be returning the device for something else on Amazon. I understand defective products happen but customer service response has been horrible.";"2018-07-29T08:09:39-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951258324&type=Purple%20Software";"951258324";134;"en";"NEGATIVE"

About 90% of the time, live feed is mostly green screen and highly distorted. It also takes a long time for live feed to refresh, only to see a green screen most of the time. I've tried switching internet channels, rebooting and I even bought a high speed router, but nothing works. I am getting between 30-100 Mbps outside at the lights and still poor live feed. Without good live feed this system is useless to me. What does not make sense is that recording works fine. The lights also periodically go offline requiring a reboot. The lights look nice and easy to install, but I am ready to take them down and return them.";"2017-10-27T14:00:16-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951258324&type=Purple%20Software";"951258324";122;"en";"NEGATIVE"

We've been really happy with our Kuna Light and the motion detection works well and doesn't have too many false alarms. In terms of the app, I've used both the Android and iOS versions of the app and the Android version is less buggy and more reliable when it comes to notifications and playback. The iOS app needs some work as it frequently has weird issues like notifications not appearing (or disappearing right after they are received) and I have playback issues a lot of the time. If I try to stream the recorded videos from the app itself they often just spin and never load. If I download them, the download is fast and the videos plays fine outside of the app. Overall, the app is good and has a nice interface but I'd really like to see it reach the same level of reliability as the Android counterpart.";"2017-03-20T09:51:34-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951258324&type=Purple%20Software";"951258324";158;"en";"POSITIVE"

I can see my Kuna devices but the configurations do not work. 

Light setting is not recognized- not mater how you set it, it goes dusk-till-dawn. 

Motion detection is stuck at 50%. In the app you can change to 100% or 10% and you get the same result. 

Customer service does not respond to any requests.  Just check Amazon Reviews. 

When they work - they're great. But the problem is they usually do not work.";"2017-01-28T13:08:08-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951258324&type=Purple%20Software";"951258324";80;"en";"POSITIVE"
