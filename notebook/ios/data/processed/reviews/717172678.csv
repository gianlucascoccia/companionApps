I really enjoy seeing the heart rate graphs for each workout and how they compare to previous workouts.  Polar Flow also shows you a graph of how much “strain” you can take based off your last seven days and your average strain over the last month.  With Polar Flow I can easily see if I have been consistent or falling off in intensity and duration.  It’s detailed enough that I can nerd out, or just feel guilty for too many “recovery” days.  I do a wide variety of workouts as well but the Polar program really shines when it comes to running.  Great in app maps, pace counts, and detailed analysis on the supporting website.  Very accurate prediction for future running performance. The Vantage M paired with Polar Flow has been a worthy investment that I have enjoyed for several years.";"2021-10-24T07:06:37-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=717172678&type=Purple%20Software";"717172678";158;"en";"POSITIVE"

My vantage m and the polar app have some great features. I like seeing my progress and the ability to gauge overreaching mixed with poor sleep. I enjoy the sport profiles and being able to set heart rate monitored activities and non heart rate activities. But over the last two years I have a small wish list. 1) I have to restart the polar app every time i want to sync with my watch. 2)There is no find your phone option.  3) Cant charge the watch in the middle of an activity. This is nice for long days bike-packing. Garmin allows overnight charging without stopping the activity. This way the entire route is one post.  4) I am in the medical field and frequently need to count respirations or heart rate using a second hand. The second hand on my polar only displays for about six seconds when i raise my wrist so its not helpful. 5) Zwift: Polar does not link with zwift so I cant see my heart rate data from my watch on the zwift platform. This is a dilemma when I want to track strain and progress with polar. I have to start my watch as well as wear a heart rate strap compatible with zwift. I then have to delete the strava activity (i use both fitness platforms to track progress) Compatibility with other apps and platforms would be great!
I have really enjoyed the watch however couple things that I would like to improve. Thanks Polar!";"2021-10-16T18:35:41-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=717172678&type=Purple%20Software";"717172678";258;"en";"POSITIVE"

- The delay in displaying heart rate. Because of this delay it is easy to overshoot my maximum heart rate while exercising. I have verified this delay by comparing the M’s reading to that of various pieces of exercise equipment. However, when hiking, or doing other activities, without another piece of equipment to track the actual heart rate it is easy to overrun, or underachieve. 
- Like many people over the age of 60, I have to get up during the night to relieve myself. Unfortunately the Polar Vantage M and or the Polar app think that I rwmain awake from that point forward, even though I do go back to sleep. Again, I see a very substantial difference between what Polar believes is my sleep time and that shown by my CPAP machine...

With that said when i run on the treadmill the data collected is extremely questionable. It has never given me an accurate distance. Today’s run it captured 3.5miles of 5. Unfortunately the flow app doesn’t allow me to calibrate for my stride/Light footstrike and correct the inaccurate distance. This means you’re left with a completely worthless run data history. Worse is the questions it raises about the other data captured. If it missed 1.5miles making it completely off on your pace, how accurate is the cadence data. Also best of luck if you forget to stop your workout because there is no way to correct the inaccurate data. I find myself depending on a lot of other apps just like when i had my polar FT1.

2. Elevation isn’t shown on the workout in the app, I have to go to the full website to see it.
3. The HR monitor strap isn’t the best - it misses measurements; I actually need to test it with the phone as well as the watch to try and isolate the issue. 

I’ve mostly worn the watch as a daily tracker and used it with HR monitor for running, bike rides, hiking, etc. and overall, it’s pretty good, no major issues.

The Phased Target is a good construct but usually each phase is a lap but Flow doesn’t seem to tag them that way. When I import data into Strava or even the flow app, still don’t know straight away my average speed in each of the phases (FYI the automatic lap is turned off )

The corresponding issue on the watch is that there is no way to know what avg speed I’m going at in each phase cos the phases aren’t treated as laps. 

For example I need to be able to create the phased target (see below), start the run, should never need to touch the watch until the work out ends and be able to see avg pace + avg HR in each phase and this contextual information needs to be tagged and saved so I can import and see it.

Example : 
10m warmup
4 X 1k @ 3:40 with 60 sec rest
5 min easy jog
4 x 1k @ 3:40 with 60 sec rest
10 min cool down

I recently switched from Garmin and super disappointed I can’t do this over in polar. I hope this gets addressed soon.

That, to me, should be here too.

If it’s there… and I just don’t see it, then that’s why I am willing to concede a d give a fourth star…

You know, because it could be that I’m just an idiot who could afford a watch to monitor my heart, but only minute by minute.

Maybe I don’t understand the basic concept of Polar Flow and Polar Unite. But what I was hoping for are some exercise routines in the strength and supportive categories. 

I happened on a screen that said other outdoor and while cycling, it measured the time and “steps” (which didn’t make sense) and some other parameters. But I don’t think it reported distance although in GPS.
