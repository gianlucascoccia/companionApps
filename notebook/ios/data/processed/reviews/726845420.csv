That being said, idk if it was the update but all of a sudden it’s making me plug my phone back into the camera base in order to use it. It’s only just started doing this in the last month or so, which makes me think it’s just an update issue (and I’ve had it for like 2 yrs). BUT! Ultimately worth the buy!  
Update-July 2018- we’ve had another iBabyCare update, still needing to plug my phone into the camera base multiple times a week. Getting a little annoying because, of course, it doesn’t show that it’s having an issue until the baby is asleep in the room and you have to try and be as quiet as possible so you don’t wake them... and I really liked the iBabyCare.";"2018-07-03T22:23:25-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=726845420&type=Purple%20Software";"726845420";153;"en";"POSITIVE"

The camera seems just fine, but the app has always been the pain point. It routinely gets killed by the iOS watchdog for freezing. It is sometimes hard to tell whether our child hasn’t moved in a while or if the app has frozen—until that 15-second window closes and the app gets killed by the OS. This simply is not good enough for quick checks on a child.

The UX itself has received no obvious improvements in the time we have used it. The presentation of the air quality data reported by the camera is a source of serious annoyance and disappointment. The graph is baffling to the point that it is meaningless to me. If anything, this app makes me regret spending extra to get the camera model with the extra sensors. I guess the marketing department at iBaby Labs is skilled at glossing over the shortcomings of the software—you know, the part of the product that is ostensibly flexible and open to continuous improvement.

It saddens me that the software component of this otherwise solid product has been left to languish. Frankly, I was shocked that the company updated the app for the iPhone X (released November 2017). In my memory, that is the only real change that has been made, and that was simply to keep the app from being letterboxed in compatibility mode.";"2019-10-20T07:12:49-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=726845420&type=Purple%20Software";"726845420";241;"en";"NEGATIVE"

The reviews I had read were wrong and we truly loved this monitor, then September 2019 rolls around and everything changes. The app starts crashing, when it did work it took forever for the app to send directions to the camera, and if I would try to play music it would crash instantly, and for my daughter that was a huge deal because she had gone the past 6 months listening to the music from her monitor to sleep. It is now December of 2019, I have yet to hear from customer service and I have gone 4 months without a monitor because we can’t afford to get one. The app glitches, even with being reconnected 5 minutes prior (reconnecting it is the same as the initial set up so you have to be right by the monitor to do so, not ideal when you have a sleeping child that you’re trying to not wake up), then even when I finally get the monitor to work it never last longer than a hour.

There isn’t much consistency and the sound bar is obnoxious to adjust on my phone. In order to keep white noise or music playing, I leave the sound off and set alerts. Half the time the alerts don’t work either. We both fully tested the alerts before we went to bed, and then woke up to our baby crying. No alerts came through.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: Sound turns off now after 2-3 minutes when app isn't actively in the foreground, which is completely ridiculous for a baby camera that most people leave on all night specifically for sound. Been having issues connecting when not on wifi the last several updates despite specs that boast otherwise, even though it was working before. The horrible updates on this app make me want to turn off automatic app updates until the development team gets their testing together, or just find a better supported product. I'm a developer myself and making the app more buggy or at minimum less user friendly each update is unacceptable.

You’ll have the app running in the background, and then when you go to open it again, it freezes and then crashes. Don’t expect to check on your baby quickly, as every time you open the app you’ll have to wait for it to shut down and then restart. We also have occasional issues where the screen just goes black with a spinning wheel, and we have to sneak into our baby’s nursery (while trying not to wake the baby) and reconnect the monitor (just as you did with initial set up).

Contacting customer service is a complete waste of time. They will just cut and paste a canned response (usually unrelated to your issue), and provide no personal response at all. I wrote to them about the app crashing, and they responded with WiFi tips (our WiFi is very strong and works consistently, and the router is right near the cam, so no issue there at all). I’ve tried calling them as well, and never actually spoken to a person.

We have had it for a year and I honestly believe that the professional reviews we went by were for a completely different product.   The short list of complaints:

* the only device on our mesh wifi network that has constant connectivity issues. We have 5 other full HD cameras; all of them work fine. 

* the iPhone app is the worst battery hog ever.  Even with the screen turned off, only using the app for audio monitoring - I  have never seen any app drain a fully charged phone so quickly. 

* the mini usb power connector is not aligned properly. One cannot simply has connect the power cord. It must be inserted at a very awkward angle or the plug just does not go in. 

* the environmental monitors are not accurate. Especially the thermal metrics which I checked against other controls.   I’m not sure about humidity or c02 but I suspect that they may be inaccurate too. 

* today was the last straw. The M7 suddenly won’t play any music or sound effects. Resetting the app on two different iPhones, nor a full hardware reset did any good.  In fact, now we are without any baby monitor because the factory reset seems to have hosed the device. Despite following all instructions and trying at least 10 times, the setup hangs between steps 1&2. 

I have never posted a review but I am so aggravated with this over priced garbage that I felt the need to warn others.";"2020-03-14T15:23:39-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=726845420&type=Purple%20Software";"726845420";257;"en";"NEGATIVE"

Occasionally it freezes or needs to be force closed. My main issue is that it doesn’t seem to properly put itself into the background. If I use the app and activate listen mode, the app appears to drain battery even if I turn off listening. In the past 24 hours it’s been running in the background for 21 hours, using 25% of my battery usage, even though I haven’t had audio on in the background at all. It’s nice to be able to have the audio in the background but there’s no real reason to have so much background activity. My only guess is that it continues to listen to continues to run to provide notifications about temperature or air quality — but in my opinion that should be handled by the monitors in the cloud with push notifications.";"2020-04-29T18:32:22-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=726845420&type=Purple%20Software";"726845420";148;"en";"POSITIVE"

That said, the biggest issues are in its cheap design.   After over 3 years, this app only supports the basics.  It hasn’t been updated and is being outpaced by other devices and respective apps.  I would recommend people look beyond iBaby for a monitor.  They clearly are not interested in keeping up.

So what needs to be done?   First, the app only supports running in portrait mode.  You can tilt, and the video switches, but the app itself is still in portrait mode.  This isn’t as much an issue on the iPhone as it is the iPad.   The iPad is mainly used in Landscape mode and you can’t use other apps with it.  It does NOT support split screen, PIP video (when minimized) and other features of the iPad.  Coming from an iOS developer, these are easy to implement.  It just appears that the company has no interest in customer retention or growth.  

Again, I recommend looking at other baby monitors that have adapted.  It is unfortunate, as the device seems like it is very good.

The temperature and humidity settings are nice to see, so I know she’s comfortable. I’m impressed that the air quality monitor can actually pick up when we leave a messy diaper in the trash on the opposite side of the room! It tells us we have fair or bad air quality. Oops. 

Two things are annoying. I’ve seen others complain about the refresh. As in, they say the monitor shows the baby still sleeping when she’s not even there. I have noticed a lag at times, which is likely our WiFi speed and not the app. The solution I’ve found is to close out the app when I’m done so that it has to refresh the next time it opens. This avoids seeing images that are from the previous time. 

Second annoyance is that the sound and motion alerts pop up in the middle of my screen when I’m in the app watching. That seems dumb.

You can’t have more than two users really, and not more than one owner.  This limits it’s advertised functionality of having more users, but hey, whatever I guess.

The biggest downside is that there is a light on the back of the system that goes off when the wifi is off, or for random reasons. This lights up a dark room and kinda wakes my baby up, even though it is a small light.

Still well worth the cost and all, I do love this app now.  

Volume control could use improvement, and the image capture and image in general is funny in that it zooms the entire UI and not just the image, so everything gets grainy.

And really...a company that abandons its legacy products so soon after it was the flagship probably isn’t spending very much to keep hackers out of your network.

I don’t trust this brand with good reason. REAL baby monitors don’t have the headaches followed product abandonment that this iBaby mess has.";"2017-10-29T11:10:21-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=726845420&type=Purple%20Software";"726845420";150;"en";"NEGATIVE"

Serious issue: The big problem I encountered was that the initial M6S device setup was not working. I have iOS 12. It would all for the wireless key and then spin forever. I got it to setup with an older phone with iOS 10, where it asked if I wanted to share the wifi key. Subsequently the app worked ok on iOS 12.

Annoyances: 
1) when opening the app Why is the sound turned off by default? This is a baby monitor! The default should be on.
2)it is clear when comparing to a dedicated FHSS monitor that the sound lags behind by almost a second. This gives a weird wailing echo effect when baby is crying. I have a fast Network and so the device or the software are to blame. 

Feature: What I'd really like to see a red indicator at the top left of the iPhone (an oval background to the time/carrier display) when in lock mode; this is a shortcut to open the app and serves as an indicator that the monitor is running in audio mode. This is implemented in the ""cloud baby monitor"" app and is very useful as a shortcut.";"2018-10-11T12:43:39-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=726845420&type=Purple%20Software";"726845420";213;"en";"POSITIVE"

Contacting your support is the moral equivalent of dealing with a phone tree as they won't talk to me unless I provide them the info in triplicate or they just ignore you and you never hear from them again.  Meanwhile their forum and other sites have all mentioned these same issues, without any reply from the developer about the ongoing issues.

Just split the development and put the older version up for older iOS users to use and continue to develop the newer apps for the newer iOS versions.

Great video quality, in daylight and night with the built in IR camera. Camera is easily controlled by the app and very responsive.

Cons:
The App crashes A LOT!! Given that this is the only way to watch the video. It’s a big big problem. Camera also frequently sends out false alarms, no matter how much I reduce the sensitivity. We’re talking every 10min at times. It was so bad that I just turned off the alarms altogether.

[Updated]";"I am revising my rating to 4 stars due to the quick response front iBaby support but still knocking a star off as the procedure of getting the application working again was very frustrating. It took multiple attempts to restore the connection which was working just fine before the firmware update. This is something that I feel should not have happened from installing one of their updates. But for now I am back up and running. Hopefully this problem will not rear its ugly head again. 

Original review:
I installed the firmware update when the popup appeared within the app. I am now unable to view the video feed on any device. A reset and reconnect also failed to restore the video. I then deleted and re-installed the app. After this I was still unable to view the video feed. I now have a worthless piece of hardware. The manufacturer better fix this quick as we rely on the baby monitor to monitor the sleeping child while dealing with the one who is awake. Extremely disappointed with what happened today and I will be forced to seek remedy soon if this is not quickly corrected.";"2016-01-20T11:54:21-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=726845420&type=Purple%20Software";"726845420";195;"en";"NEGATIVE"

PROS:
-Night mode makes eyes look like raccoons so you can tell if your child is asleep or awake by their glowing pupils
-Viewing in landscape or portrait mode 
-Sharing feed with family (create separate logins and limit controls)
-Take photos/video
CONS:
-Constant white noise when listening
-Eats battery like crazy. Make sure your phone is plugged in at night or it will die at some point in the evening
-No SmartTV APP or PC streaming. It would have been helpful to view the feed via a website or SmartTV to have a larger screen and not be worried about phone power or connection
-Feed always freezes. If you open another app with this in the background, or while the phone goes into sleep mode, the image will be frozen, sometimes despite closing and reopening app
-Resolution is very poor most of the time
-360 viewing can be difficult to angle because of the base. You may have a hard time seeing your child if he/she moves in the crib despite the ability to pivot the camera in different angles. When pointing down, it can get cut off/blocked easily by the base or other objects in the way. The camera will likely have to be mounted high up on the wall, which is also an issue with the poor res, not to mention wires that will run along the wall
-Monitor lights might be distracting for your child. It took my daughter a while to not be lured/kept up by the monitor’s red night-mode lights 
-If you are recording with the app in the background, or while your phone is sleeping, your video will likely be lost. The app will usually freeze at some point. The video doesn’t save to your phone as it streams. You must hit the stop button in order for it to save. If you don’t, the video is gone.
-Long videos get cut off. It will display full time but the footage will stop after a few minutes.
-Sensitive sound pickup. This can be a pro or con I suppose, but be mindful of where you place it, especially if you’re sharing this feed with the grandparents. This easily pickups voices and sounds in another room or floor of your house.";"2019-07-27T05:48:36-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=726845420&type=Purple%20Software";"726845420";379;"en";"POSITIVE"

This isn’t a very complicated process, and it is a very important need for parents. These cameras are meant, first and foremost, to serve as a monitoring tool for a parent to watch over a small child. Simply put, any parent who relies on iBaby is compromising the ability to monitor the child’s safety and well-being. I am done with iBaby! A new glitch in the camera now causes the audio feed to turn off completely while the audio connection/icon remains highlighted. So, within minutes of turning on the camera and audio connection, the audio feed cuts out completely while the app gives absolutely no indication that something isn’t working. I have had the same camera for over a year, and for the most part everything has worked as expected in that first year. But these last few months have seen nothing but unreliable problems. I do not want to put my child in a position where we cannot hear him for hours and hours at a time. What if he is sick, what if he has a nightmare, what if climbs out of the crib!? There are a number of things that a parent simply NEEDS to know are happening ... and iBaby is not the type of partner that values those needs. Good bye. 

UPDATE-All of my previous issues have been addressed and corrected. Thank you for listening to your customer feedback.

While I'm sure everyone has their own features that are most important to them, here are the biggest issues I have with recent iBabyCare updates:

(1)  There is a significant delay in loading the app. Before it was much faster, and if you already had it running and just were switching back on iOS there was hardly any delay. After the recent updates, there seems to be some substantial reloading or relogging in process. 

(2)  There quality control process for the programmers of this app now seems to be LIVE updates with trial & error. This app is very important and personal to a lot of parents. We do not want to hope that the app is working. We do not want to wait until big fixes are pushed out before making sure that our children are alright. 

I used to speak very highly of this app, and regularly recommended it to family and friends. That is absolutely no longer the case. I would feel completely embarrassed to pass along the iBabyCare name only to have a new parent come back to me questioning what I suggested to rely on for monitoring their baby. 

No thanks!!!

So far no issues, easy install , and has everything I needed in a baby monitor! Love the ability to see/ hear remotely (was really important feature I needed). Further amazing that you can invite people to see the same images you see live. Amazing ! 5 stars thus far! However the decrease in stars is that you don't have that much control to the access of individuals you invite. Great for grandparents to have access ... however they can hear and see live images at all times once you invite . There is no option to turn off/ on access temporarily. I doubt anyone wants baby's grandparents hearing/ seeing ANYTIME they want... as owner/ parent of baby you would want more control (example turn of hearing access). Further you can delete user but they still can see / hear everything (you might think, ""ok I deleted I can say anything / do anything ... NOOOO!!!) . If they don't close the app, they may NEVER close it, then they STILL have access to everything. They must close app after you've deleted them in order for them not to have access anymore . Good concept overall and a 5 star option but glitches in the areas I mentioned that are really scary to think you've deleted someone access yet BIG possibility they are still seeing/ hearing everything .

That said, it is terrible with app switching (freezes and crashes), it has no mechanism for letting you know that the “video” of your sleeping child is actually a still frame and 15 minutes old because the feed is down, and if you want to use bluetooth headphones at all while the app is open you can forget it. Another baby cam I have has a crappy app, but at least allows me to listen to my phone with bluetooth headphones while monitoring my kid. It would also be nice to have an auto-mute feature that allows you to not have to hear the white noise of your kids empty room constantly throughout nap time or the whole night. The biggest issue is, however, that you can sometimes go a while with no indication that the app and or video feed froze.  The other day the app was frozen for nearly 15 minutes on a still image of what appeared to be a sleeping baby. If she hadn’t been in a rocker that I could tell wasn’t moving it would have been easy to think that everything was still fine even if it wasn’t. I don’t expect this type of tech to be flawless, but I should be notified when a problem is occurring so that it can be addressed, or I can at least choose to ignore it.";"2016-01-31T15:39:48-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=726845420&type=Purple%20Software";"726845420";243;"en";"POSITIVE"

Love you can speak through the monitor, play music, take photos/videos. Both of our moms will peek in on the baby from their homes, and I love being able to check in on our baby during date night or when I am traveling. Like all software, there are a few issues we ran into: We love having both a night vision option or regular camera setting. It will automatically switch between the two based on the light in the room. We ended up defaulting to night vision all the time because it would occasionally ""click"" back and forth between the two in the middle of the day and make a noise. Also, one of the updated releases there was a audio ""bug"" where it would cut in and out on sound. I called the customer service line and they immediately explained the issue, let me know when it would be fixed and in the meantime provided me a new link to download a temporary app where the audio didn't cut in and out.

1. App is easy to use. Setup wasn't quite as easy due to my wifi setup and the extra security I have set up. The upside was one call to the company and it was resolved. 
2. Very nice that while at home on the same network, you can exit the app and still listen in for any sound or movement. I feared it would not allow me to go to other apps and use my phone as necessary and still be able to listen in.
3. Camera function with pan works well along with night time quality more than sufficient. My only complaint if you can call it that with the auto function of night vision is that it seems to take a lot of light to shut it off. The camera tends to stay on night viewing most of the time. 
4. Doesn't seem to drain my battery like I thought it would. 

Some things to work on
1. When I have the app open and listening, it tends to lose audio when after I take a call. I have to quit the app and restart to get audio. This is very annoying

How to make the overall product better?
1. iPad app
2. Mac OS X app so when I'm at my desk I can always have it up. I work from home while caring for my baby during the day.
3. Fix the audio issue where audio stops working after you take a call.

Camera is the most unreliable and untrustworthy piece of technology, I can't understand how IBabyCare still stays in business. We have IBabyCare since September 2016 and it's horrible, it would quit in the middle of the night and wouldn't restart, so in case if your baby wakes up with the fever and tears you will not be aware until your baby will be screaming for you loud enough that you don't even need the baby monitor to know that. Temperature and humidity work only once in a while, sometimes sound just wouldn't work at all, or sometimes app just wouldn't connect for 4-5 days, costumer service takes time to up to a week to respond you instead of promised 24 hours and does not help you to solve the issue. Yes our monitor located close to the router and we have great wifi and latest updates, the iBabyCare system is just unreliable you will never know when app will crash in a middle of the night, oh and plus it's drains your phone battery!

If you choose to deny push notifications it asks you every, single, time you open the app. Every time. It's really frikking annoying. Hey ibaby, I DON'T WANT PUSH NOTIFICATIONS! So if you don't want this annoying pop up you have to agree to push notifications. It brings up the next pop up telling you to go to settings and enable push notifications. I have tried every combination of going through these pop ups to disable them. I have also uninstalled and reinstalled the app more times than I can count. Even reinstalled the app after a fresh iPhone restore. The only way to stop the pop ups is to agree to push notifications, enable push notifications, and then disable all of the banners, badges, sounds etc. If I say I don't want push notifications, it's because I don't need them.

We NEED to be able to monitor our child. That is why we purchased one of the nicest monitors out there. It has literally become a risk. So now guess what...we are looking for a different monitor. Congratulations ibaby. You are losing a customer who purchased a $200 product OVER AN APP. You are not listening to your customers reviews. I never ever ever post reviews this bad. But this is too crucial. The safety of my child is now at risk because your monitor doesn't allow me to monitor my child.";"2016-08-13T01:55:16-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=726845420&type=Purple%20Software";"726845420";235;"en";"NEGATIVE"

Lights on the monitor can be distracting to baby esp in a blacked out room. Monitor also a little noisey when panning. But overall works great if these issues don't upset your baby. We're using the iBaby app on our iPhone 6+'s with an M6 Monitor purchased in Feb 2015.  Setup is a breeze although the app would often freeze when both phones we're being used (easy fix: both users should use the same iBaby account rather than each user's individual acct). We added a 2nd monitor a few months later but this also caused random freeze ups.  A quick call to iBaby's customer service dept, along with a subsequent email from them with step by step instructions on how to reset the monitor, and both of our apps & monitors have been working great ever since. We've been using it every day for the past 10 mos & love it.";"2015-11-15T13:08:59-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=726845420&type=Purple%20Software";"726845420";166;"en";"POSITIVE"

The app has portion of notification and alert tone (alarm) when it detects motion/sound. The notification works fine all the time. However, the alert tone only plays sometimes. I have ensured that the phone is not in silent mode and volume/ringers are at increased level. With the lack of a separate device for viewing/ controlling the baby monitor (like many other brands provide), I feel this is a huge flaw in the software or the device. The whole purpose of the monitor is to get alert when baby is moving or crying and iBaby monitor/ software isn't doing that consistently!
There are other secondary issues in the app too. Sometimes the settings just keeps on loading and I have have to restart the app to get it working again.

I am surprised how people could design such poor product or app when it comes to baby safety. I recommend everyone to stay out of this product. I just opened ticket with the support team but I am honestly thinking of returning this product after reading other reviews that have issues like mine.";"2017-04-02T08:03:13-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=726845420&type=Purple%20Software";"726845420";195;"en";"POSITIVE"

I love the features (being able to listen, speak, record, take pictures, view remotely, play music, have multiple ppl ""in control"" if desired, all from your phone, etc). Installation was super easy. As with most baby monitors, it was hard to find a spot that can view the entire crib. We ended up taking down one side of the crib bumpers for that reason. I don't like that it makes a camera shutter sound every time it switches from daytime vision to night vision. It kills your battery (as expected though for what it does). You definitely have to have your phone charging if using for a prolonged time. Our picture quality is excellent. We bought a second one for the family room.

Sometimes my screen freezing when I am trying to pan the camera around the room to see if someone is in there, but that seems to be the only problem I've had with it so far.

If you're not actively watching your device screen to make sure the feed is still up, you will have no idea that your baby has been crying for the last 20 minutes straight.  This is an ENORMOUS and very fixable problem that I cannot believe the company has ignored.  It's worsened after each firmware update as the app loses connection every six minutes or so, and now (Feb. 2017) it seems as though shifting the app to the background makes it cut the feed entirely.  Reopening causes a refresh. 

I spoke with iBaby support and was promised that fixes were in the works - as of November 2015.  It's been over a year and the problems have only worsened, and support still says variations on 'in the works.'

Original review: I can say having the monitor be an app on our phones and iPad is WAY better than having a separate monitor device. We can check the monitor from both our phones whenever and wherever we have our phone with us. I can check from work, or even in the car on my way home to see if I should tell my wife to put the dog in the garage before I pull up do he doesn't wake the baby. Love that you can move the monitor camera from your phone with a simple swipe. This device has been a godsend.

The actual hardware (camera) is great, however the software (app) is not at all:

1. Alert settings continuously change and do not work as expected. The on/off toggles change from one moment to another (ie, motion alert, sound alert, alert tone, notifications). This solution is supposed to give you piece of mind and the app is failing me. 

2. The app has some noticeable lags in it that you can observe in alert settings and the video itself. My wifi connection is perfectly fine by the way.

3. There is no native iPad app and it is a bit deceiving to advertise and claim that it is compatible with an iPad. This is false. Sure, you can download the iPhone app into the iPad, but you can do this for any other iPhone app. Either create a native iPad app or do not claim that it is compatible with an iPad, disappointing.

The camera and app combo is promising, but the app needs to be corrected.
