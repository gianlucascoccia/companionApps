I’ve been on with tech support multiple times to get temperature sensors to connect. Turns out I had beta hardware. They did send me a new temperature sensor and it connects now. However they never did get my keen hub to update firmware. They said it’s my ISP.  Of course ISP says it keen. Never got anywhere with that. In the app trying to set the temperature for the vent to close or open it just resets to original value. I had to do it prob 9 or 12 time to get it to stick. One vent I had to reset to get the app to set the close temp.  Constant issues. Going to try SmartThings hub next and see if it works better. When it all works it’s great and does exactly what is advertised. The problem is it rarely works for long. Have to mess with it 2 to 3 times per week.

Previous review:

Great Idea, but Half Baked

These vents are a great idea, and it's clear that some time has been spent on the hardware. Unfortunately, the iOS app and corresponding software seems to be half baked. The interface leaves a lot of interpretation to the user - does +1 degree in a room mean that it's a degree hotter than it should be, or that you want it a degree hotter? You can schedule 'occupancy' times for rooms, but the settings are too coarse - and the weekend settings would probably make more sense if they allowed you to set up late nights on Friday and Saturday. Instead it's Saturday and Sunday, which are indeed the weekend days but not necessarily the right days for this application.

Also the app's 'Auto' mode, which should really be its top feature, hasn't worked for about a month. Tech support from Keen stopped responding to messages - but they seem more than happy to post updates about their attempts to recruit investors for the company.

Stay away until there are signs of life from the development team and improvements to the software!";"2020-04-03T16:34:06-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1052372493&type=Purple%20Software";"1052372493";219;"en";"POSITIVE"

I purchased it since I’d be working from home and need a better way to assist airflow as opposed to a yard stick. The yard stock is better. This thing is a joke. It works great for a few days then it disconnects. It works great for a few days and it starts becoming possessed by opening and closing non stop. It works great for a few days and then you have to delete the room and reset everything and repair. I’ve tried manual mode without the auto temp, it does what it wants to. I tell it to open, it closes. I put it to 50% it goes to 45 or 58. I manually close it and have it set to closed and it will open back up. 

Kenn support is a joke. Contact them through their chat and it’s days later off at all you hear back. Same goes with email contact. 

I’m really tired of theirs and this devices nonsense. They’ve advised one time it is my ISP causing a connection issue. I tried my MiFi I use for when I travel and it still has the same issues. I’ve reset these devices I don’t know how many times. I’m about to go back to the yard stick and manual vent.

The door of the handler closet was blowing open because the force of he air split open the plenum. I sent an email with the problem on Tuesday and received a reply which was no help. The system is no longer automated opening and closing vents to balance the temperature throughout the house.

The software has been a bit of a let down. Originally they tried to use an internal temperature sensor to help automatically adjust the vent. This never worked very well and I always wondered how the vent would measure accurate ambient temperature in the room. The sensor placement would be better if it was where the people live. Now the app no longer has this feature. It has a simple schedule for occupancy of the room. I really like how easy this is and wish it was like this from the beginning.

The app is extremely buggy. Try going to the support page. I’ll wait. Then try leaving the support page without closing the app. It can’t be done! 

Back in March I my system had a communication issue. Nobody at Keen would help be troubleshoot it, but for some reason in May they sent me all new vents and bridges and sensors. Sounds great, right? Well, turns out I just needed a single bridge replaced—something they easily could have figured out had they spent a few mins on the phone with me. 

Then the quest to Mail all the crap back to them started. I was assured a return label was going to be emailed “tomorrow” then a week went by. Then another week. Then an assurance that someone would call me. Then a few more weeks. Finally, I was asked to mail it back to them at my own expense and get reimbursed.

By far the most impressing part of Keen is the hardware. The vents are beautiful. Solid aluminum air blades and a well engineered battery pack for easy battery replacement. 

I can understand the poor reviews because there are some bugs in the app but I worked through these bugs with their chat support feature in the app. In about a week of back and forth Keen is running perfect and has been for a few months.

They sent out new battery packs with padding around the batteries, which hasn’t helped.   Now they are plugging external temperature sensors you need to buy.

After a couple of years finding workarounds on every issue, dealing with support, absolutely NO APP UPDATES since who knows when. Worst ecobee integration (if you want to call it that) ever.

Purchase Help: Before I purchased Keen in July 2018, I looked at the other two larger systems. The help I received from Keen before purchase was very good. One of the other systems wanted to charge me for an estimate. Not Keen. Great help in purchasing.

Shipping: The devices arrived just as promised. The SUPPORT button was so easy to click and ask the status of my order. Support is not 24-7 but they ALWAYS got back to me the next day.

Installation: I was offered help with the installation but decided to do it myself. I followed the instructions and everything worked! It was EASY.

So how is it working now 1 year later? Really good!!! I had some issues (not understanding the system) so I contacted Support and they were very responsive. They can see my system and offered help in settings etc. 

My system works perfect with my Ecobee Thermostat and Ecobee room sensors along with the Keen temp sensors. I can now keep my bedroom nice and cool at night while closing vents in my office and other unused rooms when not occupied. The Control feature of each vent allows me to tell the system when I am not in that room and close the vent. NICE!

I would like to see the temp sensor help with the Control of the vents by allowing me to set temps at certain times of the day. Right now it is all occupied or unoccupied. I know Keen will continue to improve. The 1 & 2 star reviews are not valid, in my book. I feel they did not try to contact Keen Support with their problems.

I found the vents fit snug into my vent openings because they are shallow and the keen vent is tall.

I found the software confusing. I linked it with my Ecobee and room sensors and didn’t realize you have to click into the room then select “set temperature limit” then go back out to the home controls to set the optimal temperature for the room. Why not just provide 2 sliders or modes on the home controls screen? Optimal temperature limit and manual override opening/closing vents?

A min/max open threshold is a good idea as well. Not less than 10% but not more than 80% for example.

I also had issues getting the vent and smart bridge to communicate (on a desk next to each other) I had to power cycle the smart bridge several times to get it to connect.

I’ve just got the one vent installed in a room close to the smart bridge but was disappointed that I couldn’t get it to connect in the room down the hallway where I need the vent. It seems silly to have to buy repeaters in this day in age. It’s also confusing when my ecobee room sensors run off a coin battery and I have them throughout the house (far from the ecobee3 lite thermostat) and require no repeaters to work. Maybe this is the difference between Zigbee and z-wave? It feels like a scam to buy more smart bridges as repeaters when we have mesh WiFi and Bluetooth head phones that can connect thru many walls and floors.

If the reason Keen used Zigbee is low power, I’d rather buy a battery charger and recharge the batteries and replace them every 6months so the vents can run off a real wireless protocol like WiFi or Bluetooth vs. buying antiquated hardware repeaters.";"2019-01-03T21:18:07-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1052372493&type=Purple%20Software";"1052372493";328;"en";"POSITIVE"

Now I am in the process of figuring out how to use the vents. No good instruction exist so I am moving my vents from room to register room. 

I asked for help with setup and have not received a response. I am only invested 3 vents and a hub. I have a nest so thought this would be a good choice.

I have invested substantially in making my home more efficient and the cost savings in energy use have more than justified the initial cost for the products I use. From Hue lights, Ecobee Thermostats, integrated alarm systems, sprinklers, motion sensing light switches and bathroom vents, I have installed and worked with dozens of products. Hands down the Keen vents have been the worst products, application and customer service family, bar none. 

In theory the vents are a great idea, balancing your homes temperature in different rooms. But in use I can say I have spent more time, mostly frustrated, with the devices. They either didn’t connect or work properly (which then needed to be exchanged), or an app that is extremely difficult to manipulate without a website portal, or a company and service group that simply read from a manual provided by the headquarters with no real knowledge of the devices or how they integrate with the thermostats. 

DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. You will spend more time (I have for the past three years) trying to get it to work than having a product that is actually working properly. They are also a major energy users and you will replace batteries often. They will constantly lose contact to the hub and repeaters and vents take multiple times connecting and lose connection often. They also do not notify you when the batteries have been depleted putting the onus on you to check every vent, in the app, all the time to find out which is empty, stuck in a closed position or in an open position, negating their effectiveness. 

Again in theory they are a great idea and obviously much cheaper than having your AC guy install dampers throughout your duct work.

1) Constant resets of the battery packs needed to get vents back online. This happens at least once a week for one of my ten. Often even battery replacements. 
2) Needed to buy an extra repeater to get the 10 to work in an open(ish) upstairs area covering about 1500 square feet. 
3) App has two areas that show percentage open and neither are ever the same. What one, if any, is the most accurate is a question I’ve had for two years. 
4) Set one of the aforementioned percentages and come back later and it’s changed to full open of full closed. 
5) Emailed then early on and prior to purchasing to ask about room by room temperature readings and adjustments. Was told that it would be enabled soon via a firmware update. Two years later, it is enabled but via a very expensive add on hardware purchase. (I have cheap room temperature sensors that are connected to my Nest and Home Assistant. I could easily automate this if they had an accessible API.)
6) Was told they do not and have no plans of establishing a public API. In the world of smart homes today this is unacceptable to me. 

You live and you learn/waste money. I count this as just that. If someone will pay the shipping I’ll sell you my 10 plus the two repeaters for a few bucks each!";"2018-08-06T06:05:00-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1052372493&type=Purple%20Software";"1052372493";292;"en";"POSITIVE"

If you are looking for a way for your vents to intelligently open and close themselves based on room temperature without you having to lift a finger or otherwise babysit the technology, look elsewhere.

I have 9 Keen Home vents in my house, as well as an ecobee thermostat with a temperature sensor in every room - it’s the ideal setup, really.  I’ve granted the KeenHome system access to my ecobee thermostat to poll temperature and heat/cool status - everything that should be needed for an automatic solution.

The issues:
1. I’ve regularly had to re-grant access for KeenHome to the ecobee system.
2. Even when access is granted, the KH app only seems to query Ecobee when I change the temperature VIA the KeenHome app (which I don’t want to do).
3. Ecobee can allow a 2 degree delta between heat and cool. KeenHome ignores this and only allows a 3 degree delta.
4. I regularly encounter situations where the heat is running, all rooms but one are cold; the hot room has open vents blowing heat, and the cold rooms have closed vents, in spite of the preferences which should cause the reverse to be taking place.
5. The app itself is buggy. Even trying to request support, the keyboard regularly hides for no reason while typing, the x button in the upper right is so high that it can’t be tapped, and once a support request is submitted, it vanishes from the GUI...
6. Resorting to email support, the first feedback is of course “have you tried turning it off and on again.” This would be forgivable; however, to add insult to injury, I’ve received NO further communication from KeenHome.
Hey guys, provide me with an API, and I’ll just build my own app. Otherwise, please fix your solution and your app!

I’m awarding one star because 1. I have no choice, and 2. The vents DO open and close.. but so did the vents that didn’t cost a hundred bucks each.

 The really good news here is that this is ALL software trouble, so it could be fixed! I’d love to come back and update this review to report that all has been made right, but until that time, I could not be more dissatisfied with this product, the app, and the (lack of) support.";"2019-10-20T17:25:31-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1052372493&type=Purple%20Software";"1052372493";430;"en";"POSITIVE"

The technology is ok, but the software as often the case, requires some work. UI is mostly aimed at initial setup of rooms and vents rather then everyday use—I fail to see the need to easily go into the room removal mode from the main screen for everyday use of the system. Selecting location for hub is important—the more central it is the better.
Currently system does not seem to have a useful logic for the ventilation/fan mode of the HVAC system even with officially supported and integrated (NEST) ones. It simply follows a logic of the current mode (heat/cool).
Some of the functionality is somewhat limited as there are no OEM or third party sensors that seem to work in conjunction with the smart bridge from keen home.
An important point to understand that keen vent built in sensors monitor the condition of the supplied vent and not the room conditions—for a truly responsive system an in room sensor would be needed.";"2016-01-24T10:40:35-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1052372493&type=Purple%20Software";"1052372493";166;"en";"POSITIVE"

I can tell the app to ""identify"" the units and they blink ""hey, I'm here"" but they don't open and close according to the app nor do they report back the actual setting to the app. My Nest thermostat paid for itself in one summer. I figured that the Keen vents along with the Nest would further reduce my heating & air conditioning bills by closing off vents in rooms that I don't use. WRONG! Because the vents don't obey the commands AND the software doesn't work, these vents have actually COST me money! The vents work better with my Samsung Smarthome app but the Keen app is supposed to actually ""think ahead"" and adjust the vents based on history or current readings from the Nest and/or the vents themselves. I paid for the Keen app to work! So far, NADA in getting the app updated. Now I just got word today that the hub software has been updated. That's nice but I want the damned app updated too.

The app is basic but OK.  The hub disconnects often and needs to be reset.  The vents stop responding and you need to remove batteries to reset.  Sometimes the vents can't connect in a small 3 bedroom condo/townhouse.  All vents are on the same floor as the hub and still lots of intermittent issues.

When they do work they are just remote controlled vents with no automation or smarts built in today.  The advertising for the preorder was very misleading on the automation portion and advertised as smart vents.  Today built in sensors are useless.

Support is so so and slow to respond probably because everyone has similar issues or maybe just understaffed.

If they could address just a few of these minor issues, it could be a great system. The fact that they can’t makes me wonder if their programmers are working part-time and only as a hobby. 

I’ve had 9 of these vents throughout my home for a little more than half a year and here are my thoughts. My system originally had one hub paired with an Ecobee and sensors throughout every room. 

Numbers 2 and 4 below are priority for me and probably most customers as well. 

1. Purchased a number of these vents but several arrived very late during the winter.

2. A number of these vents suffer complete disconnects randomly without any app or email notification whatsoever. A temporary solution involves reinserting the batteries.  The app should alert you if the vents go through prolonged or intermittent communication issues. After several complaints, customer support said an additional repeater might help these communication issues. I installed a new hub and it seems like the disconnects have mostly resolved. Still with 9 vents being purchased, you’d think the company by default would send you a hub out of courtesy because of all the money and time spent with tech issues. Tech support did send me one to try to get it working (a bi afraid to send them more money) and it was a big help. 

3. As others have pointed out here, the app still lists “beta” at the top. One Keen employee told me to not use it and that they were planning to remove it. That was almost half a year ago...

4. I repeatedly receive random notices at the top only when opening the keen app that it needs to reauthorize the Ecobee integration. This involves entering my username and password again. There’s no checkbox to save username and pass info either which is a pain with so many passwords. When the app and system disconnects, you lose control of the individual room Ecobee sensor readings temps) that talk to your vents. There’s no notice whatsoever (email or push) that alerts users to the system disconnecting unless you constantly check the app on a daily basis. The app really needs to alert customers to communication issues. 

Talked with customer support again for a number of times on this same issue. They keep telling me they’re working on fixing it which seems like a load of bs. That was months ago. Instead I think they’re trying to market their own sensors to customers although they’ve stated the ecobee sensors supposedly work just as well. 

5. Customer support is poor at getting back to customers. It often involves waiting several hours or a day or two. Think there are only two employees in customer support department... No direct phone number either which is probably intentional.

6. There should be more ability to customize the occupancy schedule within the app. Simply having a range of checkboxes with times is not as good as being able to manually specify exact times.";"2018-06-29T22:52:28-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1052372493&type=Purple%20Software";"1052372493";532;"en";"POSITIVE"
