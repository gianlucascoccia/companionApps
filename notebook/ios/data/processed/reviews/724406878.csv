Gives you something to tap while listening to music but half 75% of the time the app doesn’t recognize the device even when I’m still playing music, so I have to close the app, turn bt off and on, reconnect because it doesn’t try to automatically, then go into the app crossing my fingers, and half the time it shows 3 extra speakers saying “need to be setup” but still doesn’t connect to mine.... so repeat. Finally have it working and your settings ready to go!? Well have fun when you lock your phone and go back into the app because it’s unsynced again... and just a helpful tip, don’t lock your phone while in the app, eventually you’ll have to restart your phone to even get it to work because it bugs out.... the quality of the speaker is what I expected with Sony but the app really ruins their reputation with me if I see “extra features in app”. Recommend the speaker if you just want good sound and bass, but don’t recommend it if you was wanting to use the extra features of the speaker and if that’s you deciding factor between $150 and another good speaker with as good quality for $60...";"2019-03-04T12:31:18-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=724406878&type=Purple%20Software";"724406878";275;"en";"POSITIVE"

#1) Do not follow their instructions. 

#2) Download this app but do not open. 

#3) Take the first speaker and turn it on. 

#4) Press and Hold Power Button. The Bluetooth icon will flash quickly. 

#5) Go to your General Settings, click Bluetooth (will show SRS-XB21 at the bottom), and wait until it has connected. The speaker will also give you a 2-tone beep.  Note, other Sony speakers may have a Bluetooth button.

#6)  Click on the blue ‘i’ circle beside the connected speaker (on your Bluetooth settings on your phone) and disconnect it. 

#7) Follow steps #3-5 to add additional speaker. Disconnect from bluetooth additional speaker you just added and click connect on first speaker. 

#8) Go to the app. Agree to their terms of service, etc. 

#9) You should see a speaker at top. Click to Edit Speaker Group. It will take you to another screen and should show you the second speaker you added. 

#10) Click to Add speakers. This will link them into double mode. From there you can change them to Stereo if you want via the Edit Group button.";"2020-02-27T11:50:16-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=724406878&type=Purple%20Software";"724406878";217;"en";"POSITIVE"

I can almost never pair speakers correctly, and when they do pair, the volume on each gets reset after each song. Most of the time the app just fails to work properly so it doesn’t matter.

This app doesn't have to do much. Just fix the issue where the settings you select won't stay permanent! They only work when the app is open or recently used.

Luckily I only had 4 to maintain during a party and not more or it could have caused the music to fail altogether. 

The speakers are phenomenal. The app is almost a dealbreaker because it makes them seem glitchy.

This app that controls them however, is atrociously bad. Bought 3 of these speakers specifically for a party I hosted and this app alone almost ruined the whole night.

Extremely clumsy and complicated to add other identical sony wireless speakers to it, called a “party chain” which takes at least ten minutes, and multiple dead ends through the app. Once they’re connected, all is good. But then try doing the same thing hours later, with the exact same speakers and the exact same app and you have to go through the whole process again, from scratch, which is insane. Also the app won’t let you “rename” the speakers (e.g. “living room,” “kitchen” “dining room”, etc), so if you buy 3 or 4 wireless speakers and they’re the same color, they’re all labeled “SRS-XB21” in your phone so you have no idea which is in what room. Also you can’t control volume of individual speakers through the app (like Sonos), you have to manually control the volume on individual speakers.

Had to uninstall and reinstall the app it each time I had to set them up (3 total times) which was the only fix that worked.

I have only been able to do the Music Party mode twice. I have had two SRS-XB30 speakers for over almost 2yrs now. The speakers themselves are amazing and I was about to purchase the larger XB40, but if they can’t get the Party Mode feature fixed, I may not. When the Party Mode worked, it was really cool and everyone I showed it to said they had never seen anything like it unless you wanted Sonos style speakers, but those aren’t easily portable. I have done all their troubleshooting and I haven’t got the Party Mode to work for over a year. I was trying to show it off again when we had people over for a patio party, but after an hour of trying, I gave up. It keeps saying my speakers need to be setup. At one point, even tho I only have two speakers, it showed I needed to setup 8 different SRS-XB30 speakers the app found... the reason I am writing this review today is I tried again to setup Party Mode bc we have family over and after 30 min of deleting the app, downloading it again, forgetting the speakers on my Bluetooth list, adding them back following the instructions in the app, I got 7 new speakers that needed to be setup along with the actual connection of the two speakers at the bottom of the app that were “grayed out”, I wasn’t able to select them. Again, the speakers are the best I have come across as for portability, ease of use, great sound, extra bass button, led lights that flash and change color (kids love this feature), water resistant and solidly built. Get the speakers but don’t download the app.";"2018-06-23T09:25:17-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=724406878&type=Purple%20Software";"724406878";308;"en";"POSITIVE"

Sony has taken a square peg and unsuccessfully attempted to jam it into their speakers. The app is so quirky it gives frustration a level you didn’t know existed. Sometimes it works  barely and then most times you spend 1 1/2 hrs trying to connect.  The app is extraordinarily slow and the user interface would even have Nasa engineers scratching their heads and wondering what Sony was thinking, or in this case not thinking.  The app needs a complete ground up Re-engineering. How could you possibly have a stereo mode for two Speakers and not be able to adjust the left/right balance. How basic a blunder that is. The App is so inept at connecting to its own speakers that you may be tempted to breakout your 3.5 mm stereo cord to connect. Don’t they test it before they put it out?? Clearly a rhetorical question. Had they done so we would not be trying to use what may be the worst app ever made. And if you have two speakers like I purchased, good luck figuring out which one is needing your device to be near it to register. They both display the same name Without any differentiation. Not that the app ever remembers that the speakers are registered anyway, and you wind up with a useless list of speakers that claim to need setup even though they had already been set up. Sony needs To get their proverbial act together and stop insulting new customers with an app that must be a product of new math. Make the app intuitive, user friendly and if you can’t do that, then at least make it automated. This app is useless and makes me want to return these great sounding speakers. I can’t even imagine the level of frustration if one were to try and connect with More then two. Well I no longer have to imagine. Purchased another two speakers. My head is about to  explode !!  I feel like throwing these speakers back to song and buying Bose. Just for the App. My frustration level with this app is off the charts. Sony you can do better and must do better to have customers even consider your Bluetooth speakers. Updates that don’t fix obvious use deficiencies are of no use. Go back to the design room and try to use engineering people who actually may test and use the product. Stop throwing garbage In Because this App is garbage out. Hope you can read this and take it back to the drawing board and redo this app. It’s a shame because the great speakers deserve a great App or at the least a useable one.  Looks like 4 speakers  are being returned.

And I’m even happy that there is an app that allows me to EQ the bass away late at night (or turn it up when I’m outside), but beyond that, this app is atrocious. 

First, let’s talk about the volume bugs. Any time any event occurs that caused a sound on your phone outside of the music or video being played, such as a text message, first you get that awful dip in volume that takes it way too far, and then BOOM! Now, for NO reason whatsoever, you are at maximum volume. 

There is no possible justification for this. How does a bug like that slip through, and then everyone goes home at the end of the week and is just like “ahhh whatever, the app kinda works...who cares...”?

Considering Sony is one of the world’s largest media companies, and this is such a simple bug to fix, you’re welcome to hire any number of designers, or ME in fact! And for an extraordinarily low rate, too! When I go to work, I actually care about what I do (Audio Engineer/Postproduction Specialist) and I don’t leave until the job’s done. 

Perhaps consider hiring a likeminded developer to make an app that functions well, has a menu structure and UI that is a little better than the current “os 9” or DOS theme you have going on with arial font size 11 in black for everything and zero creativity at all. 

Speaking of creativity, at least you got creative with the names of the colors! Now I  know that “Calm Cinnabar” means kinda greenish-orangish-ish.

You can't do anything with the stereo until you open the app on the phone or press a small button on the stereo to cancel the message. It's incredibly annoying and if I'd known it would do this I would not have bought this stereo. Actually, other people reviewed the stereo and complained about this same thing and I read those reviews prior to purchasing but I foolishly thought those people must be mistaken -- there MUST be some way to prevent the stereo from demanding an unnecessary app be opened every time the car is started. It just wouldn't make any sense that there is no option to disable such a thing. I was wrong; there is no way to prevent it.
