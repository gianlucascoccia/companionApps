Just the look and feel makes the app less user friendly and not as intuitive as the previous (Colors? Font?  Functionality?).  One pet peeve, why not make the Download list view the same as the recorded All Shows view?  The vanilla Download view is an eyesore, and doesn’t contain enough information (such as the dates on the right hand side) to compare and determine what you’ve downloaded and what you have not.  It takes a lot more analysis.  And the list resets each time you go back to it, so you must scroll to the bottom for the latest downloads each time.  The All Shows list is sorted the opposite, with latest recordings listed first.  I agree, bring back the old interface please.";"2018-10-14T07:37:58-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401673976&type=Purple%20Software";"401673976";140;"en";"POSITIVE"

I don’t like the fact that I can’t stream some of my shows due to flags set by the cable company, but I can live with that. I agree with others that downloads should appear the same as the my shows view. But I rarely have problems streaming shows, and on the rare occasion that a download fails, I delete the download and start it again. 

Adding cellular download ability is great! My biggest complaint is that the app will not download while streaming or download in the background while using another app. I use several streaming apps and they all download in the background. Also, the buttons are too small for my big fat fingers. No reason to make them so small, and not give the user the ability to enlarge them. I think the developers are young, and don’t realize older disabled users have trouble with small tightly grouped buttons and fine print.
