Long story short, I'm transforming my home into a smart home... I decided to get the August smart lock after reading many reviews, to allow access to my door stairs door. Living on the second floor and having to run downstairs 2-3 times a day for mail or delivery gets annoying after doing it for a year! I just installed it yesterday everything works perfectly, even flush-mounted the sensor. I love DIY! My favorite part is the auto-unlock feature. I hate fumbling for keys while my hands are full or the weather is weathering. Now, for the BUT! The App is pretty limited when it comes to setting user permissions under ‚ÄòAccess Level‚Äô. For instance, there's only Owner, Guest, and none. How about adding ‚ÄòFamily‚Äô group. Members who you want to give certain permissions like ‚ÄòAuto-unlock‚Äô and ‚ÄòActivity Feed‚Äô so they can receive phone alerts that the door is open or ajar, but do not have access to changing settings of the device. I think ‚ÄòApp Access‚Äô is laid out well and makes sense. Please consider adding that ability it‚Äôd be very helpful. Thank you! 

Ooh and another thing. Since August in integrated with Alexa and has DoorSense and is able to tell if the door is open or ajar after 1 min why not have the skill notify Alexa devices.";"2021-02-11T18:45:46-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=648730592&type=Purple%20Software";"648730592";240;"en";"POSITIVE"

in general with August in my 3 years of ownership of v1 and v3 locks, and continues daily use of the app, I see such awful design decisions and so much time before they decide to backtrack... for crying out loud, you just had it working perfectly for a few months, how about quick making these half baked changes while you are ahead, or at least let us opt out or may be provide feedback to you prerelease because clearly you don‚Äôt get how some of us use your products";"2018-06-03T16:01:08-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=648730592&type=Purple%20Software";"648730592";254;"en";"NEUTRAL"

It locks my door automatically when closed for a set amount of time (or instantly if I so choose.) While this would seem beneficial in making sure I don't forget or when my hands are full, why would I want to risk being locked out when I simply walk outside for a minute? It would be more practical if I could set it for perhaps an hour or so, in case I  forget to lock it when going out for the day, but the maximum setting is only a few minutes. It would, also, be nice to be able to coordinate the function with the auto unlock, since it would seem logical that if I wanted my door to unlock automatically when returning to my home I might want it to lock automatically when leaving it. I had the idea of enabling auto lock when I was in for the evening so that my door wouldn't remain unlocked all night and wouldn't have to lock it behind me when I left in the morning. Unfortunately, when I returned from work the first day, I waited too long to enter my house after the door auto unlocked and it auto locked, again, forcing me to get out my phone to unlock it. Now, if I want to use it that way, I have to rush to get inside before it locks.

In other words it‚Äôs now faster to open the app, choose your house then send the lock command you want.  And we all know it‚Äôs pretty dumb to have to select your house first before getting to command you lock when you might only have one lock in one house...  August, please quit...

It rarely opens the lock as expected. Maybe two times since Jan 2018. Upon calling tech support, and after I gave him the problem and use scenario, his questions centered on other Bluetooth devices that are on or around me when I expect the door to unlock. Let‚Äôs see, Apple iPhone X, Apple watch, and Apple AirPods. Then he immediately focused in on the AirPods. The technician said to me that the August Pro does NOT work well with Apple AirPods and it is a known ‚Äúissue‚Äù. I asked ‚Äúknown to whom??‚Äù, known to August apparently but no one else knows that would be involved in the presale process it seems. If the BestBuy rep told me about this problem, I simply would not have purchased it. I lay responsibility for this ‚Äúknown‚Äù problem squarely on August and the lack of communication to its resellers about this problem so that consumers can be warned BEFORE a purchase is made. Very irresponsible!! So after all the time, effort and energy with this electronic yet manual lock, I will remove and return it. The funny thing is that Bluetooth wireless communication has an industry standard well established so that manufacture‚Äôs can develop products that will smoothly integrate and work with (reject) other Bluetooth devices within 30ft.

I thought I was hearing things but it was clearly my child and the tv and it was coming from the doorbell cam. After securing my package, I ran and grabbed my phone. I went to the doorbell cam and started speaking with the still locked phone in my hand and I can hear myself. 

This is a privacy concern and I wanted others to know that your microphone is still on even after going back to the home screen and locking your phone. Force quitting the app seems to be the solution so far. I hope August implements a fix for this because I‚Äôm not okay with people being able to listen in on my family and I.

Also, originally I was going to deduct a star cause it‚Äôs not WiFi enabled without a separate WiFi bridge which you have to buy (and based on the reviews the bridge isn‚Äôt great and a lot of people have issues with it so I didn‚Äôt get it), but after using it for a couple weeks I honestly don‚Äôt miss it.

Simply put, this thing has been awesome and has really made a positive impact on my life!

The software works very well and having the home/Away feature enabled on my phone makes the WiFi feature completely irrelevant for me (though if you do airBnB or have to open the door remotely when not at the house it would be critical). 

Since I am not AirBnBing right now, it does exactly what I need, including open the door when I pull up in my driveway without me having to press the button on my phone. 

Also, get the August Widget on iOS, it decreases the number of clicks and time it takes to get to the app when opening and closing the door.

(1) From what I read, I expected the lock to support HomeKit and it does not. In absence of full support, I would love to be able to ask Siri to unlock the door.  This is worth a star rating to me since I expected that I could. (2) Needs faster unlock from the iPhone widget. It just takes too long for the lock to be discovered and unlock. (3) it would be nice to have an Apple Watch complication whose sole job is to unlock the door. ( my original Apple Watch is slow to open its August app). (4) the app should notify me ahead of time that a lock update is available and allow me to choose whether to install it. This has trapped me waiting at the door for an update when I‚Äôm trying to leave the house. (5) the Auto Unlock triggers too far away. This would be more useful to me if it unlocks as I am very close to the door. (Like 3-5 feet).

I‚Äôve owned this lock and have been using this app for almost two years now. During this time I‚Äôve lost my ‚Äúdoor sense‚Äù sensor and while I was unable to find a replacement online, a short and easy call to the support team resulted in them shipping a replacement overnight free of charge. 

My ‚ÄúConnect‚Äù device also maul functioned 3 months after we 1-year warranty expired.  Once again I was shipped a replacement free of charge! The company stands behind its product! 

The only 2 things I‚Äôd wish to change in the app are:
1) the ability to customize a user‚Äôs permission. At this point a user is either a ‚Äúguest‚Äù with very limited functionality or an ‚Äúowner‚Äù with full control.  It would be great to allow my kids the ability to open the door automatically as they approach with their phone while limiting their ability to add users, change settings, etc. 

2) the ‚ÄúAuto Unlock‚Äù function‚Äôs radius around my house is a bit large for us. I often find my self at a neighbor‚Äôs house or walking the dog and still show ‚Äúat home‚Äù on the app.

For example pre iOS 14 if i pressed the unlock button on my Apple Watch the lock unlocked immediately. Now post iOS 14 Im lucky if the lock will unlock or lock at all on my watch, it usually takes at least 3 - 4 attempts - NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

Companies that make smart locks need to understand that they are making a commitment to maintain their software and that a smart lock without working software is USELSS not to mention bad for the planet. 

As a developer who has also worked in the mobile realm I know that the reason for these problems is purely laziness and complacency on August Locks part.

1) the widgets do not work. There‚Äôs a red and green circle to press, but they do absolutely nothing. No other app I have had broken widgets. This is a known problem for a while. 

2) Siri doesn‚Äôt work remotely even with a August Connect device. There‚Äôs no reason for this whatsoever. Supposedly an Apple TV would solve this, but this requirement is senseless, nor would an Apple TV be in range of this device. Which leads to #3. 

3) the Bluetooth reception on the Connect is awful even 3 feet away. All my Bluetooth smart devices work from separate rooms. But this device is so special. Ugh. It took me hours to get the device to connect at all. It‚Äôs it my WiFi (I get full reception on all my devices anywhere on my property). No signal degradation whatsoever. My mesh is setup with Ethernet backhaul. This is kinda mind boggling 

I have cheap Chinese branded smart devices ($10 lightbulbs, $20 switches, etc) that all work with Siri with customizations, and they work perfectly remotely with Siri and all my devices. But not August, my most expensive smart device. 

This is a lock that I have to trust my home with, and they can‚Äôt get basic feature to work after quite some time. I hate to complain.

5). Speaking of the speaker, you can

My biggest complaint is there is either guest or full admin access. There really should be level in between. Where you can have those users take advantage of the location aware features like auto unlock but not have full admin control to add and remove any user. 

For instance. I have a few relatives living with me. While I do trust them I would rather not give them the keys to the castle so to speak. They could actually downgrade my account to guest. And i am the home owner. Seems silly to me. 

So August developers and product owners if you are listening, please add a ‚Äúgeneral user‚Äù to the account levels. There should only be one super admin.

You should implement a slider on the lock so I can delete it, or an Edit button so I can select the lock I want to remove from the list.
