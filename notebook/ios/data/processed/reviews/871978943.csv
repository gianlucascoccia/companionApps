Of course cost has risen but I checked the last 2 summers and it still has not exceeded $160 month. Remember I’m only talking about 1 months bill, so the savings has been several hundreds since getting the Skydrop in 2015. People are upset about $2/month. This is a no brainer.  And I will also say their customer support is 5 Star. When I have had technical issues in the past, they took care of it. 

Come on people, they have provided a service that for free for years, and I can only assume that now the programming will equate to greater savings both monetarily and for our environment.

My lawn has died in spots and I’ve reseeded more times than I’d like to remember because of spotty watering performance.

This has been a great product and spending $2 month is still cheaper than buying a new controller; $24 opposed to $200. I would give 5 stars but it doesn’t work well with Alexa and the future stability is questionable, so I give a solid 4 stars!!!

That’s all gone. The app is useless now and watering restrictions are the only control you have over watering. 

What’s worse is there customer service. I changed my WiFi password and the controller lost connection. Rather than staying on the current schedule and adhering to my watering restrictions, the controller defaulted to watering every day, but only at night/ early morning so i didn’t notice... until I got my water bill for $1200! That’s when I noticed the password was not updated on the controller and I fixed it. I called Skydrop to see why that was the default behavior and they treated me like I didn’t understand the cloud (I’m a cloud software developer) and were not helpful. A few months after that, the app update included a “back up” schedule option in case WiFi connection is lost....

Needless to say, I’m researching new controller options. If you want to pay the same price for a “smart controller” and only get a better user interface in your garage and an app, this ones for you.

***An absolute waste of $18 for an app/website that is useless late October into early April.***

What sold me two years ago is the remote use via your easy to use website and app, absolutely free.  Then just recently the excuse came via email of “increased cloud costs” in order to bleed more money out of us as your customers.  To me, that sounds more like a “bait and switch” move.

Attention from SkyDrop

Due to the increased costs associated with maintaining the Skydrop Cloud, including the hyper-local weather data, it has become necessary for Skydrop to implement a monthly service fee. Beginning in the first part of June 2019, you will see some changes to Skydrop Web and Skydrop Mobile. These changes will include a limit to the functionality to manage and monitor your Skydrop Controller. You will still be able to see very basic information about your controller but changing the watering restrictions, watering schedule, adjusting zones and running zones manually will be disabled. Within Skydrop Mobile, you will see an option to upgrade to Skydrop Plus. Skydrop Plus includes not only the functionality to manage your controller, but also advanced reporting, more precise weather data, enhanced notifications, and more.";"2019-06-10T20:56:42-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=871978943&type=Purple%20Software";"871978943";282;"en";"POSITIVE"

I purchased Skydrop  a couple of years ago and paid a little extra money to have what actually was a great system.
As of last week they decided to change the app so there was no longer any functionality left unless you purchased the “plus” version. 
I was not happy to have to now pay more for something I had already purchased. 
But I said wth and just paid for the plus fictionality. It was $1.99 a month.  
After paying for the Apple subscription I went back to the app only to find out that it will NOT work. 
I called skydrop support several times and after holding for almost 30 mins listening the the auto attendant count down to me being the #1 call in line only to only have it click over and send me to voicemail.  This happened each time I called support. They also don’t respond to the voicemail. Which is insult after injury after insult. 
So interestingly it seems this company had turned from an incredible product to the biggest scam overnight. 
I’m searching out a new replacement controller this weekend and will be taking the opportunity to tell everyone I can not to buy skydrop. 
It’s such a shame for them too because I have contacts at #Lowes #Homedepot #walmart and will be sharing this story with the buyers at each.  
If they were selling any product they can kiss those future orders goodbye. 
At least I might help keep their now terrible product out of the hands of hundreds To thousands of other unsuspecting customers.

They tried sending me a link explaining how they failed at managing their operations and had to create a user fee, without notifying their customers. It further explains how the company doesn’t know how to manage their finances, our day to day operations. I’d expect an increase in hidden costs that the company comes up with. For a suggestion, I would recommend going with any other company or product that does smart watering for your lawn. The simple answer is that others don’t charge, and they do the same thing. This company has essentially gone under. Stay away from their product, as it will soon be unusable. They should just go with option 3 (see below). 

Their response:
“At the end of 2018 and after exhausting all options, Skydrop ownership made the difficult decision to discontinue operations. The immediate concern was for the many loyal customers that would see their smart controllers reduced to being dumb traditional timers when the Skydrop Cloud ceased operating. A few of the passionate (former) employees wanted to find a way to maintain the Skydrop Cloud and determine a path forward so that customers could continue using the devices and services they have enjoyed. The owners agreed to allow us to at least maintain the cloud services and retain a single full-time customer support employee.

For the last several months, as we have transitioned to positions at new companies, we have volunteered our time and personal resources to keep the cloud services up and available. Of course, this is not a long-term solution. We need to get Skydrop onto reasonable financial footing so it can either be acquired or continue operations with a few full- or part-time employees. Our options were: 1) increase sales (hard to do with no sales or marketing team); 2) ask the existing customers to pay a minimal fee to support the continuing availability of the cloud services or 3) shut down the cloud services immediately”.

Had this device for three years. It used to work ok, but would randomly drop WiFi. The problem with it is, the company decided to make the app unusable unless you pay them a monthly fee. This wasn’t the case for the last three years. Now they expect you to pay them to be able to use your $200 device. It’s garbage. Don’t get it.

If you get past the lies and the monthly cost, you get a newly updated entirely cruddy dysfunctional system.  

My schedules were set correctly, and I came home from vacation to a burnt lawn!   Yep!  Even though my schedules say all zones active - and if I MANUALLY start the system, all zones get watered - but the system only watered ONE zone over and over.  Turns out it’s been weeks since some zones were watered even during our drought and heat wave!   *Im not the only one who’s complained about this - so it’s not user error Skydrop*

It’s junk.  Don’t buy the system, and don’t bother with the app.  I think the 1.6 star rating says it all boys and girls.   They sold tens (hundreds?) of thousands of these controllers with a “no additional cost promise”... then once they were all installed, turned on their customer base and 1.  Wont take it back.  2. The stripped the functionality away unless you pay a subscription which renders all of its features useless unless you pony up!  

Hey Skydrop!  Nobody gives a rip about your explanation of forcing a subscription on us!   Whatever relationships you need in place to make the unit work & to sell the thing isn’t your customers problem!   That’s on you to have built it into your cost of doing business when you sold these things!   Or you shouldn’t make promises you don’t keep!

Instead, at the stroke of midnight it shuts off. I then realized the other zones were watering early AM the night before as keeping all the watering on that one day. 

Where this gets annoying is when I want to water Saturday night after I mow and not Friday night as I would like my lawn dry to mow. However because I am set to water Saturday it waters the back lawn at 12am Saturday Morning. So it's all wet when I wake up. 

Please allow the watering to go in sequential order!!! And since the smart human waters at night when the sun isn't out, it makes things annoying when one full cycle can't all be done in one night.

The app does try to make decisions based upon weather and rain predictions, but, I have the added complexity of only being allowed to water on Tues. and Sat. due to local restrictions.  This does make it necessary for the controller to allow watering even if we had rain recently.  I was told by Support that this is necessary since it knows how many days before we can water again and it determines to water even though we have had rain.  I think it could do a much better job if I did not have to limit what days the sprinklers can be on.  All in all, I think it does a better job than the old style controllers.

1) I can still control my sprinklers from the panel itself and I'm not limited to a smart device. My personal phone is actually a flip phone so having the option to change and use the controller itself was a must

2) The app was elegant, simple and easy to use and provided a host of watering options I felt I just didn't get from the other controllers.

3) It appeared to be full proof to install and and really takes the guesswork on how to use it. It also gives you the option to create your own timer in case you have a specific watering plan you needed to have in place.

4) It looks the best! When I walk into my pitch black garage and see the bright green ring all lit up it looks like something from the future!

My only wish would be to have and even larger variety of plant options or have a ""grass seed"" setting.

App setup VERY smooth. So much easier to program and control than the ultra-confusing Rainbird box. LOVE THIS APP!!! Plus, troubleshooting the different watering stations are so easy since you can just use your phone … no more running back and forth the manually test the stations. Plus the app allows changing water restrictions “on the fly” (something important for us experiencing the drought here in Texas).

The app has a friendly, intuitive design that makes me wonder why Rainbird never thought of coming out with a WiFi controller before this. The interface between the app and the browser are very smooth … so going back and forth between desktop and mobile is very easy.

Update:
I've now lost almost all confidence in the app. The app says one thing, but the system does another:
1.  I get notifications from the app that it's going to skip watering because it has been raining. Great!
2.  I check the app, and indeed it says that it's not going to water for the next few days. Great!
3. The unit begins watering at the next opportunity. Really?  :/

This has happened multiple times now. I just can't recommend this system anymore with all of the difficulties I've had now with the unit. 

---------------------
In general, the app works well and provides a nice interface to schedule watering.

One request:  it would be nice to have a way to skip the next watering cycle. Right now, the user must disable watering before and re-enable after to skip a single cycle.

I recently had a valve fail on me.  The app and controller both notified me of the shorted valve and troubleshooting the solenoid to replacement was quick and easy! The controller even continued normal watering, taking that zone out of rotation, until I managed to replace the solenoid.

This system is way too expensive considering how unpolished it is. I didn't expect to be the beta tester when paying double the price of the average controller. Issues:

1.  Doing a custom schedule for a zone allows adding several different start times within the same schedule. (Ex 3x/day) Adding more than one session in the same schedule resulted in the system not doing any of them. I had to schedule each start time as a separate schedule and even then it will occasionally miss one of the waterings. 

2. The app and website are very clunky. You can see what is scheduled to happen, but not whether or not it actually did happen. This info may not be necessary if it wouldn't have missed several watering sessions.

I made sure to label each wire before disconnecting from old controller. I installed 6 zones worth of wiring and it was a little tight feeding it through the opening. You just have to be patient and route them perfectly. I have a well setup for my water supply and everything interfaced nicely. I was mounting to concrete block so I bought adhesive strips to attach the unit to the wall. I didn't feel like drilling into concrete so this worked perfectly.  Setup was pretty simple after I added a wifi booster. My controller is about 20 feet from my house in a storm shelter underground - Skydrop needs a really strong signal.  It is definitely easier to setup Skydrop using the app functions. There are a few options I would like to see added to the app. One would be a sprinkler test function. A canned short runtime of zones would help at the beginning of the season for sprinkler maintenance checks. Also I would like to see a garden zone feature in the app as I utilize Skydrop to water my garden. I currently have the garden sprinkler zone disabled and just manually enable it to run. I will probably just create a dedicated schedule for that zone- but think it would be better to tailor specific for a garden zone. The soil types listed really don't match my soil type by description- so I selected unsure. What about normal draining type soil? I know this is way out there- but maybe wind data could be integrated as it gets very windy in Kansas. Wind definitely affects coverage- maybe there could be a wind cutoff feature for forecasted high winds. Maybe there could be an external antenna hookup for better wifi reception for below ground installs.

Overall it has been a great part of my home management systems.  I especially like how it lets me tell it how type of soil is in the zone, what kind of sprinkler heads are in the zone (I have rotors, rotary nozzles, and regular nozzles through the various zones), and even the slope of the yard/bed in that zone.  I also have Nest products, and since Skydrop ""works with Nest"", I get a monthly update on my water usage in my Nest Home Report, as it includes Skydrop watering info.  That info help me determine how much I'm using in my home as my municipal water bill gives me a grand total for home and sprinklers.  I rated the app as 4 stars because there were some issues with the controller, or the app, a couple of months back.  I think they finally updated everything, because I haven't had any issues in the last few weeks.  All I needed to do was reset the controller to make it work again, which was a hassle, but infrequent.  Lastly, some people complain about the controller's ability to water or not water when it is raining, or when it has rained.  I use the IFTTT (If This, Then That) app, in conjunction with the Skydrop app.  Between the two, I'm never watering while it is raining.  When you properly tell Skydrop how much watering time your yard needs, it is very smart and knows when to not water after a recent rain.  Take a yard rain gauge, put it in your yard, and measure the amount of water over a given time.  I know how much time each zone needs to run to give my yard 1"" of rain every 4 days.  Skydrop gets it all done, giving the water enough time to soak in (especially on hills), so that my roots grow deep and I give my yard the 1"" of water it needs.";"2017-08-10T12:49:16-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=871978943&type=Purple%20Software";"871978943";329;"en";"POSITIVE"

The others force you to use the app on your device. I sometimes get my irrigation service provider to work on my zones and I want him to be able to operate the system with out grabbing my phone especially when I am not at home. I am a technologist and an engineer so I feel like I know what I am doing to some extent. 

Installation of the hardware on my wall was difficult but that was based on my wiring being attributed to 11 zones. I had to buy the extender. If starting this process from scratch try and keep your zones for your yard to 8 or under if possible. The extender (for 9-16 total zones) makes the wiring a touch more complicated. But the initial installation was ok. 

Sky drop folks: make the opening on the bottom of each slat larger and kill the rubber opening. Just make the hardware as open and free of obstacles to insert the wires. 

Underlying all of this is that I want to just set it and forget it and allow my watering to just occur and my grass/foliage to be just ""handled"" 

Use case 1: Whatever the baseline default watering pattern the app creates for you based on soil condition etc doesn't water long enough to keep my lawn from turning brown. It's imperative you create your own schedule and stick to that. Using the program sky drop creates based on soil conditions is not enough water and doesn't water frequently enough. 

Use case 2: I created a new schedule for August. However when I go to the home screen it still shows the watering pattern of some sort of default option. I increased the watering time for the ""August"" watering schedule but the time remaining to water is the fewer minutes attributed to the original default pattern. 

Use case 3: trying to see what the history of the watering in recently (part of the update in July) shows certain zones are being watered but others weren't based on inherent rain fall. It appears that 2-3 zones out of my 11 were watered. That's not what I want. Again this is that default organically created watering pattern that just shows up on the home screen. (I need to keep trying this but I think this may be fixed now) 

Use case 4: one of my zones appears to be active but that zone never turns on. It is probably something to do with my wiring but again the app shows that it is being watered when in fact no water is being distributed. 

I have more thoughts but I will start with this. I can't seem to find a contact email through your app. That might be helpful too but I am going to email my suggestions to your website later today.

Still having consistent connection issues. It is disconnected more than it's connected. I thought they made ""huge behind the scene updates to the cloud"", yet they still can't handle the server loads during peak season. This company is proving to be incompetent. 

Updated post:

Cloud issues are really bad. Smart watering hasn't worked in 2 weeks. Weather report is off. I get conflicting information from different pages on the app. Refreshing doesn't pull the latest data from the cloud. It is more trouble than a regular timer at this point. Disappointing. 

Original post:

I have had multiple issues with the app and the website. They don't seem to talk with each other. I can be looking at the two of them at the same time, one says it's water and the other says it's not. 

My notifications don't work properly. They show up in the history on the app, but they are not pushed to my phone. 

Recently, my controller glitched and it thought it was the future. Is said it was this up coming sat morning, when it was Thursday night. As a result, it want watering my grass when it should have been. Is was a big problem since I am still in the 2 week new sod timeframe. 

So far, Skydrop has been more work than a regular controller, and the weather logic doesn't seem to work well. I hope it improves quick, or this buy will be a dud.";"2017-06-28T04:24:39-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=871978943&type=Purple%20Software";"871978943";299;"en";"POSITIVE"

I am NOT going to pay a monthly subscription for a company that is basically already out of business. The developer’s response is a little late, frankly. They should have been forthcoming when the software was initially locked down. I will be buying another WiFi controller from a name-brand company to insure it will still be functional in the future. I would encourage no one to invest any money in this company.  I would encourage the company to do the right thing and just shut down because taking money from well-intentioned people when they (the company) knows fully well they will not be around is unethical. 

I have used the Skydrop WiFi controller for about three years. It has always been a little glitchy and often loses connection even though there is a WiFi extender right next to it and no other devices lose connection. Most controllers would still activate at the scheduled times, but not the Skydrop. If the connection is lost, no watering. 
Now the company has decided to do a bait-and-switch. They have now made their app inoperable unless you pay them a monthly fee. They claim that this is because the weather service for Smart watering is expensive, but instead of charging for smart watering, they have removed any ability to control the controller via the app. So, the controller is now no better than a cheap, manual controller. I predict this company will be out of business within months if not weeks. I plan to remove the Skydrop controller and purchase a WiFi controller from Rainbird or Orbit. It’s really a shame because Skybird could have been a good device if the company hadn’t succumbed to greed.";"2019-06-23T21:00:12-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=871978943&type=Purple%20Software";"871978943";294;"en";"NEGATIVE"

You should at least grandfather in the old customers, instead of just shutting them down.

*update 6/23/2019*

In response to my review, I received a link to a full disclosure letter from Skydrop.
Now that I fully understand their situation, I will be doing my part and subscribing to their service on a monthly basis to support these guys in hopes that Skydrop will remain the great product that I’ve grown accustomed to using.
IMO, The monthly fee is a small price to pay for the convenience to control my sprinkler systems.

I have received an email from Skydrop today regarding the extra costs that I have to pay to maintain the functionality I once had for free. I believe that this is pretty misleading since when I bought the sprinkler I was advertised that there would be NO fees. Had I known that there would be costs in the future I would’ve went with a Rachio or RainMachine which gives its users free remote control and weather data from not 1 station like Skydrop but 4. I am quite confused as to why Skydrop cannot keep up with these costs when other companies like Rachio and RainMachine can. Furthermore, my Nest thermostat also relays data from weather.com and I have to pay $0 for that. I still can’t comprehend why there is justification that the weather service is that pricey. I believe that if it is true that Skydrop Plus is being released that it is very misleading to the customers like me who bought into the system assuming that it was free. I will sadly have to revise the review I wrote on Amazon for this product as there is no way I could justify the price of this controller when others can do the job better and for free. I hope that if this subscription does become a part of your business model that I can obtain a full refund for the price I paid for the unit. I am extremely disappointed by the news I have heard today and hope that there can be some remedy.

This was the email I sent to support. Still no response back so I’m hoping Lowe’s can step in if this subscription does come into play. Skydrop’s algorithm never worked properly despite no subscription fees. It would often neglect weather data and water my lawn the next day after a heavy rainfall despite the ground being super wet. I think the most misleading part is where they advertised on their website that there were no additional subscription fees. “No. There are no additional fees or costs associated with the purchase or use of this controller.” It is funny that while other controllers like RainMachine can take weather data from 4 different sources and not charge their customers as well as integrate with moisture sensors, Skydrop cannot citing prohibitive costs for their business model. Lastly, the app is pretty clunky and will crash on older iPhones such as the iPhone 7 Plus. For anyone in the market for a smart sprinkler right now I would recommend anything that doesn’t have subscription fees and is guaranteed to stick around in the long run: Orbit B-Hyve, Rachio, etc..

Today I received an email from the company indicating that, beginning in early June, the functionality of the controller I purchased would be severely limited unless I began to subscribe to their new service for $1.99 a month (or $17.99 a year).  It will still work as a manual controller, but the “smart” part of the controller that reacts to weather cycles will be shut off.

This is a shameful business practice.  I bought the controller for the functionality it provided, not so that I could have yet another subscription so that the company would not nerf the product I bought years ago.  If the company wanted to put this practice in place for new users going forward, that is certainly their right. But to impose this change on users who bought the controller in good faith for a set price is simply wrong.  

I hope that Skydrop will reconsider this decision.  But unless they do I would be very wary of doing any business with a company with such a flexible ethical set.
