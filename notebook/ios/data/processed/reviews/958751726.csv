You follow?

AVI-on has his bumps in the road but I think they all do, it’s still new technology so a lot of problems in this stage of the game are unavoidable no matter which brand you go with. I picked up in Avi-on product at target one day just to give it a try and it worked out pretty good. The product line isn’t as robust as others but that gives you a chance to get familiar with how the concept works. 

So in closing I have found Avi-on products at different prices from different places out there, so if you wanna do your due diligence you can find cheaper prices -it is what it is.";"2019-07-22T05:14:41-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=958751726&type=Purple%20Software";"958751726";172;"en";"POSITIVE"

I must say that after trying numerous smart devices, the most important aspect is that your products function for years to come without failure and with very minimal maintenance and upgrades. Avi-on smart plugs have been functioning well in our home. We experienced glitches and inconveniences with their software upgrades. Once the software was settled and glitches fixed, the lights are working as expected. We want to keep our kids safe and sound at home. The smart plugs products have helped us achieve that for 3 years now. We bought ours in the stores. Here is another thing: we do not want to spend $40 on smart devices. This is way too expensive for ordinary American families. It adds up fast with every single device and software costs. It is too too much. Who can afford $400 iPhones year after year?!? Oh maybe software makers can!?! They make good money. But we don’t!! We buy what we need, not what we like!  So I got my Avion plug for $25 at a local store, which was affordable price. Others weren’t as lucky as I. After 3-4 years, my Avi-on products are still all working in my home with zero maintenance and no fail. So I am a very happy Mom.

I bought two new outdoor switches and although the switches worked I could not get the app to function properly. I contacted the Avi-On support team and they immediately responded within an hour or two. My switches had old firmware that needed updating but the app would not display the update symbol needed to initiate the update as well as some other functions such as changing the name of Devices or deleting schedules. The support team worked with me to try to resolve this problem. When no headway was being made they sent me two new switches that they had updated the firmware and I sent back my two with their prepaid shipping. After many emails back and forth they regenerated my account and I deleted the app and re-downloaded the app. Everything thing then worked. I can’t say enough about the support team for tirelessly pursuing the resolution to my problem. They went well beyond my expectations with email responses and phone calls that in some cases were after their normal business hours. My system now works perfectly.

I set it up to turn a lamp on and off in the living room twice a day so my dogs won’t have to sit in the dark before I get home now that it gets dark so early. While setting it up there was not a single mention that it requires a remote access bridge to connect to it when I’m out of range. Because of that I’m not able to make any adjustments to the timer if I find I’m going to be out later than the lamp is set to turn off. The fact that that information is not anywhere in the instructions is extremely deceptive. 

Furthermore, after some googling I found I could connect to it via the Alexa app. NOPE. Alexa can’t find the device even if I’m sitting right next to it. I’m returning this piece of crap (the Avi-on device, not my Echo) and getting something else.

There’s a few different controls and devices, from the RAB which lets you control over the internet from anywhere, And the outlet switch that lets you use Bluetooth to dim/control ANY LIGHT you’ve already got installed: fluorescent, LED, especially incandescent, and Phillips Hue...provided its already dimmable obvi.
And the Bluetooth switch I mentioned is super cool, from your phone you can control literally any lamp in your house and program complex routines or simple ones  to turn on whenever you need. 
And there’s more! It’s been a life saver with energy bills $$$ And for our older dog who needs to see and for waking up and going to sleep along with just having total control from your phone. Pretty dope!

It relies on Bluetooth, which means that your iPhone or iPad must be near the devices to control them. (Remote control requires a proprietary gateway.) 

The limitations of this technology notwithstanding, the Avi-on app is a disaster. Half the time, tapping on the three dots to open a context menu for a device turns the device on or off, and half the time, it opens the desired menu.

Design errors in the app mean that not all context options are accessible when they should be. Getting device information, for example, is accessible from a secondary context menu, but the three-dot icon to open that menu is hidden by a + icon half the time. (When you've opened the first context menu and are thus working with a particular device, it makes no sense to be able to add other devices.)

Security for (required, server-side) Avi-on accounts is an afterthought. The only way to change your password is by pretending you've forgotten it, according to the company's support page. With no security questions or other verification measure, anyone with access to the password reset link -- sent in cleartext, to your last e-mail address -- can take over your Avi-on account.

GE makes you setup this 3rd party app to run the switch, isn’t GE supposed to be smart?  Nope.

AVI-On wants to know your name, email, location, man, woman, shoe size, type of underwear, all to get a simple FN Bluetooth connection to a switch?  Wow

So then after all that, AVI-ON then makes you wait for email verification, which now running on 8 hours later - nothing.  Can’t use the fukn product until this completed.

Subsequent upgrades fixed most of the major complaints and the app is much more stable now.   There has not been any more firmware upgrade thank goodness.   However there are still some gremlins from time to time.  All my devices disappeared out of the blue last week.   Logging off/on didn’t help.  Had to delete and reinstall the app to get back my devices.  

Upgrading to 3 stars.  When the app is stable Avi-on is actually quite nice to use.  Fingers crossed that the app stays stable and continue to improve. 

—————————-
Original post :  upgrade nightmare 
I use 5 of these things to control everything from landscaping lighting to recirculating water pumps.  They worked really well and were easy to set up.  All was good until came time for upgrade.
App upgrade was bad, firmware upgrade on the devices was a nightmare.
Upgraded the app several times over the past year.  Issues include lost schedule, lost devices and now, duplicated devices.  Each of my device now have a clone.  Removing the duplicate made it worse.  The device stopped working completely. Forcing the device to resync with the app just caused the app to crash.
Then came the firmware upgrade.  There were two upgrades in the last few months. That doesnt sound too bad except the firmwate upgrade has to be done on each device individually and it requires turning Bluetooth on/off couple of times during the upgrade process.  It's a time consuming process and to make things worse, something would usually go wrong during or after the upgrade.  
I haven't figured out how to fix the latest batch of issues.  Might have to go the nuclear option and do a hard reset on all the devices and start over.   Not looking forward to it.  
Avi-on, you have a nice product but your software department needs to get the act together.   A device like this should just work.  It shouldn't be a hassle or a headache to run.  It performs a very simple task so just keep it simple.  Please!";"2019-05-17T23:13:01-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=958751726&type=Purple%20Software";"958751726";341;"en";"POSITIVE"

This app works to dim my LED lights and it’s possible to set a schedule to turn them on at specific times with specific dimness. However, there are several features that could be better. 
1. Setting the dimness is not very precise. I often like my lights between 8%-30% bright. The digital slider is very difficult to land on either of these numbers or even settle on one. When sliding from 25% down to 10, lifting the finger off the screen can swing the value 10 or more because the slider size is only maybe a 1/4” inch between 0 and 30. Having a better way to Zoom into low values would help greatly. 
2.  It’s takes an infinity to open and connect to the lights. Like 10 seconds or more. This time, when wanting the lights on or off, seems like forever. The app has to find the light every time it opens, even if you just closed it. There has got to be a remembered connection to hasten the connection. 
3.  I am pretty good with figuring even complex systems and softwares, but this app nearly takes the cake for being non intuitive. Setting the schedule to turn on the lights at 6:30am with a dimness starting at 5% and slowly rising to 20% is possible.  But it might take an hour of messing with the app to make it work. It could be way easier. 
4.  If a schedule is set, you can’t then override the schedule with the light switch on the way. If you do turn off the scheduled lights with the paddle, the lights go crazy and start flickering like mad. I have attempted several ways to get around this but all have failed. 
So, it works but could be so much better.";"2019-08-21T18:46:11-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=958751726&type=Purple%20Software";"958751726";322;"en";"POSITIVE"

Update: I was contacted by an Av-ion customer service rep and he concluded that my switches had the old firmware. He then activated the firmware updates that would allow me to see the yellow exclamation points on the devices that needed firmware updates. Great. But, the app still wouldn't connect to my devices. So, I went outside and tried to connect to an outdoor switch, and guess what? It did! This allowed me to update the firmware on that switch and reset my schedules. I then went back inside the house and updated the inside switch that the app wouldn't see in the first place. So on edit, the app now works and I changed my review to 3 stars.

The only way I can get my device to work is to manually touch the physical on/off/dim button. The app itself has only one function now: to turn my device off - just by starting the app. If the app is running there is no way the device will work. Only when the app is closed will the device operate. When I do have the app open it says that no devices are found. Really? Well if the device is on it finds the device without problem and turns it off.
I have a second issue with this app in that it attempts to login every time the app is started. Login? Why ever should a Bluetooth controlling device need to login?  I understand if I had multiple devices attached to the app and they were spaced around the world then maybe having a location login then maybe...
 The concept of Bluetooth is that it is local only and device restricted. My Bluetooth earbuds are not required to ""log in"" and they work 100% as advertised. My device was not inexpensive and I would expect for the price the same performance as my earbuds. There is something fishy about this logging in. Overall this app stinks.
I suggest to the app developers/ marketing hacks to stop their grandiose dreams of controlling the world and start with the simple on/off switch
Added for update 1.5.1 : rating remains same = less than 1 star.

I updated my iPhone to IOS 13 & ever since the app gives the following error message: “Please turn Bluetooth on. In order to use Avi-on, the Bluetooth radio on your phone must be ON.” I’ve had no issues with any other apps or Bluetooth devices since the IOS 23 update - only the Avi-on app. The GE timer is still following the schedule & can be operated manually, but that defeats the purpose, especially when I need to change the schedule which is only available in the app! After 5 days of being asked to repeatedly follow the same exact steps by Avi-on support, only to get no results or resolution, I’m ready to find a different Bluetooth timer with a more stable & user friendly app. I’m beyond frustrated with all the time wasted trying to fix a problem that shouldn’t exist. Apparently I’m the only person experiencing this issue with IOS 13, though I’m inclined to believe others may not have contacted Avi-on support or just gave up.";"2021-11-12T22:44:11-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=958751726&type=Purple%20Software";"958751726";254;"en";"NEGATIVE"

Update on 11/9/2017:  Since the last iOS update I now have to log in to the app at least very two days, which kind of kills all the convenience. Not sure if it is an app or iOS issue.  Either way it is very frustrating. 

There is a glitch in the latest update, and the update devices it does.  I'm using an iPad, and two iPhones, each of the Idevices wants to update all of the connected devices, and the last iPhone I started the app on showed three times as many devices as I actually have. To get that straight I had to unload and reload the app. 

Other than that the app and updated devices work great.  It allows me to turn switches on and off, schedule them, run countdowns, and dim those with dimmers just as advertised.

I would NOT recommend this product to anyone.  The app itself is poorly designed and is very counterintuitive.  The “Outdoor Smart Switch” ought to be called the “Dumb Switch”.  I purchased this dumb switch about a month ago and it worked just fine, with the outdoor lights set up on the timer option... took a bit to get it set up though.  But now, it is COMPLETELY unresponsive... I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app on both android and apple devices, separately, and I tried resetting the switch by unplugging it and plugging it back in...  the app keeps saying that it cannot find my network and the dumb switch itself will turn on the lights briefly and then shut itself off.  This is a bad product and poorly constructed app, and is not worth your time or money.  I would rate this zero stars if I had the option.

They are simple to set up, simple to use, and reliable.  The advantage of Bluetooth is low power and user complexity, while WiFi offers greater benefits but more overhead and a potential path to hack your home network- so I think GE made the right choice for the time.

The Avi-On app is deceivingly powerful, as you can use it both as a simple remote as well as an easy interface to program schedules with a lot of capability:  from/to dawn/dusk, particular hours can be mixed in, as well as days of the week, yielding possibilities such as “turn the front light on at dawn until 9:00 am on Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays.”  And it’s even more flexible as you can have up to 10 schedules per switch.  So you could add “Turn the front light on at dusk until 11:00 pm.on Wednesdays.”  You would then get the sum of both schedules.

There is also a countdown timer you can use ad-hoc, and a variety of subscription based features to create grouped functionality, like presets for a room of lights.  IMHO the world is full of far too many hi-tech companies delusional that everyone will agree to pay monthly - in this case potentially forever - to have some small service like this.  So we’ll stick with the great bundled capabilities.  

I should mention, though, that you will need to set up a free on-line account to enable any lasting functionality.  The benefit is your device programming and settings are backed up.  And I have found their on-going customer support to be exceptional.  This includes help with the product, as well as rapid turn around in the rare case you identify a software issue.

Really my main complaints are twofold.  One is that EVERY SINGLE TIME an update is pushed, you have to log back in to the controller.  This is terrible, and if they want to survive they must address this.  I have >50 apps on my iPhone; if I had to do this with all of them I’d throw my phone away!

The other, which might be unavoidable, is how long the app takes to refresh EVERY TIME YOU SWITCH TO IT.  Beyond annoying, and another show stopper to real market adoption.

But for now if you have a short list of items you’d find handy to remotely switch, this is any easy way to get it done.  It sure helped while I spent the first half of this year recovering from both cancer and a violent assault, allowing me to switch lights and such while stuck in my recliner.  Or turning Christmas lights outside on and off, while warm inside!

Hope this is helpful to someone.";"2018-06-11T05:09:27-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=958751726&type=Purple%20Software";"958751726";475;"en";"POSITIVE"
