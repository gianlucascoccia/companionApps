But what makes me rate this ones start short of great, is the fact that once you add number to the blacklist, there's no way to remember — say days or a week later — if you blacklisted that number. Where as on the website when you blacklist a number there is a visual cue (a red circle with a line through it) that let's you know that you have successfully added that number to the blacklist. 

Currently, when you go back to look at at number you may have blacklisted the day before, it still says ""Add to Blacklist"" as if you never took any action on that number. And if you tap that link, it takes you through the process as if you didn't blacklist it. That made me have go to the website just to double check that it the blacklist was actually applied — which renders the efficiency and convenience of the new feature moot. It can be something like turning the ""Add to Blacklist"" red or replacing that with the red circle with the line through it (like on the website) to let you know that you were sucessful in blacklisting a number.";"2017-08-01T08:23:12-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1074074904&type=Purple%20Software";"1074074904";228;"en";"POSITIVE"

I live in Australia but have a US phone number and it makes it so easy for me to contact friends and family overseas for very little cost.  I appreciate not having to be home to call the states. It has really added a new element to the convenience to it.  The app probably isn't very helpful if you don't have a paid in my account however, in my case I do.

I am having 2 issues though, I live in Australia but I have a US phone number through Ooma and even though I put my phone on do not disturb when I go to sleep at night the Ooma  calls still come through loud and clear waking me up at night, need to figure out a way to change those settings. 

The other thing that is problematic, when I’m on my cell phone app and I arrive home, call disconnects. So that’s a bit of a bummer sometimes, but overall I love that I can call with Emma from my cell phone now!  especially for our situation.

The app has fallen short of being useful anymore. It errors constantly, doesn’t forward many calls and if you decide to reinstall it forces you to sign up for their premier service without any ability to bypass and just log into your account. 
Customer service has been useless and they send me to their technical service, but you cannot understand them and all they want you to do is reinstall again. 
I believe that the forcing you to sign up for the premier service each time you install is a violation of some type of law and I plan on writing letters to several organizations so that future customers are not dinged with their horrible tactics. 
The app has not even been updated decently for a long time. They just fixed it enough to work on the current iOS, but no fixing the large bugs that are in the app. Being a VOIP they could offer texting, but they refuse to add it in.

The app has been optimized for iPad, all aspects of it function perfectly, and several new features have even been added. This is now a truly great app to use. Thank you Ooma.

(My former comments about issues now resolved: ""I have only had experience with the Ooma app on iPad Pro 9.7 and iOS 10, so it may work better on an iPhone, or on an older version of iOS - but, the app is in need of an update. The volume control does not work, the mute control does not work, and the app's display orientation is only correct when holding an iPad in portrait view. When holding iPad horizontally, in landscape view, Ooma's app remains oriented in the other position. There are a few other quirky things about the app I don't like as well, but if Ooma were to fix these problems, I would consider their app to be good. Until then, at least for iPad and iOS 10, I can only say the app is useable, but difficult."")";"2017-07-31T21:04:25-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1074074904&type=Purple%20Software";"1074074904";194;"en";"POSITIVE"

The biggest con I have found is that the app will mute the audio even when you have the phone in “silent mode” (flipped the switch on the side of the phone). I record streaming audio through the earphone jack, and even though I have notifications disabled for the app, and the silent switch ON, the app will still MUTE the audio while a call would be ringing, ruining my recording. It also bugs me about notifications being turned off, every time I open the app.
When an incoming call is received in silent mode, the app should only VIBRATE the phone, NOT MUTE THE AUDIO! Please fix this!

Also, even after the cutoff date for Caller ID verification, I am still receiving 3-ring calls from fraudsters! OOMA should have fixed this by now, and appears to be in violation of the new FCC standards in NOT blocking all spam/fraud calls.";"2021-07-08T17:24:39-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1074074904&type=Purple%20Software";"1074074904";167;"en";"NEGATIVE"

I have kept Ooma because I can use either of the two phone numbers for online sign ups so my cell phone does not constantly ring with spam all day. I keep my Ooma Telo on “Do Not Disturb” so it can only receive voicemails if someone leaves one and doesn’t ring constantly during the day.

After moving from the USA to New Zealand nearly a year ago I looked at several options for international calling plans including other Internet-based services. I was skeptical initially about Ooma but two of my friends highly recommended it. I’m glad that I listened to them. 

Choosing a phone number from the locale in the USA where I have most of my contacts has allowed simple dialing and I have used Ooma exclusively for international calls now for eight months. Since calls are placed using a local USA number it is very easy for people to return calls without any special dialing. There are no international charges or fees, and the quality of the calls are crystalline (at least as clear as when I’m in the USA using the local phone service there) with no calls being dropped. 

I do all of my calls off the Ooma app on an iPhone which works perfectly using either Wi-Fi or data on my local cell plan. Compared to other proprietary apps this one uses battery storage sparingly, so extended calls for business or to friends doesn’t flatten the battery. This app has made it convenient to use this service just like another line on my phone; the phone rings with a different chime letting me know it’s an Ooma call, I touch the screen to accept the call and I’m speaking to someone on the other side of the world just like they were next door. The value for the cost of the service is tremendous. 

I’m a very picky, skeptical person and Ooma has provided service well beyond my expectations.";"2018-02-16T11:27:47-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1074074904&type=Purple%20Software";"1074074904";292;"en";"POSITIVE"

– Voice quality can be fantastic and almost always is very good.
– I can use this to make a call from my home number even if my wife is on the home phone
– I can now use my cell phone to make calls even when I don't have any cell phone service!
– Really good spam blocking is part of the Ooma premier level of service.

Cons:
– Cannot mark calls as spam while in the call  Must open the web site in a browser, login, and then go through the steps of marking a call as spam so it is blocked.
– iPhone contacts are handled differently then contacts in your Oma directory. So if I am calling AAA, I can dial 11 and I will see a list of all my all my contacts whose name begins with A, B or C; and has A, B or C as the second letter, and then tap to call the one that I want. However the iPhone contacts are not integrated into that list. iPhone contacts are accessible via button, but Ooma contacts do not appear in that list.
– The app is as basic as it gets and does as little as they can get away with i.e. cannot change volume, change ringtone, and does not change orientation when the phone changes orientation.";"2017-02-17T15:56:18-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1074074904&type=Purple%20Software";"1074074904";227;"en";"NEGATIVE"

It provides voicemail access which is nice, as well as basic features that will fit the needs of casual users.

There really should be a way to add a caller to your blacklist directly from the mobile app. It's okay to do it from the browser interface, but would be *much* more convenient from the app.

Also, while Ooma premier service allows you to create multiple phone #'s, only incoming calls to your primary number will ring the app. This is a fairly major limitation for a mobile solution IMHO. The option does exist to simply forward calls to another number, such as your cell #, but with this method you can't distinguish direct incoming calls from those forwarded by Ooma service.

It would also be great to see Telo Status reported from within the app, especially those times when traveling or away from home.

I cancelled my account today due to the fact that I had less than 1 wk of ""usable service"" since receiving my device 45 days ago.

I used the Ooma app exclusively for calls, and there wasn't a day where I would say it ""worked"" without me logging some form of ticket.  Some days I didn't have service for over 20 minutes, other times I would be without service for days. Without me changing anything, the Teleo logo would light blue, the next morning it would be red (no service), then would be blue again two or three days later.  

When my Teleo was down (I even unplugged it once to test), the web dashboard said service was ""all green"" and I had to explain to the technician that that was ""highly improbable as I'm holding the power cord in my hand"".

No technical staff would ever listen to or attempt to diagnose the issue, and I was constantly told that the issues were my ISP.  I calculated speed tests and ping tests and backbone traces, nothing I showed them ever received anything other than ""perform a slow reboot"" from support (when they were available, there isn't 24x7 support).

It wasn't until I called in today to cancel my account that they got really serious about trying to discuss fixing things and started making free offers to me.  They wanted to send me a new Teleo device claiming that would fix everything even after I explained that I wasn't using the Teleo device AT ALL for my calls.

•  Tap the ⓘ to the far right of the call on the ‘Recents’ page
•  Tap the <— at the top right to go back to the ‘Recents’ page
• Then tap the ‘Voicemail’ icon at bottom
*  This usually will clear the ‘Missed Calls’ indicator - if it doesn’t repeat the process.

I have a couple of main complaints about the company.  The app is slowly getting better, but doesn’t really match their website yet.  My two issues are that the company doesn’t seem to listen to people who post issues or recommendations on their Forum site.  I’ve reported several issues and have never received a company response.  And I’ve seen many others equally ignored.

The other issue is that I greatly regret buying their Ooma branded home phones.  The Telo is fine, the Lynx works pretty good, but the three handsets I bought are buggy, poor quality sound and frequent ‘updates’ shuts down your entire phone system until all phones are updated (1 - 1.5 hours each time).  You have no control when this happens.  And when people call me the system drops the call a few seconds after I answer, making it seem like I am purposely hanging up on people.   Reported this and other things on their Forums, no response ...

Prior review:
Though I have not used this app much since recently downloading it (though I plan to use it more) I can say that over the years I have had this VOIP service I have been very pleased with it.  I do think that Ooma was a little slow in adding features at first, I have been happy with its evolution.  My original Ooma Hub has been in service all these years with only one service failure that I recall.  Though it was the service, not the Hub that experienced the service gap (less than one day of downtime as I recall).  I have now replaced the dependable Hub with a new Telo (and Telo Linx).   No company or service is perfect, but my experience with Ooma has been a positive one and though somewhat skeptical at first whether the startup Ooma company would survive I am glad they have done so.  I also like the integration with my Amazon Echo (and look forward to some feature enhancements with both devices).  Also, I, like many, would like to see an iPad version.  It's been far too long coming.  Having a phone version only is amateurish.";"2019-01-08T20:00:49-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1074074904&type=Purple%20Software";"1074074904";375;"en";"POSITIVE"

I have used it to make a couple of quick calls when I didn't feel like grabbing an Ooma connected handset. It works well for that function. 

I do have an issue with the IOS app continuing to ring long after the directly connected Ooma handset or linked number device (my cellphone) has picked the call. One day, I found the iPhone had been ringing for hours after I completed an incoming Ooma call routed to my cellphone. I also have to rush to my browser iPhone to stop it from ringing if I pick up a call on the Ooma connected handset. From the Ooma forums, I see this has been a problem since at least 2015! I know there have been updates to the IOS app since then and it is still occurring.
