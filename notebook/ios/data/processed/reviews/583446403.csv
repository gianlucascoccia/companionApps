I had an Apple watch for a minute and quickly discovered that it couldn‚Äôt do what my garmin did, so the Apple Watch went back and the Venu sq was purchased. Still trying to decide if i love the Venu Sq, as the Forerunner was so much simpler to use, but the Venu provides so much data that i love, like stress tracking, O2, etc. 
I really wish the Venu had more exercise options like HIIT or ‚Äúfunctional‚Äùstrength training. The strength training option from Garmin is frustrating with the reps, just simply time my workout. 
I wish setting up my walk/run intervals while running was simpler than going into another menu. Why isn‚Äôt that option there when i go into run? I can‚Äôt seem to figure out how to pause a run. Does it auto pause? What happens when i have to wait at a traffic light? 
Can i scroll through my text messages. Some just show half a message. Why can‚Äôt i scroll down? The watch just isn‚Äôt very intuitive. I‚Äôll keep reading the manual, but i think improvements could be made. If there wasn‚Äôt so much other data that i like, i would be tempted to go back to my Forerunner. ü§î";"2021-01-08T18:50:42-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=583446403&type=Purple%20Software";"583446403";215;"en";"POSITIVE"

It is so useful. It is lightweight, tells you your heartbeat, your VO2 max, recovery time, your aerobic training, and more. I didn‚Äôt realize all of the features I wanted were on the watch (there is no swimming, but I don‚Äôt really care). The app is what makes the watch so cool, and it makes it easy to see your mileage. Also, there are badges that you can get, and it makes the workouts feel like a game sometimes, trying to earn the badges. My mom now really wants one of these watches. I guess the downsides are that the watch dies after around three days, with you recording a workout session in all three days that last for around an hour. I don‚Äôt know how accurate the Garmin watch is, but I‚Äôm just glad that the features are there, because if I wanted more accuracy I would need to go and make myself uncomfortable for the day (heart rate while sleeping, deep and light sleep tracker, heart rate while running, etc). Sometimes it‚Äôs uncomfortable after wearing the watch snug for a couple of days. The ‚Äúmove!‚Äù Thing on the watch is a little annoying, but the pros outweigh the cons by far, and you even might be able to disable it. 

All in all, this is a great brand, and if you are obsessed with health and working out, I would recommend this brand for a lot of people.

I‚Äôve ran with it each day for 3 weeks and have also done kayaking and biking. I have only needed to recharge it twice, and the only negative has been a slight lack of tracking under even a few trees.

As for the app, I would give it 4.5 starts if I could, but have given the benefit of the doubt. All in all it provides very useful information about your performance and overall health, but is slightly lacking in User Interface as opposed to other activity apps. The graphs are often annoying because I have not found out how to choose a point on the graph to see a value, you can only see the trend roughly plotted and guess (this goes for paces from your runs and also things like your heart rate throughout the night). I also find the calendar view largely useless, especially when compared to something like Apple‚Äôs activity rings. Don‚Äôt get me wrong though, the data Garmin provides is second to none, but largely a function of which watch you have purchased.

In summary, Garmin provides as accurate and useful of info as any company does in the sports watch realm, but could stand to improve accessibility and aesthetics for some of that data in the app.";"2020-07-02T07:08:17-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=583446403&type=Purple%20Software";"583446403";226;"en";"POSITIVE"

HOWEVER: the Garmin Connect app seems to be getting more disappointing to use as a training tool with each revision. The prevailing style seems to prioritize oversimplified infographics over actually allowing users to review and interact with their data. As an example, I‚Äôve been religiously using ‚Äútraining status‚Äù every day for two years to monitor the relationship between my 7-day training load and my target load (based on integrated firstbeat tables), making training adjustments on the fly... Now, when I open the app, all those brilliantly helpful, adjustable, overlaid charts are gone‚Äîthey have literally been replaced by a colored icon that says, ‚ÄúProductive.‚Äù That icon changes in response to training each day, but I can no longer view the data that underlies it on the fly, rendering this potentially valuable source of insight meaningless within the app.

The watch and app is an upgrade compared to Polar, however I wish there were more options to customize things. Like being able to create certain activities (or change the names of the provided activities), or adding additional bed and awake times (I have different wake times on days off), or being able to record and separate naps from overnight sleep and have that data compute to your sleep score. Supposedly, according to the Garmin website, the sleep and wake times that you key in are fixed in that even if you take a nap any recorded data would be in ADDITION to what was computed overnight. Wrong. I took a 2+ hour nap and the data OVERWROTE my overnight sleep. Which is very frustrating when the data is being used for tracking purposes. Aside from that, I find the app is very limited in its ability to customize or tailor to personal preferences. Perhaps I am just unfamiliar with Connect but I do not want to have to download all or any of the the other Garmin apps JUST to be able to get one or two things to my liking.

I would also like to see the ability to gain the same badge multiple times. And at the end of the activity show you new badges as well as your new total of badges of which you have more than one. Annoying to only get them once. Okay cool you ran 10 miles here‚Äôs a badge. It would be satisfying and motivational to be able to accrue multiples of some of these. I imagine a lot of people would strive to collect a benchmark 100 5ks or something. Just some things i hope the developers consider. 

After being suspicious of some of the pace times the display has been showing me, I decided to run 3 miles on a track at an even pace.

Second are the charts that are messed up when going in my run details. Might as well forget trying to look at pace chart.

For instance I may do a run and the slowest I go is 8 minutes a mile but since they pull the chart down to 30 minutes a mile you can really tell anything about your pace. 

The other thing they need to do better on is making it more sociable.

I also use it for connecting to my vivosmart watch/ HR monitor. Works pretty seamlessly for tracking sleep, steps, activities, etc.  
I use a Garmin index scale to track my weight, body fat %, hydration ,etc. and it works well to keep all that data together. 
I use a different app (MyPlate) to track calories, and for some reason it doubles whatever I‚Äôve burned. Typically, if I ride and burn 2000 calories, GC will tell my iPhone health app that I‚Äôve burned 4000, even though it‚Äôs showing 2000 in GC.

I never realized what I was missing until I upgraded from a FitBit Blaze to Garmin!  GPS tracking is on point on the watch & app, training stats are amazing to see where & when I need to adjust intensity & history is great to see how I‚Äôve improved with better tracking abilities from Garmin.  
Yes, there are some glitches, but nothing to cry or scream about: pretty much everything tracks, monitors & gives guidance where needed.  It‚Äôs great to pull up stats after a long run to see if VO2 Max is improving, cadence, HR Zones & pace (for those coveted negative splits!) & see how my cross training improves my running.  
The only down side is sleep doesn‚Äôt seem as accurate - it‚Äôs shown me asleep when I was watching a movie, but I‚Äôm more concerned with the other athletic stats so as long as I‚Äôm scraping 6+ hours of sleep I know everything else flows well.
I was using MyFitnessPal to track calories consumed which it synced 99% of the time accurately which was nice to see the calories burned/consumed stats.  I don‚Äôt track there much anymore unless I‚Äôm in serious training or trying something new to see how it may affect me but things usually flow between the apps well.

1. Allow users to customize sleep hours! My goal is 7 hours but Garmin doesn‚Äôt allow this setting to be modified! You only have 8 as an option I tend to never make this goal which throws off my daily card showing that I made all of my goals! My health and fitness team recommends 6-9 hours I‚Äôm not certain if this is a general health standard but Garmin should at least allow us to set it within this range!

2. The watch menus ‚Äúin the app‚Äù -can use a overhaul ‚ÄúActivities,Apps and More‚Äù should be collapsed as a single section which includes ‚Äúdata fields‚Äù and ‚Äúwidgets‚Äù currently they fall under appearance! I get it Garmin is trying to make it simpler for non-technical users however, I think with less menus and more grouping it would improve workflow! Btw, it used to be this way they changed it some time a go!

3. The App Store needs to be more integrated! It seems that Garmin should let the app include apps from the AppStore without launching a browser within the app! I would suggest putting the App Store directly below the watch on the main menu, allow the api to talk directly to the store and have it better embedded into the app!

For starters, I should do nothing on the watch itself. Things like adding music, entering Wi-Fi passwords, changing the watch-face: all of that should be done in the app, on your phone, not on the watch. Or at least have the option of doing it on your phone. Manually entering a Wi-Fi password on a watch with 2 buttons when I have a literal computer inches away from it with a full keyboard is what an insane person would recommend as a user experience. 

Adding some music to the watch is a clunky experience that something like the Apple Watch does seamlessly.

Just a suggestion- under activities when you look at what you've done under any of the activities it uses the ""last"" 7 days, 4 weeks, or 12 months. Why not break it down just by a set Monday-Sunday week for the 7 days, an actual month for the 4 weeks, and an actual year for the 12 months.

Heart rate monitor is just ok, but that is the nature of those which sit on top of wrist. Message alert is handy. Reliability and durability are problems as I have had to replace it every 12 months or so (3rd device so far) due to failure of display or broken band. 
The app is ok. It lacks ability to partner with another user to see how they are doing and truly inspire/compete/motivate one another.

The app tracks a potentially overwhelming amount of fitness data. I had to fiddle with it for awhile before I got it customized to show what‚Äôs important to me. However, I am NOT a tech savvy person, so if I can figure it out, I‚Äôm sure anyone can. 

One thing I‚Äôd like to see added has to do with the ability to add gear to activities. Most of my hiking is done with a backpack and I‚Äôd love to be able to log how much weight I carry on each hike. Right now I can add a backpack as ‚Äúother‚Äù gear, but all it tracks is that gear‚Äôs mileage. Logging mileage on a backpack doesn‚Äôt seem that useful. 

Another issue I think has to do with my Garmin Instinct rather than the app. When doing a hiking activity, the heart rate recorded is substantially lower than what it should be. I‚Äôve done significant climbs when I can feel my heart trying to beat out of my chest, but my watch says I‚Äôm at a nice, easy 80 bpm.

The vivofit has more activity tracking capabilities and I expected it would be more accurate on runs. 
Right from the start I found I couldn‚Äôt sync the watch to the app because the battery would be drained within 2 days. Not impressed by that at all. 

What has been my recent struggle is the heart rate accuracy when I track a cardio activity‚Äîthis seems to be the best mode to put it in when I do weights. 
Some days it seems to be somewhat accurate in tracking my heart rate. More frequently my heart is pounding, I‚Äôm out of breath and this dumb thing says my heart rate is barely 80. This in turn means my calories burned is inaccurate. Of course I sync my watch while I‚Äôm working out. I find when my heart rate isn‚Äôt being tracked closing the app and reopening helps sometimes. But more often than not it doesn‚Äôt. This is extremely frustrating. 

The app is sluggish at best. I do find it Interesting that when I run it tracks my heart rate fine. So maybe it‚Äôs anaerobic activity it struggles with. But if it claims to have the capability to track an activity it should work‚Äîespecially for the money.

1) the app is only made for an iPhone and as a result it will not work in landscape mode on an iPad.  It would be sensible to have the ipad support where graphs and data could be displayed more clearly.

2) the gui on the iPhone/iPad is really not intuitive.  You have to scroll around to figure out where the 'connect/upload' button is.  A user interface for a device like this should have a simple 'upload' as the first menu item as this is what most people do.  The graphs and stats should all be laid out logically.  Like a simple window that has 1. Health data, 2. Sports data and the sub catabolise under there such as health->graphs, health->averages. 3. Watch screens

3) the most important data should always be displayed on the first screen.  Ie calories burned, steps taken, avg HR, max/min HR, resting HR. Miles run, etc

I know there is a lot of data but just adding a mess of screens makes it very hard to navigate and I am incredibly computer literate.

2) Another bug, if I load a course into the watch for a run it never starts LiveTrack automatically. I have to open the app and then as it‚Äôs syncing with the watch it realizes there is a workout in progress and starts the LiveTrack at that point on its own. 
3)The voice prompts (which I love) only seem to work if I open the Garmin app before a workout and leave it open. Kinda silly and annoying. Maybe fix this too if you have time.

It constantly crashes, never syncs with your watch, and you data that you manually enter is never saved. Which, given a lot of the target audience is typically not in places where there‚Äôs a constant connection, that‚Äôs an issue. (Outdoors in the wilderness, overseas, etc.) That‚Äôs the first thing.

The next is, I do not understand where the app gets its estimations, but running a mile does not burn 6000 calories. When you manually enter activities, it comes up with the outlandish calculations which by the way, overwrite your data if you try to fix it. The software needs to be fixed. 

Lastly, when I do have a connection, the app will use phone parameters to overwrite the settings I have set on the watch I use (Tactic Charlie). So when I set barometric pressures and altimeter settings manually based off of local reporting, somehow, whatever weather data my phone is receiving, overwrites what I manually input. That‚Äôs an issue if you‚Äôre actually using the watch for navigation...which it‚Äôs a GPS watch after all.

Wishlist:
I wish there was more of a way to tell the app you are about to go into a yoga class and it would pick up the movements, as the app is you have to enter every position (which the list of positions is not user friendly and incomplete) and then you have to list a time for each position or else the data won‚Äôt save, if I could have one wish, it would be a ‚Äúreorganizing‚Äù to the yoga part of the app.

1) More Activity Type options 
- Specifically, Boxing or Kickboxing are weirdly absent 

2) Automatic BPM/Heart Rate Data Sync for Manual Activity Entry
- When I enter an activity manually, high/low/avg BPM and other heart rates stats the device already tracks should automatically be filled in (assuming I‚Äôve input an activity start/stop time that can be used to pull the data). 
- A more advanced version of this might include the ability to see how that heart rate data changes for a given activity type over time)

3) Zoom In/Tap to See Data on the Heart Rate Details Page
- I should be able to tap a point on the map and see what the heart rate data is for that moment in time
- There should also be some sort of way to visually see start/STOP for an activity (and maybe even pull that activity data up on a tap)

Overall, great app! Just needs these crucial features.
