It's not optimized for the iPhone 6, crashes more frequently, sometimes is slow to receive new measurements from the scale, doesn't support the Share Sheet, etc. so I'm knocking off one star.*

The weighing scale itself is great, and the app is decent but needs some improvements. You can't update the scale's wifi settings without setting up the scale from scratch. The user interface could be enhanced to make it more user friendly.";"2015-08-05T08:55:13-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=588688639&type=Purple%20Software";"588688639";90;"en";"POSITIVE"

This app can be very useful, especially if you buy the Withings baby scale but this bug renders the entire app basically useless. I have given this feedback repeatedly for 3 months without a response, any updates nor any feedback that they are working on the issue. Knowing how many bottles or how many ounces your baby is drinking a day is important data. There are other apps that do this... Though it doesn't automatically record the weight, I have switched over to Similac baby journal as it keeps all the information I need all in 1 app. This is truly such a shame... Seems like a simple fix but does not appear to be of any concern. I love the Withings products... I use the pulse health mate, the adult scale, the baby scale & the baby monitor. This app is the only product of theirs that I am truly disappointed and I have given them plenty of opportunity to fix this prior to my post.";"2014-12-02T07:57:44-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=588688639&type=Purple%20Software";"588688639";189;"en";"POSITIVE"
