Probably one of THE MOST convenient and simple apps for free. Like another reviewer said instead of searching for the remote as long as you have your phone (which is most likely all the time) you‚Äôre good. As a wheelchair bound disabled person, some people in my home can leave the remote in places I can‚Äôt really reach so that‚Äôs were this app come in handy, and really in this household the remote generally has the tendency to disappear. So if you have a remote that has hidden legs and likes to go into hiding then the app is great. On a funny and more truthful note, I originally got the app because my sister and I weren‚Äôt getting along at the time and she knows every morning I use the tv. For some reason the next morning I couldn‚Äôt find the remote and had a gut feeling she hid it on purpose so that I had no choice but to talk and ask her where it was (in which she probably still wouldn‚Äôt have helped to be petty). To avoid needing her help, I downloaded the app and she looked confused and shocked like ‚Äúüò≥‚Äù.  I felt like victory with my phone remote üòéüòÇ.

My current issue is trying to figure out how to cancel subscriptions, and being unable to get into contact with anyone from Roku Anyone at all, is impossible. If I go to the site of what I‚Äôm subscribing to, it says I need to do it through Roku. When I go to Roku‚Äôs website, it says I need to do it through the Roku. I don‚Äôt see the option anywhere on the ruku, it‚Äôs not on the faq, their online ‚Äúhelp‚Äù system is worthless and just puts me through circles. And their customer service line that they hide the number to (bet you can‚Äôt find it on their website) just saying to go online for help. Which isn‚Äôt helpful at all. So I‚Äôm about to just call my credit card company and file a fraud claim, I don‚Äôt know how else to get the payments to stop. Another annoying issue from about a year ago. I bought the top model of Roku since my old rule stopped being serviced. The most expensive, fastest model. Within 2 months it‚Äôs telling me I need to buy a memory card since the Roku is full, and until I do, it uninstalls apps to make room for the ones I use. All I use is 5 streaming channels. That‚Äôs literally the only apps downloaded on it besides what comes in it, which shouldn‚Äôt be a lotl. If I‚Äôm buying the most expensive, top end model of a product, I shouldn‚Äôt have to buy additional add ones to make it functional.

By that I mean, 6 months into having my tv, the batteries inside the remote actually corroded and ate away the battery contacts inside. I cleaned the inside and replaced the batteries only for it to happen again 4 months later. I was using Kirkland signature batteries the second time. After the third time of cleaning out the remote I noticed certain buttons stopped working consistently, and eventually I had to switch to using the app.

The app itself is very useful though, I can do more on it that I could with the original remote. I love that I can just open the app on my phone and not worry about looking for the remote that fell behind my bed in my sleep again. However I have one complaint about the app itself, it doesn‚Äôt have a widget. I would absolutely love if I could put a widget on my home screen with 3 buttons, power on most recently used tv, open the remote buttons, and volume up + down.

That seems like such an oversight of something so essential in a remote app. Imagine you have a physical remote that sleeps and may or may not reload when you want to use it. Behold Roku app. Turning off auto-lock for the entire device just to keep the remote open is really a bad and unsafe alternative. Unfortunately with all the great features this app provides (especially the swipe controls and keyboard) this app becomes completely useless because eventually you will find yourself taking the path of least resistance and just reach for the physical remote. Please please add an auto-lock prevention option. IOS has this capability and from experience it‚Äôs relatively minimal effort to implement this functionality. Also Roku doesn‚Äôt seem to have an email to suggest missing features, so I‚Äôm going to be pessimistic here and assume Roku probably won‚Äôt read this and this app will never get this option.

The app, while the other features are cool, is designed to be A REMOTE. If it can‚Äôt even be used as a remote then YOU ARE FAILING AS DEVELOPERS OF THIS APP.

I installed it (super easy) and it worked for about 3 days then it started saying that the network is out of range, I don‚Äôt t get it! Where I have my router it‚Äôs not that far...
At first I thought it was the actual provider (Comcast) I tried doing all the troubleshooting.

All I really wanted was for my phone to act as a remote. I downloaded the free app and launched itturned it and immediately a screen popped up which had already searched for Roku debices registered to me. I was asked which device I wanted to use. I selected my living room device and immediately my phone turned into a remote fir that Roku box. I could choose other screens and see what was available to watch on premium channels, what was available on my channels, and a search button. If I only wanted a remote I wasn‚Äôt bothered with anything else. Simple. 

But the biggest surprise was, if I didn‚Äôt want to bother anyone else I could actually tap a key and every channel on my Roku was routed to my headset. This cyber key when tapped would immediately pair my Roku box with my Bluetooth headset. I could then walk around, turn up my headset, and chill, not having to worry about neighbors or anyone in my home who was asleep or didn‚Äôt want to be bothered.

Interface is appealing, the haptic response when pressing buttons makes sure of that. It performs effectively and does as is required by the tv as a regular remote would.

Thank you for contacting Roku customer support. I understand your mobile application crashes after an update on your iPhone.

If the physical remote controller is available, please follow the troubleshooting steps below:
Unplug the power cable from your Roku TV, wait for 30 seconds then reconnect the power cable firmly in your Roku TV
Perform a system update by navigating to Settings> System> System update> Check now
Uninstall and re-install the Roku mobile app from your mobile
If the issue persists, try installing in a different mobile

If you have additional questions, please reply to this email. We will be glad to further assist you.

The all black distraction free remote while watching a movie at night is thoughtful and worth mentioning.

The app needs a couple of enhancements though.
1) Haptic feedback when using buttons / trackpad on the remote.
2) Ability to switch between audio channel (connected headphones/ Bluetooth phones) from within the device while listening privately.
3) Lockscreen integration to pause, play, rewind and forward quickly.
4) Ability to reorder channels in the installed channels list.

OLD REVIEW:

Can only connect sporadically

I started using this app last year with my wired Roku, and all was golden. The app provides amazing search funcitonality, and being able to use your phone's keyboard instead of the onscreen keyboard is so much faster.

When I got a second wireless Roku, however, all was not well. It's simply unpredicable, in that its ability to connect is sporadic. I've tried everything I could think of (made sure phone and Roku are on the same network; reset the network on the Roku; reset phone settings; assigned a static IP via my router). Nothing has helped. 

So, for my wireless Roku, this app is non-functional 9 out of 10 attempts.";"2019-06-04T11:30:02-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=482066631&type=Purple%20Software";"482066631";162;"en";"POSITIVE"

There is nothing but empty space where the rest of the navigation button used to be, so clearly there was absolutely no reason to shrink everything - and there are no settings to change it back.

Updated - The bug with the remote control is related to opening the app in landscape mode.  If you force quit, put the IPad in portrait mode and then open the Roku app, things work.   If you open in landscape and the Roku app switches to portrait while the Roku app is open then you will not be able to use the right half of the remote.

The Roku remote is worthless. If it slips down beside your leg and you move, you will be pressing buttons. Thus, the remote is transmitting but not being picked up by the Roku device therefore there‚Äôs no change on your TV, but the device is draining the battery. Shame on Roku for not designing a remote that would time out after 3 to 5 seconds of holding any button on the remote. That would avoid unnecessary transmitting of the remote being blocked by cushions, and the battery is being drained. I have spent over $100 a year replacing the batteries in the remote and as of today, the  ROOKED-U is going in the garbage.

 However, since the update, the remote in the app hasn‚Äôt been working consistently. It just tells me I need WiFi. Sadly, my WiFi is connected and the app itself even tells me it‚Äôs connected to this room when I open it.
Closing and re-opening the app works sometimes. But I‚Äôll probably just try other devices to stream content until it‚Äôs fixed and works consistently.
Once it‚Äôs fixed, it‚Äôs a great app to use.";"2019-01-29T16:38:51-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=482066631&type=Purple%20Software";"482066631";101;"en";"POSITIVE"

I‚Äôve used this app for almost 3 years and was great. Now, it NEVER consistently stays connected to my Roku. Remotes are very often used to suddenly pause, or ffwd or rewind. When I finally connect, By the time I get the blasted thing to finally connect and respond, I‚Äôve gone too far forward or reverse! So that means that it‚Äôs losing connection not only while the phone is at rest, but also during mid use! Get it together, Roku! 5 stars to 3 for me!

Contact your Internet provider and change the wireless channel to 161 if you are connected on a 5GHz network or choose 11 if the frequency is 2.4GHz.
Keep in mind all my other audio/visual apps work fine without going into the weeds like that.
