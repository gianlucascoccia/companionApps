1;3909602560;"AndrewAppel";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id195848074";"1.6";1;"Amazing product, horrible app (use HomeKit)";"First off, I want to say this is an amazing product overall - the rating I gave is directly tethered to the app itself. Not the hardware or experience when you get it working.

The app will NOT let you convert your device to HomeKit - despite it having the feature to do so.

The app is horribly laid out, and very confusing. Even more so when you compare to the simplicity of the Apple HomeKit interface.

If you add the device with this app first but intend to use HomeKit, prepare to lose at least 20 minutes, as you will need to perform a factory reset on the bridge & button(s) to set it back up in HomeKit.

Lastly, if you add directly through HomeKit while on your 2.4GHz band of your network - it will be painless and work perfectly. I cannot stress enough how great the end result is - you get to control any HomeKit device by the touch of a button. You can add as many as you like as well, just be sure not to use this app - use HomeKit and if you add a button, simply tap the Birdge’s button and then your add-on button and it will automatically appear in the Apple Home app.

Great product - horrible app.";"2019-03-21T15:23:15-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1072053240&type=Purple%20Software";"1072053240";218;"en";"POSITIVE"

The first issue is that the color scheme doesn’t match colors from Hue. You can set the color to blue and the color will actually be a bluish white. You can then go into the Hue app and turn it a deeper blue. Logitech needs to update this.

The apps doesn’t have iPhone X support. 

A bit of a pain in the butt to set up. I had to restart my phone, the hub, and the router in order to get it to work.

You guys should have an outlet on the bridge so an outlet is not totally taken up.";"2018-03-12T17:57:54-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1072053240&type=Purple%20Software";"1072053240";112;"en";"NEGATIVE"
