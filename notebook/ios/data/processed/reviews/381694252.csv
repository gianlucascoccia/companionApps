The app has some UX issues, especially around joining networks where if you pick a different network than the default it will not give you the chance to name the speaker. If you accidentally swipe down during setup it will dismiss the setup screen and leave you in limbo. But the biggest issue is that today I changed my network password and reset the speaker to set it up again. It gets to the part where it asks you for your country and then the app crashes. This leaves the speaker not set up. I reset it and tried again, same result. This might be because of the new iOS update. Hopefully Naim will fix the app soon! The hardware itself is amazing, but it’s a paperweight until they fix the app. I can’t even stream to it.";"2019-11-10T18:33:01-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=381694252&type=Purple%20Software";"381694252";157;"en";"POSITIVE"

I even have 2 networks and have tried it with both.  Same thing.  I get so far on the app and then nothing.  My WiFi is Google Fiber and is extremely fast, so pretty sure it’s not the WiFi.  I have now spent almost a day on it.  I am so frustrated that I am returning it for a refund.  A simple WiFi connection has to be this convoluted?  I have never in 30 years had this issue with any other program or product.  How tough can this be?  A lot of other companies have this down to a science.

The WiFi is fine.  It worked flawlessly on the Devialet unit it was replacing and every thing else that is connected it it, except the Naim.

I’ve since realized the song option I talk about below either has been fixed, or it’s an option that has been added. Either way, thank you Naim for addressing me personally and answering my query. I’ve raised my review to three stars.
Also, I’ve had a lot less issues than before, I’m assuming glitches have been worked on and for that I also thank you.
I’ve noticed that just like a computer, most issues go away when you unplug it and plug it back in.

So why not more than three stars? Because it’s still not as smooth as using the Tidal app directly. Of course I don’t use the tidal app directly because I don’t want to lose sound quality through Bluetooth.

(Previous review)
It’s a constant struggle to get Tidal and Naim to work harmoniously. The latest issue is that it will say, “ready” except it will not play whatever you choose. Also. Naim, if I click on a song and nothing is playing, it means I want that song to play. Why does it open a drop down every time to see if I want to play it next or queue it. I have a $10,000 music room setup (and I know it’s low compared to other Naim equipment owners) and I can’t even stream one song without having issues. It’s embarrassing!
I currently use this app on my iPhone and I have a Naim Atom.
Issues not as bad with the Muso.

Update: the new release is generally a lot better. Seems to be a little more stable for qobuz , and now able to add to and create new playlists from the naim app, which was badly needed. Now if they would fix Chromecast integration, specifically with pandora. I think the update made that worse.  Airplay works perfectly all the time, but sound not as good as Chromecast. So I moved the rating up to 3 stars. Fix Chromecast and I will give it 5 stars.

I repeatedly have issues with the app finding my room on my Unitiqute2. I've had to delete the Naim app and reisntall on my iPhone 6+ running the most recent versions of iOS, and the app maintains no consistency no matter how many times I shut down the system, iPhone, network, and reinstall the app.  The worst thing is that the app, if it were workking, is so much beter than trying to use the remote that came with the unit, as you cannot see your library or control the unit nearly as well. So, without an app that is an interface to the Naim streaming product, the product is crap. I've given up and will be selling off the Naim product as they appear to be clueless as a company. To the other reviewers comments, I too have found no assistance from Naim customer support, which is an oxymoron. They are unresponsive. Aurender has a better product that has this figured out. Perhaps these old line audio companiues cannot truly manage in the digital age despite the effort to put out a line of streamers, as without an interface, its not worth it.";"2017-02-20T13:35:42-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=381694252&type=Purple%20Software";"381694252";214;"en";"NEGATIVE"

I find I tend to turn on my music or access Internet Radio much more than I used to because I can whip out my iPhone or pick up the iPad and do it from any room.  So I'm listening to music a lot more than I did.  

On the negative side, the volume control could be a little larger, particularly on the iPad where there's plenty of space.  It seems to disconnect from the network to easily and the user interface could be better.  If you go to Artists you then get a listing of all of that artist's songs rather than a list of albums with an option for ""all songs"".  Refreshing the names of a UPnP server takes too long.  I can't see album covers over UPnP either.  Also, if you have put the phone aside and suddenly need to do something like killing the volume to answer a phone call you can't do it.

It seems like they made an update not too long ago, we got this about a month ago and are very happy. Works perfectly for waking up, turning on and off, adjusting everything I want, and is great with the added internet radio stations including ones that are 320!

Using Spotify is perfection with it- use the Spotify app on your preferred device to select, but takes control in the unit.  This means you’re not streaming with your phone or tablet, but the actual box.  Tidal works as well but not as good. For our system, we don’t see a quality difference between tidal and Spotify, it may be our market, quality of speakers, or room, so that all works for us.  

As far as some additions, it would be great to have more easily connected devices like Alexa, so I can easily make commands like “computer, play music on Spotify” and it does an action I want. Also tweaking different balancing, or being able to tweak the sound in each speaker volume, or connecting extra Bluetooth devices for a sort of “party mode” would also be great.";"2021-02-05T12:25:41-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=381694252&type=Purple%20Software";"381694252";210;"en";"POSITIVE"

I’m not an engineer, but I shouldn’t have to be one to use this system.
