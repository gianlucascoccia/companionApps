The app works well for setting up routines, picking a specific color and setting the brightness. The music controller needs work though. 1.) The volume starts out high and quickly drops.

The app only controls the brightness of the lights to the volume of the beat. Color changes every few seconds. Color should change to a pitch change instead.  Also strobe mode should be added.

First a lot of the songs simply won't play, instead I get an error talking about a music format problem, whatever that means.  Second, when I do get a song to play, a lot of times the lights flash once, then stay off.  Changing the musical style at the bottom seems to help sometimes, for instance by changing from normal to jazz.  But don't pick Rock, because the lights stay off.

Also, are you supposed to be able to control lights remotely from your phone?  Or only when you are on your wi-fi network?

1. Let 3rd party apps like spotify connect with the app to play music not on your iPod 

2. Let us get to the home button while music and lights play

3. Make a hip hop option instead of jazz! 

4. Actually update the music with the lights for once!";"2014-11-25T10:15:19-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=595148649&type=Purple%20Software";"595148649";61;"en";"POSITIVE"
