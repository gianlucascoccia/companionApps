Hardware works well. But app is definitely due for some very simple updates. Like allowing more than one person to receive notifications. Also custom notifications if the garage door is left open. Maybe the ability to send a one time access pass to people without them having to sign up and download the app. Many possibilities.

In terms of bugs, the most glaring one that I've seen is that if you've changed your account password on the web admin page, the app would stop working and complain that the password was wrong. However, there is no way that I could see to change the password that the app uses to log in. To resolve this, I had to delete and re-add the device. From there, I noticed that if you don't put in the device ID, the validation logic for that field says that you've entered in a device ID that was over twenty characters long. 

As for UI improvements, there are numerous (but then again, I'm a UX snob). For one, why do I need to go look up my device ID when I'm trying to log into my account? It should just be recorded as part of it. Next, with respect to opening and closing doors, there's this kludgey element where you swipe left/right and up/down to activate the action.

Either HomeKit support (preferred) since you no longer need hardware to make that happen it could be added via a firmware update.

At least Siri shortcuts support so you unlock your garage/gate with just your voice in the car rather than having to open an app. 

Also the interface is a little ugly and gimmicky. Why not just have a list of gates/doors and an open button. Next to each. No need for each one to take up the whole screen. And why swipe up and down? Just make it a friggin button!
