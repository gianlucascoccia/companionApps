About 3 months ago the app inexplicably lost connection; tech support’s response was to ask me to send them a video of me going through the steps. It’s a little hard to do since the camera is part of the phone that has the app but I suppose I could ask someone to do the recording. 
But that’s besides the point. That’s not a viable solution, it’s taking a pass. I’ve followed the instructions repeatedly and I’ve gotten nowhere; the app fails to connect, never progressing beyond 0% even after 20 minutes of processing. There’s no alternate way to troubleshoot, and I’m just expected to repeat the process ad nauseum, which I believe I’ve reached. I’m done. It’s a shame, the device is poorly supported but when it works it’s great. I guess it’s time to try a different product.";"2021-12-16T23:57:05-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=977125608&type=Purple%20Software";"977125608";169;"en";"POSITIVE"

A year ago these lights worked extremely well with Lumia. It was very responsive and worked flawlessly. Then they released an update that first broke Lan control and then after they so called “fixed” it, the lights barely stay connected and most of the time don’t even respond with Lumia. I’ve already sold almost every bulb that I could so far.

I raised my concerns thinking it was Lumia's fault for a while until they came back and told me it’s Yeelight and they’re not even responding. Yeelight, you should support the apps that support you. It makes you and the brands look bad when the users are the ones taking the hit

I finally figured out how to create a customized dimming scene but it took more investigating than it should have. The interface could be more user-friendly, such as placing customized scenes and programs next to the preset ones that come with the app. Or the ability to modify or delete preset scenes that you don’t like.

Just, on its own. Immediately on launch. Creepy as all get out. Deleting this application immediately, and getting a new light bulb. DO NOT INSTALL.

(N.B. The app developer has responded to comments regarding this claiming it is an issue related to sharing custom lighting. To be clear, Yeelight isn’t copying something ON TO my clipboard, as it would need to do for me to share something. It is PASTING the CONTENTS OF MY CLIPBOARD, from safari, including say, if I had copied a one time password in order to paste it, or an address or phone number, and doing who-knows-what with the information it is taking. There is no good excuse for doing this.

5;6567569866;"joshvickerson";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id161836616";"3.3.29";1;"Unreliable";"The app is extremely unreliable. It crashes frequently, particularly during device setup which makes configuring lights unbearable. It can eventually setup most devices, but it will take many tries.

iOS also tends to intercept the setup and offers to setup HomeKit devices directly in HomeKit, which usually works well. Yeelight will then prompt to add devices from HomeKit, but this always fails. The result is some lights can only be controlled via HomeKit and often get colors wrong when set to dim.

Overall, the app is somewhat required and does eventually work. But it’s so unreliable it’s hard to give this a decent rating.

Update: downgrading from 2 stars to 1 star because after multiple updates of “bug fixes” since my last review, the app is still just an unreliable. Setup of new devices is still awful. I have a light bulb that desperately needs a firmware update, but the app never successfully installs it. Overall I’m incredibly frustrated and don’t plan on buying or recommending any more Yeelight products until these issues are resolved.";"2020-10-23T20:31:53-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=977125608&type=Purple%20Software";"977125608";175;"en";"NEGATIVE"

The Yeelight app breaks UI standards throughout its interface. Worse, though are the bugs. If I set up a “flow” and save it as a “favorite,” and then set up a second flow with different parameters and also favorite it, the app obliterates the settings for the first flow I saved. Every time. There is no user-friendly error handling that I see; the app just resets all the flow parameters and the favorite becomes a static one-color choice. 

It’s clear that the app developer(s) don’t have a good grasp of iOS/iPadOS guidelines (or good UX principles in general), nor are they fluent in English (not a bad thing in-and-of-itself, but at least spend the money to have the UI text localized correctly if you’re less than fluent).

Everything takes one or two too many taps; I still find myself accidentally tapping “room” when what I want to do is in the “device” menu; it’s easier to switch on the novelty light modes (which are cute but which you won’t use more than once, at most) than your pre-programmed ones. 
Also occasionally the app just logs you out, and logging back in requires you to remember the user info for your Xiaomi account. If you need to reset your password, prepare for a frustrating chain of CAPTCHA codes and emails that you may or may not receive in time to enter the reset code. 
I would love to find an alternative to the Yeelight app. The hardware is great and I recommend it wholeheartedly.

3/28/20 Alright guys... what’s going on here? There’s an ad in the app every time it opens, so you really think that is acceptable for whenever someone wants to turn off/on/change a light? Can you imagine walking into a room and hitting the light switch and then having to wait for an ad play to finish before the lights come on? Come on guys you have a great product that is being ruined by your remote control app. Removing stars until fixed. 

For those of you new to the app once you get it working DON’T update the app, it seems they don’t beta test new versions and end up crashing your system. Once you get them working, get them installed to HomeKit. It’s less customization and needs to be on WiFi but it’s currently more reliable. 
___________________________________
*Update* 
12/1/19 Version 3.3.03 restored function to everything. Firmware update on bulbs was finally able to install as well after app updated. Seems to be back to normal. Apple home integration working properly.
___________________________________
Newest version of app 11/7/19 scenes functional again but nothing else works, still shows offline, won’t add to Apple home. Can we just get the last version of the app back??
————————————————

Had these about a year, the lights work great and are quick and responsive. The app has come a long way as well most notably the HomeKit functionality. It is a little slow to open on older devices. Updated the app to most recent and now all my lights show offline, still work fine in Apple home.

1: the app fails to login with your correct username and password. Even more when requesting to reset my password, the reset link is never sent to my email. And yes, I did check my spam. 

2: After an app update, the preset light settings such as Reading, Birthday, or Romance we’re removed. Such presets were convenient because I didn’t have to configure my own light settings from the color palette.

3: Related to 1, I had to logon almost every time when I opened the app! Imagine using the Facebook app and having to login every time you b opened it. Horrible.

Bottom line: don’t buy this smart light because the app, which controls it, is simply uncontrollable. Yes this light is chapter than other smart lights, but you get what you pay for.

every time this happens i forget this is a thing and inevitably have to figure out which of my emails i used and then reset the password. it forces you to do a captcha and a code sent to your email or phone to change your password 

sometimes the reset doesn’t take, so after frustratingly trying to log in a few times with info you are 100% sure is correct bc you literally just set it, you just have to try to reset it again. but trying this more than 1 time in a row will get you the prompt “too many authentication requests please try again later”

it is a ****ing lightbulb. i just want to slightly change the awful sterile bluish white that is for some reason the factory default to a slightly warmer yellowish white. this shouldn’t be this hard. i shouldn’t even need to make an account. ITS A LIGHTBULB

honestly if it logged me out but just didn’t reset the bulb to factory settings, i wouldn’t ever know, care, or notice. i don’t use the color settings nearly as much as i thought i would. if it would just stay the color i set it to it would be fine
