Good descriptions on the coffee capsule choices. Easy to make and change selections, pay and be done. One downside though, was that the app awarded me 3 free sleeves of decaf intenso capsules at the bottom of my shopping basket (great!) while at the same time giving me a pop-up warning that decaf intenso is sold out (not great). It gave me no option to choose another type of capsule for the freebie (which I assume is a benefit of having bought as many sleeves as I did).  Freebie failure.  It left me feeling, somewhat irrationally, like I lost something as a result of my purchase. This is probably not a great way for an app to leave a customer feeling.  This seems like a fixable glitch in the app, adding the ability to catch when you're sold out of your freebie item and offer alternatives. 
Overall, though, I'll definitely use the app again when I don't have time to go to a Nespresso boutique.  Oh - one more suggestion: at checkout, include the option for users to request a capsule recycling mail-in bag.

One, I work at a five star-five diamond urban hotel and have access to fantastic traditionally made espresso on a daily basis. Two, Nespresso coffee is as good if not better than this espresso. Also, the milk frothing device that came with our Vertuo bundle is amazingly consistent at providing fantastic foamed milk. I know the amount of technique and patience it takes for an individual to master using a steam wand and IT IS NOT AN EASY technique to perform. So, that a machine can produce professional results with the touch of a button is the sign of some highly intellectual engineering; kudos on that. Lastly, for the app itself, its a joy to use. From remembering previous orders, keeping information secure, streamlining the ordering process and ease of use, and (admittedly not a result of the app, per se) the timeliness of the orders arriving is hands down some of the best customer service around. If you’re thinking about an upgrade from your single serve coffee machine, look no further. Also, beware when you travel from the comfort of your kitchen and are forced to drink lesser coffees again, as it will most likely be all the time.

I also have a machine without Bluetooth connectivity. My machines appear in the order I added them, not allowing me to rearrange their placement. I don’t need to see my non-Bluetooth machine, so I’d prefer to make it last in the list. Instead I have to swipe past it to get to my connected machine. It takes multiple taps & swipes to brew my drink though the app. With the Barista machine, the recipes I DON’T have programmed in my frother appear first. Why? I don’t want those, so instead I have to swipe past to get to the recipes I do have programmed. Finally, there’s only 1 screen that accesses the machines & it’s the first screen. So if you move to another section, it’s then multiple swipes & taps to get back to your machines. 

Seems this app is only truly good for ordering—the rest of the info is practically useless. Clearly secondary is the machine connectivity section, which is very disappointing considering that’s the primary reason I need this app. I can order capsules online, so that should be the secondary use of the app, in my opinion.

I think this is an easy fix and suggests the lack of concern for the customer! I am currently on my third Frother, each one simply quit Frothing! They replaced it each time after a long telephone routine... with full history online... and the last time they acted like they were doing me a favor, pointing out the Warranty was nearly at its end! I asked what happens when this 3rd machine quit Frothing and was told, “You may be given a coupon to buy a new one!” Each Customer Service Agent was nicer than the next and I elevated the discussion the last two times to a Supervisor and a Technical Service person... again... one nicer than the next! What that tells me is the company simply does not care about the actual complaints and resolving internal issues to the Customers satisfaction! They have convinced me of a perception of care, but perhaps I am a little to gullible! Perhaps it is time to shop for a new machine, even though I like the Coffee...

I have left this feedback when my package arrived late multiple times to the Nespresso team, in which 1-2 times I wasn’t even sent a tracking order email. Additionally, after leaving the big city to a different state when I input *new* address and checkout to “NEXT DAY” free shipping but apparently that’s not for all states. It’s very misleading. I would love to give the app 5/5 but that would be a lie. It really needs fixing. And the “grey” color scheme when clicking on more makes it seems like you cannot click on anything, it’s atheistically unpleasant and confusing; as that color scheme is often used to let a user know the feature or option is unavailable.

The sale of the machine was all that seemed to matter, not any of the problems I needed resolved to actually use it. Not a great experience. In the modern world of technology support is everything and theirs sorely lacks. Also, the manual that comes with the device is a joke.

Time has passed. I can’t say I’m any more impressed. Another day and more time and I was finally able to create an account. So I ordered product. Two weeks, yes, I will receive my order in two weeks. So since I have no pods I can’t even use my new modern device. Sheesh!

Gave it time. When it works, great coffee. But, in the short time I’ve had the machine, just over three months, I have had to call tech support way-too-much.

App is fine . I use it to just order the coffee , and it does it’s job perfectly fine .
Coffee on the other hand is horrendous . I have ordered every single vertuo cup they have . Coffee is very weak . It doesn’t have body . Also not sure why almost all of their coffees are bitter . The machine spins the cup fast in order to incorporate air in the coffee …that way the coffee comes out with lots of foam.  People associate foam in the coffee with good quality coffee. Since the coffee is so weak , I can’t help but assume that they’re adding something in there to make it seem strong…and in the process it makes it bitter . I’ve actually tried to drink 2 vertuo cups every morning for a week, and 2 cups of Turkish coffee that I made myself . I had heartburn almost everyday after drinking the vertuo cups and no heartburn with the Turkish coffee . I also tried it Starbucks coffee , that a lot of people think it tastes burnt .

You can also set up recurring orders that ship automatically on your chosen day and at selected intervals (weekly, monthly, etc.). 

There’s a feature of recurring orders to change the next shipment only (also available on the website). There does seem to be a bug that occurs sometimes when you do this. Recent examples; I wanted to add a sleeve of decaf and it appeared to work but come to find out my original order was deleted and only the decaf was on the order. The order was subsequently canceled because I don’t think they’ll ship only one sleeve. Another time I wanted to add a recycling bag and for some reason they weren’t available. I canceled and when I happened to take a look at it again later, the order had changed to 12 sleeves (😯) of each coffee I usually order instead of the typical three of each in my order - 24 total for a cost of $264!

Great photography used as in all Nespresso marketing:) App does work but there is no easy way to modify your order. The previous order pops-in uninvited and you have to kill items one by one and then close window and add more and verify the hidden items in the list.

In addition you can’t even send a letter to management.  They don’t really provide an avenue to make official complaints.  TERRIBLE customer service, online and in stores!  Love the coffee but looking for an alternative due to lack of customer service. If you participate in their recycling program the actual customer, who collects they dirty capsules and transports them to the postoffice, doesn’t benefit from this good deed at all.  Nespresso in turn, advertises their recycling efforts and rewards NEW customers with recycled coasters from old capsules that existing customers have collected and returned.  How is that for customer service?? While trying to submit a one star review, apparently every nickname I could come up with was already taken and wouldn’t accept my one star review.

Today the problem was the default on shipping.  I ordered over $50 in sleeves, but my basket was showing $6.95 in estimated shipping, which I did not understand.  The very helpful customer service rep explained that I must have chosen 2 day shipping.  When I worked through the checkout process again, I discovered that 2-day shipping is the default!  Seems to me that the free shipping should be the default if over $50 in sleeves is ordered, allowing users to upgrade to 2-day if they wish to do so.

Ordering and putting items in your cart is easy BUT that’s really all that’s good.  Then comes the bad. You CANNOT apply any Promo codes to your cart, it simply doesn’t let you. On the website under troubleshooting they say that if this occurs then you’d better order via the website. Then why have the app at all? 
Another bad point for ordering via the app is that you will NOT get an Order Confirmation Number which they ask for when you call them about where your package is. Duh!!!
Called customer service and they said that if you order via website you get order confirmation #. Again, why have an app at all then??
Another bad thing Nespresso will never send you a shipment tracking info. But that’s both for website and app as well. This also means that you will have to call them if you want to know about when you would be receiving your order.  And it’s a problem if you don’t know your order number. To me this is very dumb.

They're here in 48 hours and the coffee is always fresh.  We definitely tend towards the stronger blends. 8 to 12 point strength ratings.  Have not found 1 that disappoints. 

I have friends that still stick to traditional makers because their “less expensive “ per cup.

They do not have all the sizes of the pods listed, seems to be only logical to have it posted in description of each pod. Another scam is their Next Business Day(Coffee Orders) express delivery.

3 I entered a new credit card and hit Continue. Nothing seemed to happen but then I realized there was a message at the very top of my screen that had scrolled off so I didn’t immediately see it. It said Recheck your information. Which was pretty generic but I finally realized that the Billing Address was wrong so I fixed this but now I had to re-enter all of my credit card info.

Why don't you  also offer a decaf “double espresso” ??.

Make tracking orders easier like large retailers in the US. This takes you to the Nespresso sight then gives basic information.  I want detailed status, like the current location and when it will be delivered all in the app.

The app works well for what it needs to, however it’s a bit clunky and doesn’t really adhere some design aspects many apps are using.

There are really only two big things I felt needed an update:

First, the two pictures of ristretto and arpeggio capsules seem out of place. They make it seem like you can scroll down to see all of the capsules in Nespresso’s lineup, however they’re just fixed with some text over top of them that’s barely readable.

Second, the store portion of the app is functional, but feels a little dated and doesn’t really match the rest of the app. App performance is also sometimes a bit glitchy.";"2018-08-14T14:54:28-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=342879434&type=Purple%20Software";"342879434";129;"en";"POSITIVE"

1. The app is crashing when you try to activate Face ID on the iPhone XR at least. Every time. 

2. When registering my Nespresso machine: What is the point of asking me to choose my model (among 20), then torturing me with a choice of color with 50+ options that you didn’t bother to filter out the models that are NOT mine? WHat’s the point of even asking for this information when the next question is “what’s the SERIAL NUMBER” of the machine? Here’s a simple solution: Ask for the serial number first. Look up the color and model and bang! You can then ask about model/color for those who don’t/won’t/can’t provide you with a serial number. I’ll end up not registering my machine because I can’t get the color right and this process is really bugging me.

1)you can’t add the free samples To your order in either app, only in the browser-based ordering. It’s only 2 capsules, so ymmv as to whether that’s a big deal or not. You can take advantage of promotions (free sleeves, for instance) in the apps, just not the “free samples”
