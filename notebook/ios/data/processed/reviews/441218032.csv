Back then, editing a Raumfeld playlist was easy. Now editing a Teufel playlist is stressful. While editing a playlist, I need to gesture with one finger in just the right spot at just the right speed and at just the right direction in order to move the song I want to move. As if that wasn’t enough, I just was moving a few songs in playlist, and for no apparent reason, the playlist has now duplicated and appended itself to itself... What the —-?

Please work on this";"2019-03-27T11:59:19-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=441218032&type=Purple%20Software";"441218032";106;"en";"NEUTRAL"

It's good, not perfect. Some buttons are too small, some services like Deezer are still missing and you can't use iTunes Match, BUT everything else works great and the developer is adding features on a regular basis. Keep up the good work, Teufel!";"2014-12-21T08:42:27-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=441218032&type=Purple%20Software";"441218032";59;"en";"POSITIVE"
