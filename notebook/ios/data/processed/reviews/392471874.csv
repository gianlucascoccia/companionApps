It was always true. If space temperature was below set point it meant the boiler was out. I would call my daughter who leaves nearby to have her restart boiler, check fuel level or call for service.

It forces you to do things in specific (and frankly pretty dumb) order, like you can‚Äôt put it on hold unless you take it off auto first. And if you do that, the temp setting changes, and the air shuts off and you have to wait for it to come back on, even if you just adjusted the setting to make it come on. Please fix it to be smarter, or at least delay sending updates to the thermostat a few seconds so we can finish what other adjustments we want to make!

Please make the temporary adjustment smarter. Many times I've wanted to change the temp 10mins before a schedule point, and in 10mins it goes back to the program setting and not where I want it.
This could be easily fixed with a timed hold (and timed off-hold), so when I put a hold on, I can say release the hold in 4 hours, or 5 days.
OR- make a manual change persist for some configurable time, even if a schedule point is very soon.

When you take the system off hold or make other adjustments, give us a few seconds to finish our changes! When I take it off hold, the app immediately jumps up to the high program set point and turns the AC off, even when I want to have a lower temporary set point and just remove the hold. The thermostat stupidly causes unnecessary cycling of the AC and makes me wait before the AC will turn back on even when it should have never turned it off!
Either that, or just let me enable/disable the hold setting without mucking with my current set point!

Previous review (not sure if these problems still persist, as haven't had demand events recently):
When you opt out of a demand event, the app automatically places the system in hold mode!

When I installed it on my computer and phone the process was very simple and easy; I got through right away to technical support and customer service.  I've not had any problems with my connection since installing it about 1 year ago.  As of a few days ago my thermostat was not connected to the company server and would not allow me to control it from my phone or computer for two nights straight.  I had to get out of bed, bundle up, and go downstairs to make the adjustment to my thermostat.  That defeats the purpose of wireless remote.  PLEASE FIX THIS PROBLEM!  I've never had this problem with the old version!  I would love to give this a much higher rating . . . however, this upgrade has prevented me in doing so.

Being able to monitor and control the temperature in your house, office, or other property at any time from anywhere in the world is simply incredible.

This app works very well and was easy to set up. I like the way it was done with a temporary ad-hoc WiFi network prior to having Internet access. The app had some bugs in the older releases, but they have done an amazing job of adding features and making it more stable since then.

This way I can adjust when I see the mother in law jack up the heat to 80.

But the developers listened to the complaints, and made significant improvements. Not only did they add back the features omitted from the original app, but they added the ability to program the weekly schedule from within the app. Before this change, you could only program the schedule using a Web browser and a clunky HTML interface.

The device was easy to install however the back of the device could been designed to accept a center wire harness input and fan out of the wires instead of an over the top layout.

The ability to see and set your schedule via a website or an app is great.  This is so different than most ""set back"" thermostats wherein you must set your schedule using a tiny display and a few buttons.  You will use this setback schedule feature because it is usable.

Also - when initializing the app to your tstat it was not clear that you need to turn off your cellular data (in iPhone settings) to restrict the WiFi to tstat network. That probably doesn't make sense until you use the app the first time.

The concept is very powerful and promising, but the execution (especially for a $100 thermostat) is dismal. 

1) Initial setup and pairing with the thermostat is an absolute nightmare straight from hell itself.

2) Often doesn't even work. Sometimes won't connect. The app just hangs with the progress indicator indefinitely. Must restart app and wait for slow load process. 

3) Often ignores your changes. Change temp, tap to push update, progress indicator shows, when the screen comes back the old target temp still shows and your change is ignored. Looking at the thermostat itself confirms no change was made. 

4) In auto-mode, you can't make adjustments to the temperature.

5) No ability to adjust schedule from the app.

1) Turn off wifi and data in settings.

2) Launch thermostat and it will pop-up a retry button.

3) close and re-enable wifi. This is faster of jailbroken because you can double-tap home and click anything (just so you can launch sbsetting and turn in wifi while thermostat running in background).

4) double-tap home and bring up thermostat. After you've re-enabled wifi, click retry and it should work. Worked for me and now it Doesn't crash.

Cons:
1. Personally, I liked that the old app looked like the face of the wall thermostat.  And on an iPad the app came up fine in portrait mode.
