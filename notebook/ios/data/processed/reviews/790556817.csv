I too have T-Mobile, and lost the remote connectivity with the latest update. It’s a great product, I have several cameras in my home. Notifications and snapshots still get through, but no live streaming off-site. 

Sort of defeats the whole purpose of the app. I don’t need live streaming in my own home! I need to be able to check on my home while away. 

This live streaming used to work great with the old version. Please fix it!!

Thank you!";"2017-11-02T09:10:14-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=790556817&type=Purple%20Software";"790556817";95;"en";"POSITIVE"

At first, sounded like a great investment, and it did worked for some time... but then a year ago the camera started to act weird.  I can’t view or access it through my T-Mobile service. I can ONLY view, access the camera via WiFi.  This happened a year ago and it was fixed.  BUT this week - out of nowhere - I can’t access my camera again through my phone unless I’m on WiFi. Seriously???! Again?!? Doesn’t it render this security camera useless while I’m on the go? Ugh.

This new app allows more than 4 sensors.  But if you already use the older app, you need to remove it and then reboot each sensor.  After that you follow the instructions as though each camera was a new device... (Don't hit the ""change wifi"" button by mistake.)

Now, the options are presented as a horizontal scrolling tape across the lower part of the screen.

Amaryllo offers a cloud storage plan for a monthly service fee. Personally, I have no use for that plan, unless it can offer me something besides simple on-line storage at rates comparable to the usual providers.  I am assured that Amaryllo will continue to support the basic free Google-like cloud plan.  I just hope that none of these people are from Microsoft marketing.

I am a user of iCam 360. I will like to suggest that the app should also be able to function such that a users can access the CAM memory via wifi to playback recordings made by the CAM.
