The only major issue we had was when we changed our internet provider and had to reactivate it on the new network. The steps are rather daunting.

My biggest disappointment has come of recent with the discontinuation of IFTTT support. I’m sure it has to do with money, it’s always about money... but IFTTT really covered the spaces where pipers app lacked. One simple feature is just having a simple on/off time, geofencing is nice when it works... and come on guys, Life360 integration has been in beta for more than 3 years! Honestly the updates are bug fixes and that’s it, no advances in the usefulness of the app. The Home Vitals is a good feature, but it’s really just statistics, you can’t do anything with it, and it only keeps 48 hours at a time on record.

It works pretty well as far as sensors, unit operation, and quality goes. But my biggest complaint is once the device is triggered it records about a 30second video and then stops recording and you either manually re-arm the device thru the phone app or have it auto re-arm every 5 minutes. So if I can't use my phone when the Piper is triggered, when I'm driving for example, this gives me only 30seconds of recorded security footage every 5 minutes maximum. A lot can happen in 5 minutes where I won't have any video recording! I would like to see longer videos recorded once a device is triggered and an option for instant re-arm after a video is recorded. If server size is an issue then you can limit for how long or how much data can be stored before it's removed.
Also, I would like to have the option to record a video while I'm in the live feed screen, so if unauthorized activity is occurring while I'm in the live feed, I can make a recording.

I've called them before and they said ""we are considering this"". They are nice people, but this is crazy! Like other reviewers sey they do freeze up regularly (maybe once every week or so). That I can even deal with. And if you have multiple pipers, you do not get addition protection, only the ""main"" piper triggers/records anything once and then it is done. All the other ones do nothing (except let you do a live view) but they are useless as an actual security feature. Maybe they are just trying to save on disc space for themselves and are too cheap to allow for the extra storage this would require.

1. It would be nice for Piper to use the phones GPS and automatically turn off when I arrive home.

 2. Adding a section under ""rules"" for selecting a time and/or date range to activate Piper. For instance, I would like Piper to be able to automatically switch from ""off"" to ""away""( or whatever setting you wish) from 11pm until 6am, while I am asleep. 

3. There needs to be a way to deactivate the siren within the app. Create a separate password to deactivate it- but not being able to turn that thing off easily is a huge problem for the user. 

I have also been having issues with Piper not registering movement and recording videos. It seems it waits a certain amount of time before alerting/recording a new video- this is annoying and a potential reason not to buy Piper.

I have been using my Piper NV for about a year now. I was initially frustrated with their new app design, which seemed like an unnecessary change, but I find that I'm not using the app a ton now anyway. Check out the IFTTT app for some cool automation, I use a proximity arm / disarm so that I don't have to open the app to do so - works every time. I also made some buttons on IFTTT so that I can turn my Z-wave lights on and off without going into the app.

The most important thing is that they seem to have stabilized live streaming in the back end - whether through LTE or wireless, I haven't had problems in awhile. The app runs stable and does what it needs to do - I just learned about a 4 minute power outage last night thanks to Piper.

My suggestions for the product team: 
- Give users a data cap for storing video / data, and up the silly 1 min. time restriction on videos. That burglary isn't going to only take a minute - and I don't care about any of the other recordings.

- As a user, when live streaming or viewing recordings, I would like to be able to view it from both orientations (landscape), when i flip my phone over 180 degrees.

If I say yes, I have to re-log in. If I say no, the app shuts down and I have to re-log in later. Either way, super inconvenient. 

This app is MUCH slower than the previous 1.x releases and often never connects to Piper at all, making us prisoners in our own home, unable to disarm the system.

The interface is horrible. I miss the simplicity of the large wheel with the easy-to-see icons. The new ones are confusing and tiny. A text option would be nice. A clean app doesn't have to remove all text... Color-coded *labeled* buttons work fine. 

The Z-wave options should not be buried underneath unmarked menus. If I want to turn a lamp on or off, i have to figure out which button to press (since they're not marked in any way) then find my way to the device. What was a simple option in v1.x is now a multi-step difficult process in 2.x.

What used to be a fantastic system with unparalled support and a great app seems to have been clouded by the misconception that clean and simple means less labeling and more cryptography. As the end user, I ask that you revisit the app redesign again, increase the size of the arming options, place an emphasis on connection quality and speed, and make the interface easier to navigate in a true emergency situation.

Unfortunately I had stopped using it due to a couple issues. One, there were frequent connection issues. This seems to mostly be a thing of the past. Two, the lack of any sort of ability to arm and disarm automatically based on time, location, etc. This latest update makes a big leap forward in that regard. I had never heard of Life360, but it seems to work well. The auto-arm feature based on location works great. It is not quite ""auto"" however. I would prefer an option to remove the requirement to acknowledge the arming and just trust it to arm itself. Also needs the ability to auto disarm upon coming home.

Neither iPhone will connect via LTE and now via ""wifi"" either. We're using iPhone 6 and 6s. I have reset the piper and completed an initial set up hoping to resolve the issue to no avail. 
The PiperNV does however still work with IFTTT. I have been able to arm/disarm based upon a schedule. I know that this is not ideal but it allows for some automated protection until this issue is fixed. One thing to be aware of is that IFTTT only allows for arming and disarming formulas in 15 minute increments so you could use it to disarm your piper prior to arriving home outside or your regular schedule but it requires a little bit of planning so that you're sitting outside of your house waiting for the next quarter hour.

This is a problem because when I come home it can take over a minute to disable the alarm.  Imagine how frustrating this can be if you set of the siren and can't turn it off.

The app rarely self updates with status changes.  For example if I open a door I have to hit refresh to see the status update if the zwave sensor.  The refresh can take anywhere from a second to a minute.

The status of zwave smart switches takes equally long to update.

Camera live view is unreliable with frequent failures to connect or dropouts.

As others have said, it takes far too long to initialize the app every time. As it's a security app, every second counts. I can't understand why the app simply can't be active in the background and require a simple (1-2 second) refresh when you come back to it.

The other extremely frustrating issue is how unreliable the connections are to door/window sensors. Those things are pricey, and when Piper seems to register them as open or closed at random, it undermines the security of your household in a big way.

If those two bugs (and they are most definitely bugs, this is not a feature request) were fixed, I'd gladly ""double down"" and go further with Piper as our home security system.";"2014-08-06T05:40:55-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=741005248&type=Purple%20Software";"741005248";146;"en";"POSITIVE"

I have had piper for just over a year now and have had excellent results. I installed for cameras and recently added a fifth night vision camera at my new house with a new job after a move. While I have had some issues with the connectivity of the Z wave, once I finally got them working they have worked very well. I do wish for a couple of things including a more expensive list of Z wave support but I'm currently using a Wink for a few other areas. It helps to have both systems in case one goes down but I would like the integration of the two at some point.  The system has worked well for the security of my home as well as being able to monitor my young children who like to go in and out of doors without anyone knowing. The support has been amazing, fast, and reliable. I trust that this will continue and the capabilities will expand. I looked at several systems and options before I decided to go with piper because of the expense of options of the camera itself and the flexibility of the system. I would like to see an option in the software to be able to view all of my cameras at once as well as remove the limitation of five cameras that can be linked together as I could use a couple of more for key areas on my property. I will say that I am fortunate enough to have some high-speed Internet which included at one point a fiber optic option and hope to have that fiber optic option again in my new location. A good Wi-Fi system is key and if you can get a static IP it helps but I currently do not have one and it is still working great.";"2015-04-14T10:27:28-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=741005248&type=Purple%20Software";"741005248";334;"en";"POSITIVE"

The camera works great. The ability to detect motion in the room works great. It integrates with Z wave devices, which lets you put sensors on your door and even take video when the door opens. That's all quite amazing.

The app is so so. I could complain about funkiness on the interface, but it works fine.

The real killer problem is login and network reliability. The system always takes a little while to login. And this is a pain when you're sitting at the door waiting to get into the house, or wanting to get on your way as you arm the system. Why oh why can't it save login state, and use the cloud database in a model view control scheme. Perhaps like my Rachio does. 

Sometimes this login delay is significant. Here, login fails, you have to restart the app, then go through another login attempt, and wait, and wait. Often, it has to re-login while you're using it, adding more frustrating delays to you getting the system armed or disarmed. That's a real pain when you're sitting outside the door, waiting to come into the house.

The other pain is that sometimes the unit itself loses network conductivity. The network still sees the unit there, but the unit doesn't respond. Perhaps it crashed. Perhaps it's in an infinite loop. Perhaps the server somewhere in the cloud is dead. Who knows. Other times the unit goes offline from the app perspective but is still posting events. Just more networking bugs.  

In fact, I'm writing this review tonight, because the system's network crashed while it was armed. It was not fun unplugging it and pulling the batteries while the siren was blasting.

I hope piper can fix all the login and networking problems. I recommend they go back to the books on this one. And then later post the code they use for login security on a developer forum as a study in what not to do. It will make great geek comedy.";"2016-06-10T00:33:16-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=741005248&type=Purple%20Software";"741005248";350;"en";"NEGATIVE"

Aug 23,2014 I had such high hopes for this device. Major flaw is the extremely poor video quality. The website photos are deceptive and false. You will never get clear images like the ones they post. More likely they are of the bad quality, like convenience store robbery videos posted on the local news. Fuzzy and unrecognizable people. Not useful for crime reporting if you had a break-in, nor are the limited 15 sec. Video recorded if alerts are set. Zooming in is so pixelated you could not even tell which of your pets is in frame. I have two pipers on one network. One works most of time. The other disconnects constantly or shuts down completely for no apparent reason. Router pairing takes a bit of time. It is best if your can assign a static ip for each piper. Otherwise, if you reboot your router your apps may not connect to piper if the device IP changes.

Z-wave devices will pair with piper, but according to other users, cannot be controlled with your home controller only piper. Once paired with piper you are stuck only using these with piper. Not very useful for z-wave lighting controls. I have not invested in z-wave devices due to this flaw. Instructions from the vendor are limited. Some users have posted more detailed help in the forum, but piper shut down comments on many topics, especially non-working features. Email support can take several days for a response, but they will keep in touch and try to help, usually recommending you do a complete reset of your devices, which is a time consuming process. Piper is a beautiful design, great concept, poorly realized product and deceptively advertised.

Piper devices have so much potential over their competitors. If only you would add scheduling. I wanted to cry when IFTTT support was removed. It added such functionality that Piper itself did not have. I am glad my devices still work, but would love an update. Anyone?

ORIGINAL POST: I really want to love the device, but nope. My issue isn’t with the app but the devices themselves. I have the Classic Piper (no night vision I think coming out with a security camera that does not have Night Vision is about the stupidest thing I could ever think of but I have digressed). Additionally, I have the Piper NV. My Piper NV constantly is out of sync with the Classic. When I arm my System the Classic will arm yet the NV will not and there are times that my NV will remain armed even though I have disarmed the System. In both cases the NV ignores my request to either arm itself or disarm itself. While the Classic behaves correctly every time. I end up unplugging it then replugging it which is a soft reboot. I have even gone through the process of setting it as if it were new. Sometimes this works but not for long and sometimes it doesn’t work at all. The one feature Piper has over its competitors is that it calls when it detects motion or loud sound when armed. I love that it is an immediate notification. All competitors just send you a text that you may or may not notice. That is why I haven’t completely given up on the device, but you have no idea how frustrating it is. What can be done? It would be nice if there was a way in the App to tell if the device is connected to the other and are in sync. To be able to see which network they are connected to and see the signal strength per device. Yes I can see the IP Address but that really isn’t telling much. This way I would know for sure if my issue is related to the proximity to my router or not. I only noticed this issue because the device kept staying armed even after I had disarmed it, then on another occasion I noticed that I had forgotten to disarm it and went near the Classic only after passing the NV and it started calling my phone. The Classic was armed while the NV was not. Which meant the entire time that I was out of my house only one was armed. Here I was thinking both were. Which is more of a concern than the other scenario. I really think I have a defective device but haven’t been able to get anyone from support to really confirm this.";"2021-06-13T04:13:04-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=741005248&type=Purple%20Software";"741005248";479;"en";"POSITIVE"

Almost unusable, and video/audio quality are extremely poor for HD device. I hope the software team who wrote the requirements and code are replaced. They obviously don't use this product! 

Piper NV is a great product, but the 2.0 app is a huge step backwards in usability! Where is vacation mode? Icons are unintelligible and fonts are too small. More clicks to access features. Why move the modes to the top where I can't reach them with my thumb? Very disappointing...";"2016-06-23T14:05:57-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=741005248&type=Purple%20Software";"741005248";97;"en";"POSITIVE"

Now it takes even longer for the app to connect to Piper, there’s no way to delete events, and the counter keeps going up—making it worthless. But now you buy accessories from within the app, so it’s got that going for it. In short, this is what happens when you let the PR department run the show.";"2015-10-14T18:00:19-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=741005248&type=Purple%20Software";"741005248";69;"en";"NEGATIVE"

Among all cameras, this one was my best decision.
I'm giving only 1 star, because it seems that has security flaws and the customer support...well, there is no customer support!!!
One night, while I was next to the camera and I was watching a movie, I've noticed that the green led, turned to white!!! Oh yes, white color, which means that someone was connected and watching and for sure it wasn't me.
I don't have hardware firewall, but I'm using a MAC address filter to my Apple Airport Extreme, so I will decide which devices can be connected to the router. I'm not sure if this router has a firewall, and I'm not sure how easy it is someone to be connected to this camera, although the MAC filter.
What I know, is that the led was white when I've noticed and after some seconds it turned back to green, while I was almost with open mouth from the surprise that MAYBE someone was watching me.
I contact the viper ""ghost"" customer support and I never get an answer!!!
I'm 100% sure that nobody else has the username and the password to be able to get connected to my camera from another mobile phone.
Be aware!!!

PS: ...and among all, with every single app update, they fix one bug, to create another one. After the last update (1.9.0 Z-Wave Plus Certification Support), the video buffering stays forever at 0%.
That means no live steaming since it cannot buffer the video.
WoW!!!
Well done!!!";"2015-12-10T09:41:23-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=741005248&type=Purple%20Software";"741005248";275;"en";"POSITIVE"

Couldn't get the basic camera to connect to wi-fi systems, neither at my office nor home networks.  Reset camera, app, iPhone, iPad, routers, firmware, etc.  Called customer service, was on hold for several minutes, then heard, ""... leave a message...""  So I left one and still waiting for a call.  Packaged the system back up and will send it back tomorrow.  I'll order a DropCam tomorrow to try that out as they're apparently being purchased by Nest and I really like their thermostat.";"2014-12-15T21:37:57-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=741005248&type=Purple%20Software";"741005248";92;"en";"POSITIVE"
