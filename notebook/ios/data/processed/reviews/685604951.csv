The concept: You don't need a key! You simply touch the lock to lock and unlock it (while in proximity of your phone with the app)

The reality: It rarely works.

Sometimes, I'll tap the lock, the lights'll spin for a few seconds and nothing happens. Then I do it again. Same result. After about 4 tries, I'll finally pull out my key and lock the door manually.

It WILL work when you don't want it to. I'll go out to check the mail and my hand will lightly brush the deadbolt and it'll activate. Or, it'll work when I've given up on it and finally pull my key out and it'll activate just as I go to put my key in the lock after standing there like a goon for 2 minutes trying to get it to work. Or, worse yet, it'll activate just because my key or finger touched the lock as I was inserting my key, sometimes creating an error when it tries to lock it after I just unlocked it (or vice versa).

Why couldn't this work when I need it to and have my hands full with groceries (coming home) or the items I need for work (leaving)? Nope. Only works effortlessly when I don't need it to at all.

It's literally the worst. I don't know if there are better options out there, but it's impossible to have worse options. Avoid at all costs.

The only reasons it gets two stars are because (a) you can’t rate it lower and (b), at the very least if you have your phone, you’ll never be locked out.";"2021-08-09T09:41:53-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=685604951&type=Purple%20Software";"685604951";287;"en";"NEGATIVE"

The app simply doesn’t connect very easily to my phone, and when it does, it takes forever. I feel like a fool sitting there waiting for it to connect when I could have been inside already if I just used my regular key.

My current lock ""the Kēvo"" if only you were HomeKit compatible 😡 but besides that this lock works great! It was a little tricky to connect to my wifi for updates but that's more so do to our home being 2 levels & the wifi is up stairs! No smart lock is perfect and they all have flaws but from my experience the Kēvo hands down was the best option for my family and I. They even give you a option of buying key fobs to use instead of your smart phone. I purchased 2 and use them in addition to my smartphone and 9 times out of 10 & works flawlessly. If you are have connection issues just read the manual thoroughly and follow directions accordingly! They also have a 800 number if you need guidance.

I love the lock but it does have a learning curve. When I first set up the lock with my phone I set the proximity too close meaning I often had to pull my phone out and hold it close to the lock. When I purchased the gateway I reset everything including my proximity a good arms length away (I'm 6'2"") and now I can touch my lock and activate it farther away, not usually a problem. The added benefit is leaving the house and not always have to be facing the lock and waiting for it to lock. But sometimes I still do. I have noticed if my phone is in my pocket and screen is facing my body, I need to be very close to the lock. This may be due to my heavy protective case. Another thing I've noticed about the lock, sometimes I touch it and it doesn't sense that I did. After making sure I didn't turn into a vampire, I learned that if I rub my fingers quickly and touch the lock it senses them. I don't have particularly cold hands often. I'm happy with how the app functions but haven't updated my phone to latest iOS because I heard it doesn't work as well yet. I don't use my fobs so no input there.

Now it's pretty much useless. With the iPhone or keyfob, the dumb blue light turns round and round until time runs out.... Over and over again. The worst part is that when I open it with the key manually and a slight breeze of air touches it as I walk past it the lock kicks in right as I swing the door close and yup, the lock smacks my door frame!!! Talk about insult to injury. Every time it does that I want to punch someone in the face!!! If you like things that rarely work and frustrate you then buy 4 of these! If you want something that works then avoid this crap at all cost!!!

UPDATE: So I figured if I got the wifi puck it would work better. But $100 later and it isn't much better. I can lock and unlock my keyvo sometimes but it takes like 1-2 minutes to connect and unlock or lock. I thought it would be useful when it ""updates"" the status of the lock but it's not accurate. More than half the time it will give me bad info. It says the lock is ""unlocked"" then my kids try to open the door and they yell at me ""It's locked dad!"" So I hit the ""lock"" on my phone so it can ""unlock"" the door and 1-2 minutes later it unlocks the door. I would not recommend this lock to any of my friends.

I guess I’m old fashioned, but I rarely allow myself to be 100% dependent on ANY technology. That means I am delighted when it works, which is most of the time, and never frustrated by rare failure.

I have discovered a consistent vulnerability that I have not seen identified in the reviews here yet. If you use the iPhone’s bluetooth for any other task, such as music at home, Kevo seems to lose its control of bluetooth every time, even though “sharing” is active. Other apps are not “sharing” at all, just taking over completely. If I turn off bluetooth after use, “force quit” Kevo in background, then re-launch everything, it restores reliable Kevo function. (My husband uses an Apple watch, so he has given up using Kevo entirely.)

None of that changes my opinion that Kevo is a great household tool. I think the person who used it for commercial application is an idiot - there are digital combination deadbolts that can be programmed for multiple users, that are more secure, robust, and reliable. You should really consult a professional locksmith when you have business/commercial lock needs.";"2018-01-15T06:18:22-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=685604951&type=Purple%20Software";"685604951";205;"en";"POSITIVE"

Also I wish the Kevo Plus came with the lock... For $229 it should have... & to have to spend $99 for internet connectivity it should already have it. Also I would like to have widget functionality on my iPhone & added to the Apple Watch... August has the widget & Apple Watch app... Please add these features & try to make it where I don’t have to have the app running on my iPhone X & can’t close it if I wanna use the lock... Please fix it... Also maybe add HomeKit functionality, maybe that will make it where it won’t need to run in the background... Thanks & hope you consider this!!!

I have experienced many of the things that others have noted but do not find them to be as frustrating or inconvenient as others have mentioned. Since my vehicle is push to start and I do not have to take keys out to start the car it is nice that I don't have to take keys out to open the door either. Since I live in Florida I have not experienced issues related to cold-weather that others have mentioned. Since it is only two of us in the household my husband been uses the key fob that was supplied when the device was purchased and I use the ekey. When phone is in my back pocket I usually have to turn my backside to the door or take it out of my pocket to get it to unlock. And there is a short delay of  a few seconds before it unlocks but no more than it would take if I were putting a key in the lock and turning it. The lock/unlock history is not useful to me since both the key fob and the electronic key are registered in my name. It would be nice if I was able to assign unique names to key fobs and eKeys. I hope they will make electronic key functionality available on the Apple Watch when it is available.";"2015-02-19T05:36:48-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=685604951&type=Purple%20Software";"685604951";235;"en";"NEGATIVE"

More times than not I'm left standing at my door staring at the blue ring spin and spin time after time until I finally pull my phone out of my pocket and open the app, so that I can finally get into my house. Now this app is supposed to work as long as it remains open in the background but that is about as dependable as the weather man. It might work but it's probably not going to and if it's poring rain you can bet your life it's not going to work. Now I guess every time I come home I could pull my phone from my pocket and open the app, but seems to me if that were the case it would be just as easy to use a key and certainly cheaper than buying a lock that cost $200. To make matters worse the lock never seems to fail after you've unlocked the door and are walking in, because if you accidentally bump the lock it will lock and the exposed bolt then slams into the molding around the door as you close it, dinging it up really nice for you. If I could give you any advice it would be leave this lock at the store and save your money, and if you've just bought it pack it up and take it back.";"2016-01-22T09:01:51-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=685604951&type=Purple%20Software";"685604951";277;"en";"POSITIVE"

Second thing - why is there no BOTTOM lock from Kēvo or pretty much any vendor?   I just don't understand that.  I have an upper lock and a lower lock but I can only automatically unlock the upper lock.

Sometimes the lock is slow to detect the phone which require 2-3 touches of the lock. Occasionally I have to shut down the app and reopen it for it to work. The Kevo Plus seems to work pretty consistently for me. Pretty consistently slow that is. My app takes time to refresh the current status of the lock. Often I have to shut down the app, too. Other than some slow connectivity issues, it works well. I have never been locked out of my house due to it now working. Actually, one time I left my phone in the house and my wife locked the door with her phone as we both left. I forgot something and had to go back. I was locked out. I was able to call my wife from my Apple Watch and she remotely unlocked the door. It would be nice to have a native app on the watch that could serve as a key too. Currently, it is only able to view and interact with alerts that come directly from the phone. Overall, I do like the lock. We pre-ordered and have been happy customers since.

I thought it was a pretty decent block and at the time it worked well. I actually bought two. One on the front door we use daily the one on the back door just occasionally. The back door with occasional use needs to have battery changed about every 10 days. The front door used to work excellent, however, since you now have to have the app open all the time in order to open your lock it's very hit or miss and mostly mostly mostly it's a miss as far as getting the door to unlock the first time every time you tap the lock.
For about three months there was a time when the app was not needed all you had to do was walk up to your door with your Bluetooth turned on and the door would automatically unlock. This was an amazing feature! Now when you walk up to it you must have the app on!!! This is such BS! Since this update it's reliability has gone completely downhill. I will not recommend the Kevo to anyone until they make it so the app does not have to be running on the phone.

I am also a bit confused with the settings in this app. Do you have to have it open all the time? What does power save mode actually do? It doesn't adjust the location services at all. And it doesn't matter if power save is on or off, the drop down message telling you to reopen the app to use the product still drops down. What's up with that? Very confusing overall. And kind of a bad deal without the built in wifi in that giant appliance. Also, no Apple Watch support. What's up with that? If you happen to shell out the extra $99 for the wifi adapter, it would sure be nice to control it from a watch.

I may have discovered a bug in the app. It seems whenever I have Kevo open on my phone, it disables the sound in my AirPods for the phone app. But only the phone app. Sound works in the music app and a couple others I have. I haven’t done thorough testing, but it seems to be the case as to what is happening.

It is frustrating that the app has to be actively open on your phone to function which completely negates the point of a touch-lock. Now, I must be holding my open phone to unlock my door which leaves me with yet one more thing to fumble with. Leaving the app open in the background is no good either, unless of course you're one of the billions of people with a smartphone that never actually uses it and can afford to feed the majority of your battery life to your battery-hungry Kēvo app.

When this works it's great. Sadly though it rarely works as advertised. More often than not, we have to touch the lock twice or even three times to trigger the lock or unlock. Even holding my phone next to the lock. Totally defeats the purpose as it's actually more convenient to pull out a key than to fumble with my phone tapping the lock a couple of times waiting 10 or 15 seconds each time. 

Distance lock/unlock is worthless. Have to be so close and it takes so long to actually connect, authenticate, and move the lock it would be much faster just to walk over and use a key. 

Lack of z-wave connectivity is also a gap. 

Overall, you can tell this is a solution developed by a legacy company that has never had to think forward with respect to tech. Half way there. Fix the connectivity issues, fix the distance limitations, and incorporate z-wave and this would be a killer lock. Sadly, as an early adopter and still waiting like 2 years, I have low confidence this will be updated. I was optimistic when I saw the lock was recently ""improved"" but customer service couldn't tell me any more detail other than what was on the package as to what was actually changed. 

My recommendation is to skip this lock for at least another generation. Go with one of the smaller more forward thinking companies for the foreseeable future.";"2017-01-01T17:22:48-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=685604951&type=Purple%20Software";"685604951";257;"en";"POSITIVE"

I am reading many reviews and I do agree with some on certain issues. 
First of all keep in mind that nothing is totally perfect yet and never will be. To fully follow and to understand instructions is important. The lock works very well just as it should. As far as being slow when opening and closing that is normal and precisely correct. In fact sometimes I have to tap the lock more than once for it in order to lock/unlock. This tells me that the system/app is communicating with the key (my finger). 
You wouldn't want the lock to open/close for just anyone who taps /touches the lock. Also the time lapse when closing/opening depends on the wifi/Bluetooth signal strength but the most important OBJECTIVE is that the lock will never falsely operate/function. For me personally this is the only reason why I installed the lock in my house/door. 
I have tried to manipulate the lock and to trick it to open but no way no how I succeeded and that is exactly why I like Kēvo lock even more. 
As for anything in life you cannot please everyone every time and until then take the good with the less good.

What is even more troubling is the times when we don't have our phone anywhere near the lock (20' +) and have it lock when you bump it walking out of the door. 

We spent the money to get the Kevo plus so we could check the door remotely. This was very difficult to setup on more than one phone and only sporadically gave us an accurate indication of the lock status. One thing that would help is if the the app had a dedicated lock and unlock button. The app has one button that toggles the lock. When you look at it for the lock status remotely and it erroneously says it is unlocked. So you press the button to lock it but in reality now you have unlocked it. I want a button that just says lock door. The lock can make sure it is locked regardless of its current status.";"2017-01-06T14:49:08-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=685604951&type=Purple%20Software";"685604951";243;"en";"POSITIVE"

As long as Bluetooth is on, all you need to do is tap the lock and it will unlock/lock in a second or two. I don't believe you even need to have the app running in the background but I could be wrong about that.

I keep my iPhone 6s Plus in my front pocket and have never had an issue with the lock not unlocking, and the phone is maybe 3 to 4 feet away from the lock itself.

I've had the lock for a little over a month now and the batteries are still running from what was supplied initially. The setup was fairly straightforward and I was even able to reprogram the lock to use the key that was supplied by my landlord so they still have access and I won't have issues with management.

Most of the negative reviews were from 2014 so it seems that Kevo has really improved the lock in the app and it works flawlessly. I would highly recommend this lock to anyone looking for an automated lock solution as it seems that Kevo has sorted out all the kinks and bugs and it works amazingly.";"2016-01-28T10:23:29-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=685604951&type=Purple%20Software";"685604951";209;"en";"POSITIVE"

Now, I feel like we have finally made our peace. The bugs have minimized, I learned how to actually change the batteries on time (get rechargeable batteries, and rotate them...saves money) and most importantly the features promised have been delivered. 

Instead of pulling the bull@&$? other companies try, they don't try and make you buy a $200 Kevo 2.0. They deliver a remote unlocking feature for all users with this update PLUS offer an add on for $70 that enables complete remote operation.

First off there are no instructions for pairing the gateway with the door. The instructions say to configure it using instructions in the app but there are none. 

I finally did get it paired with help from tech-support. Mine is about 20-25 feet away from the door and it routinely cannot ""find"" the door lock. Called Kwikset back and got nowhere with their support. They open a trouble ticket to investigate my problem. They wore me down so much I gave up until about 8 months later. My trouble ticklet was there but NOTHING had been done with it in the entire 8 month stretch. 

Finally got them to send me a replacement gateway. It's the same model, same manufacturer, and it does not look like it's been upgraded at all so I don't have a lot of optimism that it will behave any different.

I really like this lock when I first purchased it.  A little love hate, but mostly love.  It had some issues, but mostly it seemed to work well about 90% of the time.

Then it went to about to about 50/50.

Lately it has been more trouble than joy and new updates don't seem to improve the basically functionality, they only seem to add more features that don't work well.

It used to be that you could have the app closed and the lock would generally function at a normal distance.  Now, even with the app open I have to basically put the hip with the phone in the pocket against the door and it still often won't open.  Half the time I am standing outside with my phone in my hand, maybe an inch from the door and it won't open.  The light circles round and round the lock and the door just won't unlock when you touch it.

Pull up the app and it says connecting and shows orange for locked, but when you press the lock it does a circle and the reconnects.

It has become a disaster, where it is now far easier to just pull out a key and unlock it.  It defeats the very purpose for replacing my old lock.";"2016-01-28T16:11:23-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=685604951&type=Purple%20Software";"685604951";225;"en";"POSITIVE"

When using Kevo not only do I have to pull my phone out of my back pocket (It will not reconginize my phone from that far), I have to hold my phone no more than 12"" from the lock itself. And further more  70% of the time it will not work the first time, so you are now sitting there waiting for it to cycle once then try again. It takes an average of 30 seconds to get in my front door. Count out 30 seconds! It's a long time to sit and wait to get in your front door.

It is also incredibly easy for an owner or permitted user to operate, which is why it's a a smart lock. Notably, from the front, it appears to be a standard deadbolt and doesn't look like a robot attached to your door, begging for attention from unscrupulous clods.

Basically works... But it's hit and miss. Sometimes you have to stand outside your door too long waiting for it to unlock. Getting the Plus gateway helps a lot but it jacks the price up another $100... for a feature and reliability that it should've had in the first place.

It’s impossible to start a scheduled key at a time on one day and continue access until a set time on a different day (e.g. 3pm Mon thru 12pm Fri). I have to send a anytime key and manually remember to activate and delete at the appropriate times. This seems like it would be an easy fix for the developers to add the options. 

I also purchased the additional gateway for reliability in case a guest had issues getting in so that i could do it manually from anywhere. The Gateway works great although it has to be purchased separately. 

Another issue I’ve noticed is in the History. It will show when the door is unlocked by a guest but not when locked.

One of the problems with this lock is that it took so much time to open. The latest update effectively cuts that time and half; we are able to open the lock in a short as two seconds now which is huge. 

Unlike other reviewers, I don't have to keep the app in the foreground, as long as it's been one once after you rebooted or reset the phone you're fine. 

I do wish this product remotely unlocked the door. It's a Bluetooth lock, not a Wi-Fi walk, so it does that limited functionality.

The gateway currently says my door is locked when I can clearly see it's not.

History is hit-and-miss. When someone locks the door, I generally get a notification that the door is locked. However, I rarely get notifications of the door unlocking. I think it's because the phone is switching from mobile data to WiFi but I can't imagine why it didn't occur to the product team that the message should be cached until it could be sent. How hard is that?

Two more crappy experiences that should not exist for a smart phone and a smart lock:

1. The lock should have enough brains to keep a log of key fob unlocks and sync that with the owner's phone when in range.

2. Removing a fob from the lock shouldn't require a complete clearing of the lock. Why do I need to re-add phones when I erase a fob?

I have used this lock for several years now, always hoping the app would improve. My wife couldn’t deal with it, uses key. 
I have been very tolerant. I carry no key and have never been locked out of my home. It always worked, eventually. With iOS 11 it just doesn’t work. I am going to have to put the key back on my ring. 
My only complaint until now has been reliability. You never know if it will work or not. I pretty much try it once and go right to taking my phone out my pocket. It would always work after pulling up the app, only sometimes in background.
