I have nothing bad to say about their products *after* the setup process.
Trying to setup these lights was not fun, especially when you’re setting up 15+ at the same time, and it honestly made me miss the fact that Phillips hue uses a hub on Ethernet instead of connecting each individual bulb to WiFi and HomeKit. After around 8 bulbs were setup the process became extremely unreliable as if the network was saturated despite the fact I had the lights on a separate access point with a special IoT WiFi network. 
This might be my fault or my router but hey the app asked for a rating after hours of googling and resetting bulbs over and over because HomeKit is really good at having “unexpected errors occur”

TL;DR these lights are great but be warned your experience may suffer with too many.";"2021-11-10T15:56:50-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=657758311&type=Purple%20Software";"657758311";173;"en";"POSITIVE"

I only fumbled for a few days, accidentally turning my room mates lights on because of the new swiping features. Once you relearn though, it feels like it was well thought out. 

As far as functionality, it’s a bit wonky. To transition to a scene I want, I have to tap back and forth between two different scenes, as if I have to wake up the lights from a rest mode. Also, I’m aware tiles have been discontinued, at least for now, but the app tends to not have total control over them anymore. I have 3 connected in a straight line. Unless I use a premade scene (and even then sometimes), they will randomly switch to morph. No matter what color I set them to (aside from “off”), they always end up on morph after about 3-5 minutes of whatever I had just set it to. 

Sometimes while browsing colors in the color wheel, you’ll experience the whole wheel spin around incredibly quickly, as if it’s attempting to catch up. Something about this version communicates with the lights much slower than before. This is all minor though, as it only takes a few seconds to troubleshoot and fix any problem.";"2020-04-20T22:00:38-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=657758311&type=Purple%20Software";"657758311";222;"en";"POSITIVE"

What used to be a very straightforward operation in turning lights on or off has become twice as cumbersome with this revised app. The addition of fake line drawings of your different rooms is utterly pointless and only succeeds in filling up the screen so that you’re forced to scroll far too long if you have more than one room set up. The action of turning lights on or off is also much slower and unresponsive with the new app while adjusting individual lights in a group has become very difficult. 

The new app has a greater emphasis on effects such as making all the lights in your house flicker like a candle or perform an epilepsy-inducing strobe. Pointless. Classic case of ‘can we do this’ instead of ‘should we do this’. 

The app development team at LIFX should be ashamed at their lack of user testing. Clearly they’ve been given too much freedom to be ‘artistic’ without any checks on actual usability. I hate this new app and every loyal customer of LIFX will too.

It has some of the best lighting customizations without needed a 3rd party app. I’ve even grown to enjoy the new updates interface that everyone complains about. My big gripe with this app is the Apple Watch version. I usually want to use the watch for my light switches because it’s always on my wrist but it’s always super laggy and takes 5-10 seconds before I can turn the lights on and off with it, which defeats the convenience and speed of having your light controls on the watch. Once it loads up the switches sometimes don’t work or seem to get reversed so off becomes on. 3/5 stars might seem harsh for just the watch app issues but when I am spending $40 per bulb and up to $250 for some of their lights, I expect a perfected and responsive app. I would suggest LIFX adds a 2nd watch widget besides just a button to open the app. If they added a widget that just acted as a switch for a selected group of lights it would go a long way to make the watch experience better.";"2021-05-13T20:23:13-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=657758311&type=Purple%20Software";"657758311";202;"en";"POSITIVE"

Every time I want to copy a scene from the app to HomeKit, it would tell me “export failed” all of the time. Even if I get it to work, it would only copy 2 or 3 or all of bulbs but the colors won’t be the same from the scene I created. Another issue with my HomePod mini. Either it’s the app, iOS 14, or the latest firmware update of these bulbs that are giving my such a headache trying to make them work. Every time I want them to turn on, the HomePod won’t recognize them therefore I have tell Siri through my phone to turn them on and they work or the HomeKit app or the actual app. I also reset these bulbs and my network, after setting them up they would only work for a day then after it would start the whole error again. I shouldn’t have to be having a headache nor be a technician to have these ridiculous and annoying issues from a simple smart bulb that should be working out of the box.

In my opinion one of the best lights to get on the market for beams. $160 for 6 beams including a corner is pretty fair. It comes with a great variety of colors and different settings and themes to go along with it. Love the pallets and overall really bright lights especially for bedrooms. Personally I don’t have a bedroom light or lamp and use the LIFX beams for lighting. The downside is the connectivity. On multiple occasions I had to reset my lights and repair them because the beams lost connection to my wifi, the set up process is very annoying. Unplugging the lights 5x to factory reset is a pain, especially if you have the plugin somewhere behind desk or furniture. Despite connectivity being an issue occasionally these lights are some of the best lights I’ve seen and are my personal favorite.

The depth of color, brightness, and overall quality are the best I’ve ever purchased. 

However, I think the UX/UI  of the LIFX app is quite limited when it comes to allowing the user to easily customize these brilliant strips. For precise projects, the lack of an undo/redo button on the Painting feature makes simple mistakes such a pain to fix. Also more scales of customization like hex colors in the painting feature, and dividing up the painting strip into a little grid that each represents like 2 leds instead of the strange blurred/blended strip that there currently is would be incredibly useful. 

Just some thoughts, but overall an alright app that I think is just limiting the potential of these great quality lights.";"2021-11-01T00:55:16-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=657758311&type=Purple%20Software";"657758311";147;"en";"POSITIVE"

The lights themselves are amazing. Really love them. No questions there about whether I’d purchase again or continue to because I will.

The app on the other hand is barely useable. Here’s a short list of grievances:

- Effects can’t be saved with scenes. This is crazy. Why can I not save the exact setup I want with effects included? I ALWAYS want a specific effect with my studio lights. How hard is this to implement?

- Effects can’t be run without app being on. This is also aggravating for someone who is OCD about constantly quitting apps that aren’t in use by habit.

- Much larger overall issue but the ergonomics hierarchy here is so so wrong. The menu layouts are terrible and it takes many steps to achieve some things that should only take a few clicks. Example: scenes should be stored with built in color palettes. Instead I have to adjust my light, go to another tab, select the scene, go into the scene, assign it, and then go back out. How about, select light, select scene..... done.

- Google Nest integration is broken because of nest/google login issue

Those are just to name a few... this app needs a total overhaul even though you guys put work into the new one. It’s truly objectively bad design.

Love the lights tho!";"2020-09-21T17:40:43-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=657758311&type=Purple%20Software";"657758311";242;"en";"NEGATIVE"

The whole time I never found a bug. Now that it’s released, here one is! At first I thought I was going crazy, but I was able to repeat multiple times.

Here is what I found:
If you set a schedule and change the time from a static hour/minute to sunrise, and then offset the time (in my case, it was 1 hour before), once you hit SAVE, sunrise switches to SUNSET. You have to go back in and re-select Sunrise and then hit save again and it will save correctly.

Now for my general review:
Other than the bug I found, I really think this new app is a huge improvement over the previous version. It’s a lot easier to manage entire groups, set schedules, and the timeline view really helps see the order that everything is happening.  IDK why so many people are finding this version so difficult to work with. If you organize your lights into groups, changes to multiple lights are a lot easier.  Maybe if you only have a small number of lights it’s more cumbersome, but I’ve got 15 and on the old app it took me forever to get everything the way I wanted it.  

But that’s just me. To each their own!";"2020-03-07T03:46:51-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=657758311&type=Purple%20Software";"657758311";221;"en";"POSITIVE"

This new design has been around and it allows us to do the simple things. However, trying to remove a light, a location, is impossible. And for the life of me, i cannot figure out how to get my moms lifx account to stop controlling my lights too ON MY ACCOUNT. No one ever linked these accounts together, yet any change she makes on her lifx account transfers to mine as well. Besides the fact that the lights randomly disconnect and become uncontrollable until you flip the light switch off and on again (which happens often and lifx support does not have an answer to this). I have been wanting to switch to phillips hue for quite some time and this new issue is the final nail in the coffin.  Locating the fun stuff (like the strobe effect) has been very confusing, to the point that my mom has given up on trying to have fun with her light.

There are severe limitations. You cannot create a scene with effects in them. This really makes the bulbs pretty pointless. For example if you wanted to have your bulbs turn on at sunset and shift colors or flicker using the spooky effect. You would have to set the bulbs to turn on at sunset, selecting only one color and then each night go into the app and manually set the spooky or flicker theme or whatever effect. So pretty useless.

1. Go to your phone settings and set your home WiFi to “Auto-Join”. 

2. Press home and open LIFX app and follow directions to connect your light. When you reach the point where it asks you to select your home WiFi. Select the first “WPA(most common)” or whatever your home WiFi type is 

3. Enter your user & password. (Before pressing connect make sure your WiFi setting is open on your phone)

4. Press connect and immediately double tap the home button to switch to WiFi setting screen.

5. Your phone should connect to your home WiFi

Cut to today. One of the lights disconnected for some reason. I attempted to reconnect it and was met with multiple connection errors. Then it would connect, but only for a couple minutes before disconnecting again. 

I did all the troubleshooting and reset both lights multiple times to no avail. 

At one point, both lights were connected and I managed to set up a Day/Dusk schedule, but it was as if the app had the wrong time zone (it was only 1pm, but the app showed it was closer to 5pm). Then, when I would try to delete the schedule to recreate a new one, it would duplicate the previous one. And if I disabled a schedule and re-enabled it, my custom setting would be reset. 

I even deleted and reinstalled the app. Twice.

(remember, I’ve had Wi-Fi routers for 20 years this is the first device on any of my routers having this problem)

Have you tried switching from wifi channels? 1, 6 or 11 tend to work best. Also isolating 2.4 GHz if you have a split network.
If that doesn't help, please also try setting your DHCP lease time to 1 hour (3600 seconds) 

Additionally, your router assigns IP addresses to the bulbs, and they all have certain DHCP lease times. This means that after a certain period- the bulbs will be reassigned IP addresses. When this happens there it the potential of a disconnect. To provide a more stable connection you can reserve a static IP address or Reserve a DHCP address. 

You will want to Log In to your router and navigate to the Wireless page. The MAC address for the bulbs is the same as the 12 digit serial number, if needed.

Everything is too big; the app is cluttered with large, non-functional illustrations; and the most useful features—like controlling individual bulbs— are hidden behind swipes and rounded cards and pop-up menus. 

Even more frustrating, this app brought with it a firmware update that changed the color calibration on all my bulbs without warning, meaning that my HomeKit scenes no longer look right.  Going and individually fixing each of these will be a multi-hour project.";"2020-02-17T03:51:56-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=657758311&type=Purple%20Software";"657758311";97;"en";"POSITIVE"

But looking back at recent reviews of others, it seems like I'm not the only one experiencing issues with this new update. My cheap-o $10 bulb out performs my LifeX bulb from the sheer fact it'll turn on/off on command like it has been for the past year. My bulb has gotten to the point where it's unusable with Alexa, let alone manually turning it on from the app. Half the time it says disconnected from my network, while all the other 10 Alexa/smart enabled devices in my room are fine.

Whatever happened to the app, please revert back so I can at least turn on the lights in my room.

Just to let anyone know how the developers are reacting to this update that happened a few months back, that ruined Lifx's name...

New app remains confusing and focuses on features for the multi-unit home. Interface is not intuitive. More stars for multi-unit home, fewer stars for fewer units.

Pro: the schedule feature allows more than the day to dusk feature. You can turn lights on and off as many times as you like. On and off in the morning, on at night, then dim, then off. Feature I’ve wanted for a while. You can also set it to turn on all lights at once, and turn them off at different times. Takes time to set it up, but in the end, it’s a better addition. 4 of 5 stars- interface could be more intuitive.

Con: still has issues connecting to, and controlling, lights. So find lights never turned off or never turned on.

Also the layout of the new app is very confusing.

Two issues I have involve the effects portion of the app; for them to work (except visualizer, later in review) the app needs to remain in the foreground and I just do not see anyone dedicating their device to only run light effects. Please update app to allow effects to run in the background.

Music visualizer still uses the device’s microphone and is not accurate at all. There should be a better way to implement a music visualizer using music apps api other than a microphone from a device. 

Update these concerns and, for me at least, it will be a 5 star app.";"2020-02-11T18:21:49-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=657758311&type=Purple%20Software";"657758311";113;"en";"POSITIVE"

The latest update for HomeKit made my timer stop working. I usually set the lights to fade and turn off in 30 minutes at night. After the latest firmware and/or app update, my lights timer doesn’t work. 

By the way, I have several of these lights and absolutely love them!

Issue: Home integration with Siri and schedules. Siri mistakenly says the light is turned off when it’s not. 

The light works great but Siri won’t turn the light off if a schedule exists. I have an off at 11pm and on at 7am schedule. When it’s time to leave the house Siri will not turn the light off but say she did. 

The way to reset this is to ask Siri to turn the light on even if it’s still on, then ask her to turn it off to have her actually turn it off. 

Is this a legacy flaw? Are the new bulbs not experiencing this?";"2020-11-19T12:52:24-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=657758311&type=Purple%20Software";"657758311";113;"en";"POSITIVE"
