I could not find a way to create or modify a schedule or program except changing the temperatures fora specific time.
It would be much better to have a representation of your thermostat and all controls at your fingertips.
When you charge so much for a thermostat, you owe your customers an App that supports it appropriately.";"2018-03-28T19:38:51-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=885155482&type=Purple%20Software";"885155482";85;"en";"POSITIVE"

If all of that wasn’t bad enough, it’ll pretend like the change you made has been received when it actually hasn’t been. In my case I’m simply trying to enable and disable “away mode”. Often it looks like the change has been made to the thermostat and I only realize later (sometimes days later) that the change wasn’t received.  This can be costly, both with energy bills and even with safety in some circumstances. I feel like it’s borderline negligence for the app to even be published to the App Store with these issues.

There are so many features I would like to see and so much potential for this, but it is not worth the time.
