If you turn the system off and then on again the schedule will occasionally get hosed up where the sleep times etc are incorrect. No amount of fiddling will fix this, the schedule on and off etc.

Only minor gripe is that the app can be quite buggy at times. When swiping between upstairs and downstairs thermostats the app freezes and often doesn't update to show the current temp and settings. It can be a real pain in the rear when I'm trying to see what's going on and adjust settings while I'm away. I keep hoping that the recent ""bug fix"" updates will improve this responsiveness, but they have not. Hopefully this is something the developer is working on.
