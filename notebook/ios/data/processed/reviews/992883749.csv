Additionally there should be better instructions on connecting the refrigerator to Wi-Fi, noting that 5 MHz radio should be turned off on routers during the initial handshaking, as well as if there is a mesh network (much more common nowadays) all satellite mesh devices should be powered down except for the main device.

The only thing I do not like is the temperature setting - again very spoiled small issue that may be the appliance not the App. It seems that I have to set the unit to 1 or 2 degrees colder than the temperature I want in order for the desired temp to arrive.

Pros: 
Superior control of heat w/inductive burners. 
No baked on crud around burners!!
Even & correct oven temperature. 
Notices sent to phone on pre-heat & timer. 
Temperature probe cooking. 
Clock reading internet and being accurate after a power outage!!!!

Cons:
Broiler not working with door cracked. 
   (Burnt garlic bread way too many times)
Soft scratched stainless trim over control panel. 
Burners on stove top turning off to quickly when lifting a pan. 
Burner controls way too easy to rotate. 
   (Hip all to often adjusting temperatures)
