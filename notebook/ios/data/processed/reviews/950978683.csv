I use a VPN so my cameras aren’t visible directly on the internet and at times the app just doesn’t connect to the camera (I see others talking about this same issue). I could live with that but adding a camera is a pain.  The WiFi connect only rarely works and is useless if you’re away from home anyway.  If the app simply had the ability to add an already configured camera by IP address things would be so much better.

I followed the prompted guide on how the app works and it seems pretty straight forward. No issues thus far. I only have one camera, but if you tap the top right button to select your camera or add camera, it doesn’t seem to be difficult if you have multiple cameras and there is a feature to monitor multiple feeds at once. I’ll prob get one more camera in the future. I will be using this mainly as a baby monitor. It was a great deal on Groupon during Black Friday and I couldn’t pass it up. Does what I need it to do, see my baby via my phone ( instead of a stand alone monitor I’ll have to carry around.) I don’t plan on using the camera while away from home so the issues about logging onto the app while connected through a different internet source (cell or other WiFi) doesn’t apply to me. 

I also had difficulty setting up the device via WiFi so I used the Ethernet cable and it was quick. I could unplug the camera and move it with no problems reconnecting. I noticed a few people mentioning network re-setups was difficult, I would just factory reset the camera to default and reconnect. Seems faster- per the manual online- (reset button/light is next to the Ethernet plug, press and hold for 10 seconds- for the WPS, push once and release reset).";"2018-12-02T21:45:10-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=950978683&type=Purple%20Software";"950978683";246;"en";"POSITIVE"

You have to constantly bounce back and forth between the menus and options in order to figure out how to make something work correctly. I find myself having to keep adding my cameras into the Live View mode because some other option/function has removed them. Most recently, one of my cameras (camera A) pushes a notification of an event. When I click on that event on my smartphone’s home screen, the app tries to load another one of my camera’s (camera B) recordings. I am then prompted that there is no recording on camera B. I contacted customer support and they had me double-check different settings for camera A. All which turned out to be set correctly. Amcrest prides themselves on having US based customer support, but giving an Indian the name “Dexter”, “Mikey”, “Joanie”, “Trish”, etc. when there clearly is a couple of oceans between America and where their accent places them, does not fool me.

My only complaint and the reason for the star deduction is the lack of macOS web support for their 2018 NVR. I had to do my NVR playback and settings directly from the NVR, remote setup in macOS Safari not supported. Tested this on macOS versions from Sierra through Catalina. As I mentioned earlier, livestream works in iOS but no access to NVR playback. I can see the NVR and do some settings but playback is no show in iOS. Overall this should be 3.5 stars, so I’m being generous with the 4 stars.

We use as a baby cam and it’s woke our son up from naps when it gets in one of its moods. That’s my only real major complaint though. 

 The phone app is also getting much better and they are definitely making strides in improving its reliability. As I said though one big feature needs to be added. 

When you set the camera up you need to make sure it’s either wired or linking to a 2.4ghz signal, it does not support 5ghz which would be a good feature in the future.

Among several other issues, here are the main points of contention: The settings do not specify the effects of changing certain values (e.g. no noticeable changes when altering “Anti-Dither” and “Delay” settings. Another: the camera will not record video and photos to the SD card when prompted by motion. You have to view little bits of video and a very rough playing slide show of photos to see what triggered the recording, then it’s up to users to snag their own screen shots or save the files. Another: as other reviewers have mentioned, you constantly have to bounce back and forth between menus and remember to save every change in order to get the camera working.

There are several other small hiccups that make this app very annoying to attempt to use.

The 1080P resolution and ability to zoom in real time, as well as in playback mode is a plus. 
We also have three Arlo cameras and base station, that while offering an equally exceptional video feed, tend to devour batteries regularly. 
But Amcrest’s wireless configuration, while powered by 12 volts and with greater range, limits your camera locations to within reach of an AC outlet unless you ha a 12 volt feed (we use our 12 volt emergency power source to power the cameras which view the exterior of the house).
Both systems require AC power for their network interface, and since our network hardware is on a UPS, we receive notifications regardless if the power fails. 

  In conclusion, this system gets four stars, only because of the somewhat confusing setup instructions, which in my opinion, lack the detailed information necessary to confidently interpret and understand the software interface, unless you are somewhat “tech savvy”!

This camera and system is of top quality and is built very well. 
After several systems of considerably less quality, Amcrest is a very much welcome and pleasant change of pace, which earns it an overall rating of         FIVE STARS!";"2019-07-16T16:47:50-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=950978683&type=Purple%20Software";"950978683";207;"en";"POSITIVE"

Be prepared for a painful time navigating to access it. EVERY time you leave the playback view, you’re going to have to re-select the cameras and dates. Then, you’ll have to use the inefficient timeline. If you leave it at the default history of 3 days... the green indicators of activities will be impossible to view with the green over gray contrast. So you’ll spend time “zooming” to the timeline which effectively makes the quick scrubbing slow.  If you have gaps between motion alerts (say between 2:10 and 3:00), there’s no forward button to quickly jump to the next motion alert.  You’ll have to manually scrub the timeline to get to 3:00. And since you zoomed in to be able to see the green line, well you may take more time getting to that event than the video itself.";"2018-06-03T09:02:06-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=950978683&type=Purple%20Software";"950978683";157;"en";"POSITIVE"

Push notifications also seem to work once you tweak things for less false alarms. 

Now for the bad: Playback of SD card recordings and images is terrible and is in desperate need of improvement. The timeline control is incredibly awkward and jumps around as you try to use it. The highlighted sections that should show when motion was detected sometimes don’t appear at all, especially if you’re scrolling backwards or forwards more than an hour. There’s no simple list of videos like there is on the desktop version. 

The SD card snapshot viewer is almost comically bad. There is no list of snapshots. You can only choose a 10-minute interval, and the app will just start scrolling through whatever images it finds during that time. Good luck guessing what 10-minute interval you want. 

Overall, the UI is awful. Amcrest, please hire different UX consultants to actually provide a nice user experience.

Fix the UI and make the SD card playback equivalent to the desktop web view, and this app could definitely be a solid Nest competitor.

Inside the “iPad” there is a way to create a “Crate Device Card” which is a mobile to mobile way of transferring the device manager setup.

I have 16 cameras and 6 mobile devices, so it would be helpful if that “Crate Device Card” capability worked on iPhone” too. By the way, I think it’s Supposed to be  “create” device card and someone had a typo when developing the iPad app. 

Can you enter an enhancement request on my behalf. Seems like easy one to dev for iPhone, since the function already exists in iPad. A big time saver when setting up new devices with same 16 cameras.

By far the hardest thing to do is playback. I also use Q-See and their playback is so easy where as Amcrest you have to go through so many steps to play back and that is for one channel, if you want to playback a second channel you do it over again, every time. Just wish they have a complete remodel of the app. And after reading review after review it looks like I’m not alone.

The app needs work. We'll get notification of activity and when we go to check it (on the app) it says there is no recording. The cameras record 24/7 though and we are about to see this on our computer the NVR is connected to; not much use when we're not at home and need to check in. This is fixed by resetting the NVR but again, we need to be home to do that. It happens about once a week. 

The app could also be a little more user friendly. We briefly used Arlo before getting Amcrest and their app was a lot easier to navigate. This one is a bit archaic.
