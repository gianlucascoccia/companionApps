Anyway, this app was quite inferior to the 3rd party apps then available. Unfortunately many of those apps have been orphaned or removed from App Store.

Even when I know cameras are online this app does not always find them. Even when it does find them it may connect for only a few seconds then loses connection. Very very frustrating. Please fix this. There are not any good alternatives that I have found yet, but I will keep looking.  Not sure how you can sell cameras with such a terrible way to view them.  Please make this app connect constantly and stay connected once the connection is made. So far it barely deserves a 1 star rating. Also the app does not give you access to all of the settings for the camera so when set it up you better get it right because changing the settings is not possible outside the network.  

In response to contacting support I have done that and am working with them. So far they have not had any suggestions that have improved the P2P connection. There last solution was the set up a static IP and dens service then set up port forwarding to set the camera up. But this is an internet service that does not provide a WAN, or out side IP address. So I need help making the P2P work. That is why I bought the camera.

I have purchased new Wyze cameras but my five of my six C1 cameras are still up and running for all this time with zero issues. So they are still in use, and the sixth is working too. The app connects all the time, either on WiFi or LTE. Sometimes, if you open other apps after checking your cameras, the Foscam app may not connect (a dead give away is when one or more of your cameras thumbnail previews show the camera as “off”). The solution for all these years, through all the upgrades, has been to force close the app, then reopen. To close the app on gesture-only displays (no circle ‘Home’ button), swipe from the bottom and when the recents open, close Foscam by swiping up. 
For button (fingerprint button), fast double hard click on button, then swipe (not sure if up or sides). Come on. It’s not rocket science! This thing works.";"2020-08-17T02:24:22-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=924381688&type=Purple%20Software";"924381688";168;"en";"POSITIVE"

When the app is closed and reopened, it's impossible to log on to any of the remote cameras.

UPDATED: Per developer recommendation, I uninstalled cameras and app on my iPhone Xs then reinstalled the app and cameras using DDNS rather than IP. Unfortunately, that didn't solve the problem. As an FYI, I have been using IP Camera Viewer for many years to view the same cameras without any problem.

Well guess what, the app does not respect the system settings on my device and even though I turned all notifications off for it the app kept pushing notification sounds every time motion was detected, no banners or badges just sound or vibration if on silent mode which made it very hard to find out what was happening. I can reproduce the behavior even on a factory reset device so the app is doing something fishy to keep itself open. The only way for it to stop giving me notifications is if I turn off background refresh for the app and force close it. I’m report it to apple.

The app is reliable. It doesn’t crash. It adds cameras easily. You can easily upgrade the firmware on your cameras, and foscam does release upgrades from time to time even on older cameras, which is nice. 

The reason I give it three stars is because 1. the interface is not intuitive. 2. My camera has a mini SD card but it doesn’t record based on alerts such as motion or sound. You need to buy cloud recording for that.

I have never seen a such  poor performance in all this time working  with apps and cameras. A camera is totally useless with out the app or software to drive it. This app needs to be deleted from App Store it is a total disaster.
I had played with all setting on the app to compensate I try to copy all the setting from my first camera to this new one and the zoom and focus are deplorable and at night are even worst!! I can not take pictures at all it is very blurry because of the focus that the app controls. This app needs more improvement! FOSCAM is constantly bombarding the screen with their useless cloud service every time that I try to access the camera using  this app is unavailable it takes for ever to load. You get the spinning loading wheel for ever. If you have a memory card installed and you set up the app  to constantly record 24/7 and you want to download a portion of the recorded clip there is no way to just get the small portion that you are interested on because there is no option in this app to download from the camera to your device that you are using to monitor the recording. This app is poorly written needs many improvements the sliders that the app has to allow you to move forward or backwards when viewing the recorded clip do not respond accurately and if you want to see a clip recorded on the memory card you can not download it to you computer this features are only available if you buy their cloud services basically forcing you to buy their services. 
This app should be able to download and record any clip from your camera from your SD card installed in the camera to any device that you are using to control the camera but it does not do that. 
This app is designed to force you to buy their services.
Summarizing. Whenever I use this app I can not control the camera. I am not sure if the app Is not controlling the camera because and night all the pictures are blurry and again. A camera with out an app that can controls the camera  is useless and this seem to be case. I am very disappointment.";"2020-07-02T07:24:11-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=924381688&type=Purple%20Software";"924381688";404;"en";"NEGATIVE"

This app was horrible the first time I tried it about a year or so ago. Nothing worked properly, and I switched to Owler which worked better but never connected outside my WiFi.
Now this app is MUCH better than it was, good functionality improvements - it works very fast inside my WiFi, and also works outside of it (which is the main idea, to be able to monitor remotely).
Why not 4 or 5? The camera overview still only offers snapshot still image rather than slower but still live images. They also cannot be rearranged. OSD displays camera model, not the name as it should, and the OSD timestamp shows the wrong time (not corrected for daylight saving). Also, no control over who can see my cams (I hope my cameras aren't public - where can that be set?) Speaking of Public cameras, why is that even an option - stuff like that should be a separate apps for kids or people with too much time, I'm only interested in seeing my cameras, and that no-one else sees them.

The regarding the app, I can't really tell any difference from update to update, the GUI is the same and I failed to notice any difference in look and/or performance. 

I don't have the issue to login to each camera every time. 

The features I want on the camera that will really make it cool:

- work the detection system so it is closer to what you see when you access the camera from a pc. 

-multi cam view

- have the enriched push notification working correctly. My fi9900 used to send me push notifications with the actual snapshots, in the past months/updates this stopped working now and now I just get the notification but with out the images. 

- be able to choose the sub stream to view the camera, when I'm on LAN, hd quality is fine, when I'm not home I would like to be able to connect through sub stream because my upload speed at home is not good enough to stream HD quality.

The cameras have never worked with Firefox or Chrome for Mac, and Foscam won’t write plugins for them. Prior to the latest firmware, app, and plugin upgrade in the past few days (today is Jan 25, 2019), I was able to get basic camera functionality on my LAN with the R2’s using the Foscam VMS software for Mac, and minimal use with Safari, but it now everything is broken and I know they won’t update the VMS as they haven’t in years and the Safari plugin has never worked well. The app for iPhone did provide basic functionality but now it too is broken. I now have two Foscam R2 doorstops as they are good for nothing else.

Therefore, I can never find out which camera detects motions in notification center. Hence, I must open the application.

There is sometimes only a note above the screen saying “FI9800p detected abnormal motion at 10:00”. I still have to open each camera separately to figure out which one recorded most recently. 

This is such a terrible & confusing user interface. 

Folks! If Arlo works in your country, NEVER hesitate to choose Arlo instead of Foscam!

Did a manual Reset on the Camera using the Reset button/hole on the bottom of the Camera. Nice tune, Camera Rotates and Pans but that's it!
The Camera connects successfully with my Network. But when you go to use/run the Camera from my iPhone Foscam Ap, it asks for the Camera User ID and Password. (It asks for the Password twice.) Then the Ap does nothing and there is no <Enter> Button. However . . . hit the back arrow ""<"" and you get to start all over again. What fun!
Per the bottom of the Camera . . . I used User ID <admin> and for the Password I tried three different Passwords all without success . . .

I'm not going to change my password ... so I will return this useless device.
