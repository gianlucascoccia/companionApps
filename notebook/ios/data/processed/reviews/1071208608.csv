One improvement I would suggest is allowing the user to scale the trendline. Instead of spacing each measurement out equally, I think it would be better to space them out by time. This will allow for a better representation of weight gain/loss. Also, the organization of the functions is a little confusing. It took me a few minutes to understand where everything was located.
