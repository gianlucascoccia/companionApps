The system met and exceeded all of my expectations! I had a little trouble setting it up had to reboot my wireless router for whatever reason but that fixed all my problems. I live in a rental house and wanted something non-permanent for an alarm system. I also wanted to get push notifications to my phone this system does all of that it can even call my phone! Very happy customer!

After the update the app does not sync up with my alarm module. I get lots and I do mean lots of intermittent errors. The app only works about 30% of the time now. Please fix this ASAP!

Latest update: fixed all the bugs I was having. Speed has increased! Great job thank you!";"2015-05-12T06:58:00-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=873901139&type=Purple%20Software";"873901139";130;"en";"POSITIVE"
