Our network is massively better than what it was.  We even have coverage at the back of the yard now.  But there is a glaring oversight in the set up app that is the kind of thing that really bugs me when developers don’t think of possible scenarios.  As you go through set up, there are two instances where the app requires an internet connection.  The new network isn’t set up at this point in the process yet, so that means the app developers have assumed everyone has cell coverage in their homes: I don’t.  So the app just keeps spinning with ‘this should only take a couple minutes’ as it tries to register your account.   

Why do developers not put in contingencies for this sort of thing?  Why does the app not recognize there is no internet connection and prompt you with a ‘We detected no network, so we’ll register your new account after your set up is complete”  message?  I had to unplug the Ethernet cable in the middle of setup, and set up my old router, just to register my new eero system, then unplug it and replug in the eero, which coincidentally confused the heck out of the app, so i had to restart the whole process.  This happened twice before i got it set up.  I realize it’s probably a small amount of users who dont have cell coverage at home, but this sort of oversight for a product of this caliber (and it is great once it’s working) is frustrating.";"2020-09-07T13:07:30-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1023499075&type=Purple%20Software";"1023499075";264;"en";"POSITIVE"

It registered 460Mbps download speed and 35 upload speed all the time and all over the house and yard I even have bars 2 doors down from my house!  It also runs my security wireless cameras flawlessly as well!  Now, I just had VexusFiber install their fiber WiFi and I tell you what its super blazing fast!  It came with the eero mesh system and I left it for a few hours to test it out and it was ok but the range wasn't satisfactory to me so I hooked Ole Orbi back up and it's freakn phenomenal!  It consistently tops out at 420mbps download and get this the upload comes in at the same 420mbps!  I don't know if that has to do with fiber or what but the installation guy said he thought it would throttle down but that's not the case the upload stays on par with the download which is crazy but great!

Setup is easy, but troubleshooting is difficult because the devices don’t offer any user configuration.  You can’t tell if an Eero is working unless you unplug all other Eeros on the network. 

Content filtering (i.e. restricting internet content) is assigned to individual devices, which is great for flexibility but is difficult to administer. Each time a new device connects, you receive a notification. That’s good, but by default the new device receives unfiltered internet access. So when your kid’s friend comes over and connects their phone to WiFi, they have unfiltered access until you open the app, identify their device (which is more difficult than it sounds) and assign it to a profile with certain restrictions. 

Our family of four has about twenty devices connected at a given time, and each child has about 10 friends who connect occasionally. That’s 40 devices to keep track of, and many of them have identical names such as “iPhone”. 

Eero could substantially improve the content filtering process if they would let users sort the list of connected devices by how recently the devices connected. That would make it much easier to identify the new device after receiving a notification. With the app as it exists today, content filtering is a frustrating experience.";"2019-06-02T19:01:05-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1023499075&type=Purple%20Software";"1023499075";217;"en";"POSITIVE"

I recently completed the renovation of a structure that I will call a guest house and a studio. All of the ceilings floors and 80% of the walls are pine wood. The guest house in 1400 sq feet and the Studio is 750 Sq feet. In preparation for this installation I purchased a pro pack and a house installation with two beacons. The Base station in the Pro came up with no issues. Standing on its own in the 1400 sq feet it has dead spots and drops. I tried to install the two units from the pro kit and the base could not find them even placed next to each other. Same thing with the two beacons. I tried to enter the units with serial numbers and some luck but poor placement and no luck finding them after that. I started with the original unit from the cable company and have since purchased a NetGear X45. It reads the 200+ megs from the cable company but can not get past the Eero issues. The Nighthawk cable router modem gives good coverage in and around the guest house but barely twenty feet away in the Studio the coverage is spotty. I have just purchased two range extenders that are compatible with the Nighthawk X45 C7800.

Same story with my phone when I am in my office. My kid’s old iPhone 4 will not connect at all - says unable to connect every time I try. And then there is the flaky app - 2nd day I check the app and it shows no devices on my network and prompts me to add a new device. I tried restarting the app, toggling WiFi on/off, going next to the main eero unit but to no avail - I finally gave up and walked away. Eventually devices came back in the app just to disappear again later and now I don’t know what I will find when I open the app. And now I’m sitting here and already dreading the next forced software update whenever eero chooses to impose it on me.

But on days when there isn’t school the next day (holiday or teach work day) and they are up a bit longer, I would extend time a bit more. So now I either have to turn off the schedule or wait until it starts and allow activity to resume. When I had google WiFi I could just select to delay the start for 30 mins and be good to go. Now I have to manually resume and then pause again when time is up. Something so simple makes a big difference. Another thing is to allow content filtering for devices and not just profiles. I could have devices all in the same profile but not want content filtering on all of the devices.

The app is great for monitoring what devices are connected to your network (it will even notify you when a new device connects!), you can customize your network settings if your so inclined or just let the app walk you through setup if you’re less technical, you can set downtimes for specific devices or groups of devices, and even block devices from connecting entirely. They even added a highly requested feature recently that shows you how much data the various devices on your network are using, super handy if your ISP has data caps.

So first: you need cell service to set up the router. I have cell service, and setting up all 3 only took me a couple minutes and the click of a button. So as long as you have cell service, this is great. Unfortunately I don’t remember seeing anywhere on the box that said you’d need a connection to set up the router. I didn’t see that until I read the setup card inside the box. So this is at the very least some really bad communication on Eero’s part, because a router should have a clearly communicated alternative setup method.

But my actual complaint, for hundreds of dollars on a router system that marketed great security, no asterisks, I wasn’t expecting that the security it boasts about would have to be through a subscription. Thankfully $3 a month doesn’t really break the bank for me, but it’s the principle of the matter. You can’t market something as having built in malware protection and parental controls and not mention it’s at an additional cost. 

Overall the router itself is great, and the app itself is convenient, so it only felt fair to still put 4 stars. But as far as Eero/Amazon goes as a company, primarily in the marketing and communication aspect, I’d absolutely give 1 star and without reading through them all I’m assuming these issues I brought up are what the 1 star reviews are about.";"2021-11-13T00:07:18-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1023499075&type=Purple%20Software";"1023499075";262;"en";"POSITIVE"

No way to delete devices that you no longer own, so I’ve got many old iPhones still assigned to my profile. The daily activity section and live data are locked behind the eero secure paywall, which is ridiculous. And to top it off, the Show Live Data section is terribly unreliable. It often shows no activity at all, no matter how many times you restart the app. And when it is working, it’s slow, and sometimes just stops working. You can’t tap the device and view it’s profile from that live data list either, meaning if you find the problem device and want to go pause it, you have to close the live data list, risking the chance of it not working when you go back to check. This should not be behind a paywall. It’s kind of insane that such a basic router feature is locked away like that. And since I have to pay for such a basic feature, I expect it to work.

Ignore those ratings for comparison purposes; no other Wi-Fi app is anywhere close to the overall excellence of the Eero app. The level of detail provided (Eg., which band a device is using while connected to a particular Eero unit), the ease of use (pretty much flawless), the setup flow, everything. It’s just ridiculously better, and given the current ratings, I almost feel obligated to write this review. They even have labs - really useful beta features that you can toggle on through the app. Currently using Band Steering and Smart Queue Management.

When the network is not working well, the app cannot be trusted. For example, it says “Internet down” on the main screen, but when you click through t says the internet is up and speed test is fast. The reboot status of eero units lags reality (eg lights on base unit goes white for connected status minutes before the app will reflect this). 

When the network is slow through some satellite eero units, the app provides no information to help narrow down the problem. For example, it would be simple and helpful for the app to give a network speed from each satellite unit to the main eero unit. Almost as simple would be to give a  speed test that reports speed from phone to nearest eero unit, though each eero unit in the mesh to the main eero unit and then the internet. This would help to diagnose where slow speeds are occurring. Network topology would be even better for many users.  

All these are needed because the eero mesh is not sufficiently reliable. It is common for speeds to a satellite unit to be 260 Mbps one day and 100 the next. Calling eero support shows that they can see more info. But they don’t often have the time to solve problems completely.

Then I wanted to move nodes around as the first place I put a node said it couldn’t receive a signal at all. This is despite my house being half the size eero Pro claims to support, and also despite putting the node on a hard surface off the ground with no electronics nearby. 
Then I wanted to remove a node so I could put it somewhere else. Wouldn’t do that either. Finally I tried (while right by the connected gateway) to delete the entire network. Nope.

It is a radical redesign.  I’m not particularly keen on the forest green color accents with dark mode.

The app has made internet access and gaming a lot more simpler. I’ve become the Eero Guru at home. I would rate it a 5 star but the app is missing one key feature. 

SUGGESTION: Please allow the user to allocate devices to whichever beacon desired. The system should choose for you, but it should give you the option to kick a user off a beacon. That way it will reduce the stress on a central placed beacon. I have 4 beacons in my house and my family connects to my beacon which is down stairs in the basement. So I have to turn off my PS4, unplug the device, wait for them to connect to a different beacon, then plug it back in and wait for it to load up. Kind of a hassle.

Siri and HomeKit integration is something your Apple customers have been asking for and yet you continue to ignore it. Why?..... The integrations have been simple software changes for a while and are very well documented on Apple’s developer site.

There is no excuse for not having this lever of automation and integration in any app these these days, it is expected.
