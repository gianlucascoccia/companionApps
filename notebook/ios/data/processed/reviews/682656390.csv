The app reports that my refrig consumes 100 watts for 18 hours each day which I believe is true, but the app reports that daily average power consumption is 0.1 kwhr! The correct math would be 1.8kwhrs! And the cost figure is off as a result. Speaking of cost figure, some low $/kwhr is used in the calculation and not representative of New England. It should be adjustable by user.
Also it would be an improvement to use a snapshot photo for a device rather than rely on the few canned photos that do not match a user’s device.

The iDevices home screen and the Apple Home app both use a multi level approach for users to identify the device they want to control. The iDevices app “forgets” this on all menus except the home screen. If I am looking at energy usage, or a scene, I would like to know if a device I named “Lamp”, for example, is in the upstairs bedroom, or the office! My point is, the app should always show the Room, then the device name. Not everyone wants to take a descriptive photo to identify each device. Even if they did, the icons in many lists are so small, it may not help much.  I suggest every list of devices show Room, then Name to help solve this problem.";"2019-12-12T16:07:47-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=682656390&type=Purple%20Software";"682656390";149;"en";"POSITIVE"

I had a bunk router that kept rebooting, and all the switches kept reconnecting automatically with no issues. Great! My only complaint is the physical size of the switches.

Both previous apps allowed landscape and portrait views - this one doesn't - and should. Both previous apps made it far easier to set threshold temps and alarms and work with them once they are reached, this one will do it, but you have to hunt to figure out how. The previous app alarms went off once when the target temp was reached, this app's alarms sound continuously once the target temp is reached then you must select ""no target temp"" to get it to shut off. With the previous versions of this app, the timers, timer alarm sound settings and additional features were FAR easier to access as they made up the whole right hand side of the main screen, the current version's drop down menu is very fiddly and does not allow you to monitor both the timer and chamber/food temps simultaneously. The connectivity is much better with this version though. What this app really needs is to be able to set a high/low range with alarms to indicate if the grill temp goes either higher or lower than the target range. With a range setting, a return to the previous version's screen design and the connectivity of this new version, this would be a PERFECT application for grilling… I do much low and slow"" and much smoking and the concept here is a godsend though iDevices hasn't quite got the execution quite right yet.";"2014-06-07T13:18:06-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=682656390&type=Purple%20Software";"682656390";253;"en";"POSITIVE"

I just purchased an Apple watch which iDevices has an app for... kind of. I was excited to use my watch app with my smoker, so I didnt have to have my iphone right in front of me while I smoked my prime rib. Major problem... the watch app and the iPhone app wont connect. It says ""searching""... then.... ""Connect a device to iPhone app first"". I had my device connected to my phone app the entire time but I could never connect my watch.

 I contacted iDevices via email. They responded very quickly, A+ for that. Told me to ""unpair"" my watch, then connect a iDevice to my iPhone app, then pair my watch and add the iDevices app to my watch , then it should connect. Im sorry but I'm not unpairing my watch from my phone to get this buggy app to connect. I would then have to reset everything, incuding all my other working apps, on my watch again just to pair this one. Who knows if it would actually pair again the next time I cook.

Setting up cook parameters is fiddly and complex. Others have remarked on the poor alarms and disappointing features, notably TROAB - 9 Aug. The app needs MUCH more work. 
Reliability: strong, but the Bluetooth connection can be squirrelly at times. Most of the time, it was solid for me.
Style: excellent. The transmitters are discrete and on the Traeger, the Holland and the Weber, the magnetic mounts are great. On the BGE and the Kamado, not so muc. I used the metal buttons included but they don't stick to the wood bench very well, so I have the transmitters sitting on my bench instead, much less tidy.

On the other App you can chose a GPS fence around your home and tell it that if you enter the zone before sunrise and after dark turn the porch and walk lights on, etc.  Also, the other App allows for some more detailed trigger-based programming of scenes.

One last annoyance: can not access anything in the app unless the device is turned on and the Bluetooth is connected.

Seeing the recent reviews, it's not a difficult decision to switch to a competitor. Prior to my switch dying, I'd experienced problems with every update.

-Over alerting when approaching a threshold: when my smoker or good reached its temperature I have to constantly dismiss the reoccurring alerts or else fumble through the interface to clear the whole setting.

That's all many, many long-time users really want! 

I can't knock this software just because it doesn't do what I like. The original versions of iDevices Connected were buggy but I haven't had any problems for the last few. It has much more versatility than the original software/device pair. I only have the iGrill2 to use with it.

I like the new iGrill2 but the Bluetooth drops more (through metal siding) with the new software and iGrill2 than the original. I also wish that the probe leads came out the top to stay out of my way or how about this - a flippable display?

In terms of the app, it could be simpler. To schedule the switch to turn on/off each day it is one schedule for on and a second schedule for off. It would be simpler to have one schedule with both on/off times. Look at the iHome Smart Plug app - theirs is structured that way and much simpler. 

Finally, to turn off the schedule, it is three screens (4 ""clicks"" in total) in to enable or disable (and then you have to back out). So to disable the on/off schedule that is 8 ""clicks"" in and 6 ""clicks"" out -14 in total !! So make it simpler - you have the power on/off button on the home screen, so add a schedule on/off button (s) on the same home screen.

The Negatives:

You can't change your alert tones, and they are all very subtle and not ALERTING at all. Fortunately for me, my iPhone is jailbroken, so all I needed to do was swap out a .wav file with one of my choosing. I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO RESORT TO THIS.

The Bluetooth is also spotty. I'm not sure if it's the brick walls or what, but after about 15-20 feet it will just disconnect.

You can't reorder the probes in the app. Probe 1 will always be first, Probe 4 will always be last. Keep this in mind when you're placing probes.

The Positives:

Built in recipes
Built in timers
Built in temperatures
Custom peak temperature
Custom temperature range
Sharing temp logs is fast and easy

I gave it a 3/5 because IMO the negatives outweigh the positives. The alarm tone is the single most important feature of the device, and they have yet to correct this. -1 star

1. I was smoking overnight and at midnight the graphs got all messed up. I needed to clear history to get the graphs working again. 

2. Seems only one iDevice can connect at a time. 

3. No horizontal layouts which stinks.  

4. I can't find a way to see previous cooking graphs in the app.

I love them to help me nail a perfect meal from my BBQ but to control my house furnace it wasn't/isn't there yet.

I bought it expecting some features that where advertised but weren't available yet. Things have gotten better fan control and now has a offset to adjust actual room temp to controlling temp.
