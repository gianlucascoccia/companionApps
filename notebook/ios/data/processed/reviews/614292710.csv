Everything works well except the FAT measurement. The FAT bottom is there but doesn't do anything. Besides, where is the app for the iPad? In theory, there is only one app for both iPhone and iPad, but it wouldn't download in the iPad.

The weight measurement is accurate, not so sure about body fat  but at least you get a relative reading and can see if it's going down or not.

The two nits I gave with app is that there is no database export function and the weight graph vertical axis is not scalable. I'm just trying to lose a few pounds and it's hard to see progress with such course scaling. Database export in csv format would be very nice. I'd give it 5 stars if it had that.

Edit 1/7/15
This app crashes when trying to scroll back more that 6 months. It would be nice if it were supported but it's not. I'm buying a different scale.";"2015-11-07T17:39:34-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=614292710&type=Purple%20Software";"614292710";139;"en";"POSITIVE"

The app is okay and at least when you backup your data (inside the app) is saved. Not like Apple health data that gets deleted.
