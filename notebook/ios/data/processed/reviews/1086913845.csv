I have the regular mattress and have been using it for about a year now. I love that I can adjust the temperature to make it warmer (especially in the winter) and that it tracks how well I sleep. There‚Äôs a few suggestions i have for the tracking. During the week I work and my schedule is really consistent (bed time and wake up time) so I would love an option for you to set a bedtime schedule/wake up schedule and that‚Äôll be when the app starts/stops tracking. Often I‚Äôll get a bad score since I‚Äôll be hanging in my room on my bed 2-3 hours before bedtime (I live with 4 roommates so sometimes that‚Äôs the only place I can go to be alone). I know you can edit it, but I feel like a preset schedule would be a lot cooler. My partner and I sleep on our specific sides of the bed, except when I go to work a few hours before he gets up, and he tends to roll to my side of the bed. So then I have to edit that. Which is where the preset wake up time would be great - so it stops recording after 5:30 when I‚Äôm definitely out of bed. 

Anyways, those issues are slightly inconvenient- but not a dealbreaker. And I‚Äôll definitely recommend Eight products to anyone.

Reasons I didn't give this a 5 star rating is because 1. The fact that you have to buy the mattress AND pay that much for an app to actually use the functionality of it is ridiculous.

The user interface is quite intuitive and works well for modulating the bed temperature. 

I endlessly worry every morning if my alarm will go off or not as the alarm remains inconsistent. When you have temperature to help wake you. You will not see the date the alarm is set for. I‚Äôll set an alarm on a given day and when it does not go off the following day it somehow manages to set it for 2 days after I‚Äôve set it. 

The IFTT and ‚Äòsmart home‚Äô uses seem super poor. Why would I want to hit a button on the app to make other automations work. It just seems like wasted tech. I‚Äôm quite sure you could have an automation for getting in and out of bed. I mean the bed is able to sense that is it not? 

...get out of bed, turn on bathroom lights

...get into bed, fade off bedroom lights. 

But no. My only choices are for automation are alarm events (which as stated above are inconsistent) or when I press a button to change between day and night modes which does not feel like automation or ‚Äòsmart‚Äô at all. 

I‚Äôve stated these things to customer service and they just seem to pass blame to the user. Stating my alarm is on silent, or my volume is down...the app literally does not make the action.

Before eight, I could never find anything that didn‚Äôt require pushing a button. 

I backed the original project on the promise of being able to preheat remotely and via ifttt. It absolutely works for that. The ifttt needs work (you have to create new applets for every heat setting and each side of the bed because it can‚Äôt handle something that‚Äôs simple in ifttt, like ‚Äúhey google, preheat $ to #‚Äù), but I can do what I need to. 

The stats are pretty useless. 

I have pets, and they like to sleep on the bed when we‚Äôre out.

So... I still use sleep cycle and my wife wears her Fitbit.

It‚Äôs great that you can preset it to warm your bed up and have all the presets so that you can have whatever settings you want.  As far as temperature control; absolutely wonderful. 

I love the way it tracks my sleep as well. It keeps a good record of whether I am or am not sleeping. It‚Äôs wonderful, great information. 

As far as the new update; that is really nice too. It‚Äôs a little bit more complicated to figure out everything but I like it. The colors are wonderful and it does provide a good variety of information and a nice format.

The option of being able to hook up to all of your coffee machines etc. in the morning is very nice too but I don‚Äôt use that feature.  

I do have a couple of requests: this may not be possible but I‚Äôll ask anyway. 
1) Is there anyway that you can have the whole bed set to track your sleep, instead of each half? I like to sleep in the middle of the bed but to get it to track correctly I have to sleep on one side or the other so I have to change back-and-forth.
2) is there a way I can be notified if the bed is not connected to the hub? Sometimes I accidentally disconnected the bed from the hub when changing the sheets and don‚Äôt realize it until the next morning when I go to check my stats and I don‚Äôt have any üò¢

The data it purports to capture is pretty cool.

Cons:
Crashed on initial setup, so didn't actually start logging until I (by mistake) re-configured the entire thing.
Product lost connection to app, didn't start warming on schedule, which is how I discovered I needed to reconfigure the whole thing from scratch.
Logging is horrifically inaccurate. I got out of bed in the middle of the night, shows I was in deep sleep. 

Smart alarm woke me up at the earliest moment because at that time, it thought I was awake as of 3:59am, so my 5:30 alarm went off at 4:59. Every time I've checked it thereafter, it's pushed back the time it think I woke up by 45 mins or so, to the point where now it thinks I was in deep sleep when the alarm went off and that I actually slept until 6:45. 

I'm going to give it a few more nights. I backed this on Indiegogo the first day it was available (January 2015 I believe, almost 2 years ago) and finally received it a few days ago. I am excited about the possibility, but I'm incredibly frustrated by it's performance so far, given that it's missing the most basic of activities and is incredibly inaccurate in logging.

As others have noted, it's also completely draining my battery. It has my 7+ at 60% by 8am. Force quitting the app stops the drain. For reference, I was previously hitting 60% after a full day of usage around 6:30pm.

What is the point of gathering sleep data only to require me to open the app and tap a button to trigger wake/sleep events? Completely missed the point. The smart alarm needs some work; it routinely goes off when nobody is in the bed, and can't be set to go off on specific days. Alexa integration to set the alarm would be nice as well.

There is currently NO delete capabilities, so if you have pets or someone else taking a nap in your bed (e.g. spouse/significant other taking a nap on your side), there is nothing you can do to get rid of that data and that pretty much screws future sleep analysis data.

A major bug is that this app constantly gives a 400 error when trying to modify existing data.

First, the app will screen darken, I supposed to allow sleep, but there is no way to take it out of that state without going to home screen, shutting it down, and restarting. 

Second, when the alarm turns on, it triggers the native volume window which sits atop the snooze button. Instead of stopping the alarm, the volume goes up or down. Alternately, you can attempt to turn the alarm off by sliding up from the bottom, which brings up the quick menu screen instead of turning the alarm off.

It was fine just the way it was visually, now this new app uses a larger font size, so that many labels/menus/data are cutoff, crowded together, or overlapping. [EDIT] 4/13/18 update fixed font issues!

It took me several minutes to find my nightly sleep data, because of how things have been rearranged (the bottom menu doesn‚Äôt exist anymore, replaced with a sliding up/down menu that lacks the originals Sleep item). This makes it appear that Warming is the default item, which it technically is, just hidden off screen, while the default upper onscreen material is now shows the last 7 days with ‚ÄòMore Stats‚Äô text link being the new way of getting to the familiar nightly vertical timeline. Can you say, awkward? 

Another visual item that changed is the sleep score. Why remove the filled color circle behind the number? Now the score doesn‚Äôt stand out and blends in with the other added info that now pushes the vertical timeline further down the screen on an iPhone 7. 

And lastly, YAY!!! the share data with partner option FINALLY WORKS! (as of the 4/13/18 update, which is a quick replacement of the one released a week or two before, where this bug had still not been fixed ). I have been  waiting for this known bug to be fixed for nearly 8-9 months. THANK YOU, 8!

Other than the above, the pad and base unit have been working relatively fine for 8 months, however our sleep scores are consistently in the 60‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs with a once a week score in the low 80‚Äôs. 

The base unit daily and randomly will blink the white ‚Äútrying to connect‚Äù light for up to 10 min before finally turning purple (connected).  At first I thought this was the unit loosing and establishing connection to my WiFi router, but now I think it means connecting to the 8 Sleep web servers, because my WiFi signal is strong throughout the house and has never ‚Äògone down.‚Äô";"2018-04-14T16:37:24-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1086913845&type=Purple%20Software";"1086913845";342;"en";"POSITIVE"

After watching the videos about how the app works on YouTube, they are different than the updated version as of a month ago, but it‚Äôs easy enough to figure out. It would be nice for a short tutorial run through though. 
The new updates seem to be major, so I‚Äôm lucky we got the mattress after the updates. 
The only thing I would really like to have included is having Eight Sleep as a source in the Apple Health App. I regularly used Pillow as a sleep tracker with my Apple Watch, and it was nice having all the data synced up to the Health app. One change, not necessary for success, but I‚Äôd like to see it in future updates. 
I highly recommend this app.

Edit:  They updated the app with a new home screen, it feels and looks better, and is so much an improvement. The transition from the home screen to the break down of all the details is seamless. I can tell a lot of work and CX design went into this update.

The developer responded to my reviews that they‚Äôre a small company with a new support team so things should be better. On 4/7/18 I FINALLY received an email saying I should send my defective hub back but they‚Äôd send me a new one in a week in the meantime. It‚Äôs been almost two weeks since that email and I have yet to receive a new hub. An updated app won‚Äôt help these problems. Seriously, what other business would ask that you pay almost $500 for a mattress cover then refuse to support their device. My recommendations are to still stay away because this is all just ‚Äòlipstick on a pig.‚Äô Don‚Äôt buy into a pretty app because the underlying hardware is not reliable and the company who built it doesn‚Äôt seem to care at all. 

UPDATED 4/6/18: Horrible customer service. They finally sent me a replacement mattress pad for the original one that stopped working. Go figure... the hub is dead on arrival and only strobes red. Now, no one will return my emails, calls or text messages. I have emailed every day for over a week and no one will respond. STAY AWAY. SERIOUSLY, DON'T GO HERE. 

ORIGINAL POST: The app constantly disconnects from WiFi and is buggy to boot. The app and mattress cover used to work but no more... Sad for an almost $500 investment. I've emailed support and there doesn't seem to be a lot of urgency to fix the issues... or they're just bogged down but a lot of people sharing my experience.

Initially, everything worked without a hitch. Set up and connecting were a snap. The app worked great with accurate data, heat control and smart features. About two months ago, the cover became disconnected from my wifi and I was unable to re-pair the two. Eight replaced the power brick and I was able to reconnect. However, since then, the heating mechanism fails to work and the app records me in bed at all hours of the day, when I am not. I thought it may be recording my dog in the bed while I'm away, but I've kept her out of the room for a week and it still malfunctions. Somewhere along the way, an app update has severly crippled the usefulness of the entire platform. I've submitted a couple of error reports. Mostly, the service I've received from Eight has been flawless, but the entire experience is tied to the performance of the app, and right now it is terrible. Please let us know if there is a fix in the works, because the heating feature alone would be great during this freezing f-ing winter.
