The app has always had intermittent issues but are usually patched pretty quick.  For a while now I‚Äôve been having issues where the app can‚Äôt connect to the internet.  It‚Äôs fine on all other apps but then when I open ezviz it will say it‚Äôs refreshing and just sit there.  I have to completely close the app via the app switcher and then go back and it will load fine.  Also I‚Äôm constantly being asked to login again even though I turned on face id login.  Also the doorbell doesn‚Äôt show a preview.  I‚Äôm sure it will be fixed eventually but still annoying

Other main issue I‚Äôve been waiting on since the beginning is lack of ipad support.  It will run in a compatibility mode but it as I use the ipad in landscape view it doesn‚Äôt rotate items like the login screen requiring me to tilt my head to read the screen.  Oddly enough the rotate works when viewing cameras though.  I think ezviz is missing a big opportunity here as having an ipad with the 2x2 grid of cameras would make a perfect security monitor.

I submitted this question via the app and I haven‚Äôt received an answer as yet.  My other devices or apps do not log out so I know it‚Äôs not a fault with my internet or data plan. Please fix it!

I‚Äôm a little surprised at the ‚Äòtextbook‚Äô response to my concern.  Surely I am aware that in order to use the app, I need to sign in, open it, and keep it running in the background. This isn‚Äôt the first video doorbell or security notification app I am using. I have done all of this.  The issue is after signing into the app and letting it run in the background, the app for no apparent reason signs out and then I have to enter my password again to sign in.  This is a little frustrating because I miss instances when someone rings my doorbell and I‚Äôm not home, someone comes up to my door or gets within the range I have defined.  I am not able to respond on time if I have to sign in my password each time the doorbell rings.

I recently moved and at first I was happy that I didn‚Äôt have to buy any new cameras because I have so many.  Yet, when attempting to set them up I had problems with all except my EZVIZ which I quickly setup within a minute or two without any problems.  

Thinking back over the years how I tended to like the EZVIZ app best of all I used, how the camera just worked and I never had any issues with it, and how the features worked great and were so easy to use, I decided to put all my other cameras into a storage bin and buy more EZVIZ to replace them.  

Got my new cameras.  Once again very quick and effortless setup process.  Cameras are up and working flawlessly.  It‚Äôs great being able to view all the cameras with one app.  Quickly turn on ‚ÄúLeaving Home Mode‚Äù with a push of a button and all the cameras are set to send notifications if they detect any motion.

My only complaint is that their iPad app isn‚Äôt optimized of iPad.  I usually use my phone with works great, but sometimes I like to view on my larger iPad.

A friend is using the same cameras and app and having the same issues. I refuse to pay for the cloud service as during the 30 day trial it had a tendency to pick up a ton of light changes and would sometimes miss actual movement. So overall extremely disappointed in the app and the cameras. Sometimes while I am watching something that is streaming on my TV the app will say I have a poor connection which is baloney obviously.

It should be noted, we only use the cameras when we are gone overnight. When we are home, we unplug the cameras. This can cause an issue with one logging on to the WiFi.

We have three cameras, and have had three issues. If you follow the directions step-by-step, one camera may work quickly and another may be slow to setup. This also occurred when we installed SD cards. One camera may recognize the SD card the first try and another won‚Äôt. We repeated the steps and eventually worked.

1- subscription NOT on the account you will be surprised that each device need a subscription!!

B. Memory card needs format every other day.
C. You have to take memory card out of the cameras and format outside.

Pros: easy install, all equipment included, pretty much idiot proof, average cameras 
Cons: no fast forward/reverse on app, no SD slot on cameras for backup, needs better LED lighting, links to app designer don‚Äôt work

Cons:

From the mixed reviews I read, I believe the success of the cameras largely depends on one's existing wireless network. 

I have an Orbi network that broadcasts both 5 and 2.4 on the same SSID. I expected this to be an issue though it wasn't. Each camera connected to the network and was working in the app within 1 minute. I formatted the SD card, updated firmware and configured the settings for each camera in well under 10 minutes (each.) 

I think the software is great. Sure, there are a couple of enhancements I will request but so far, it's been solid and very functional. I don't use the cloud clips so I ignore that but I haven't found that to be intrusive.  

The cameras records to local SD card and send to cloud only when a camera senses motion though each camera sends to the vault continually. I didn't expect this and found it to be a nice surprise. The app differentiates between continual stream and motion alerts so it's quick and easy to find activity. It's also very simple to export snapshots and clips. 

If they asked me where to improve, I don't believe anything is well documented so I'm still trying to figure out how a few features work.";"2017-06-05T11:51:39-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=886947564&type=Purple%20Software";"886947564";232;"en";"POSITIVE"

This is not a convenient app. My 2 big issues is that there is no easy way to put the camera to sleep from my phone and there's no Apple Watch app. 

First sleep mode - when arriving home I have to open the app, go into settings, then put the camera to sleep. When I don't do this I get a bunch of notifications from the motion sensor. Most times my hands aren't free when I get home so I have to put my things down and clear the notifications , then I can put the camera on sleep mode. There needs to be an easier way like a widget to toggle sleep mode on/off. 

Second Apple Watch app - my phone isn't always next to me but my Watch is always on my wrist. If the camera detects motion and I'm not right there next to my phone (or even looking at it) how will I know that someone is in my place? If I were able to receive the notification on my wrist I would know immediately that there may be an issue. 

Just a couple ways I think the app could be greatly improved but it does what it's supposed to do and the picture is pretty good. This is my first wifi camera so I was just trying it out to see if I would like it. I've decided I like it but I will opt for a different one next time.";"2017-07-31T07:54:16-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=886947564&type=Purple%20Software";"886947564";260;"en";"POSITIVE"

To see an app dedicated to viewing HD security cameras not scale to full screen is, to say the least, annoying.  

I find the entire process of using HIKVision cameras with EZVIZ to be awkward and odd to setup.  1. Enable the feature within the cameras.  
2. Create an account with EZVIZ.  
3. Add each camera using the serial number (only the last 9 digits).
4. Find the device specific password (printed only on the camera body, or SSH to the device (must manually enable) and use ‚ÄòshowKey‚Äô)
5. Login to app.
6. Enter the security key again (oh, you didn‚Äôt write it down? go get the camera off its mount, again (or SSH)).

While the security is nice, using an encryption key that is printed only on the camera body itself is again, annoying‚Ä¶security cameras are mounted in hard to reach locations, away from easy access, and difficult to remove, hopefully.  Then again, EZVIZ isn‚Äôt even touted as a feature of the cameras.  You‚Äôd never know it was for HIKVision cams or supported by the same unless you went out of your way to figure out what the tap was in the cam config).

However, the cons outweigh the pros in my opinion. 

Three major improvements would make this a 5-star app:

1) Make the ability to select part of the camera's view and disable it from motion detection. There are too many false motion triggers from areas of the video screen where repetitive motion occurs (like a road or spinning ceiling fan).

2) Make the ability to DELETE all motion events, not just mark them as read. Scrolling through hundreds of motion triggers 15 at a time takes a long time. 

3) On the playback timeline, instead of just a blue timeline, change the color wherever motion was detected.
