Turned out that humidity must be between 40 and 60 per cent, and mine was too low instead of being too high. Not a big deal, but a good example of how bad UI/UX decisions can cost users money.

I’ve had it for a few weeks now and it’s helped me uncover that my bedroom CO2 levels were getting too high at night. I’ve been sleeping better since learning to leave the door open. Last night with the cold weather I broke out the humidifier and I discovered that my humidifier was spewing huge amounts of dust (pm) in the air and needed more thorough cleaning. The app made it easy to see the correlation between humidity and the PM increase. 

Thank you Awair team! It’s still early days in market for these kinds of home air sensors and I’m excited for what you do from here.

One more thing, if anyone is shopping around ... I previously had tried Flow from PlumeLabs but the app and overall setup was too frustrating so I returned it. The Awair is much better user experience.  Unless you really need a portable sensor like the Flow, stick with the Awair. It’s also not as big as it looks on the web site and it’s as stylish as you could imagine for an air sensor ;)";"2019-11-09T07:44:15-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1034660006&type=Purple%20Software";"1034660006";190;"en";"POSITIVE"

This device helped me to immediately diagnose the issues with my air quality and I've seen the immediate results of taking steps to improve it (cracking open a window when CO2 is too high, getting a humidifier to combat the dry desert climate, etc).

The device looks great and the display on the device itself is pretty easy to understand once you get used to what each of the bars means. I also like how the display can be adjusted to show any of the metrics individually or can be used as a simple clock if desired. I also appreciate the light level adjustment and the sleep mode which would come in handy if using the device in a bedroom.

Additionally, I've found the mobile software to be top notch. I like being able to track trends over time and see the impact of my actions in graph form. Unlike others here I personally haven't had any issues keeping it connected to WiFi, though I understand that would be frustrating.

However the more I used it the less excited I was. The main reason I use this is to monitor air quality in the room with my bird, frankly the concept is game changing. 
My biggest issues are 
1. Triggers for notifications are arbitrary. I'm notified it's cold, well no not really I think it's fine. Same thing with humidity, I'm told it's too moist and mold will grow. I keep it intentionally humid (for the bird). If settings can exist for ""baby"" or ""productivity"" etc it seems I should be able to have a custom threshold. 
2. The trigger for the plug doesn't really work. I've tried 4 different items and unless those items are configured in a particular way they don't kick on. I bought a fancy air purifier, it doesn't power on with the trigger at all. 
3. There used to be a usage indicator for the plug, then it got removed for no reason. I inquired about it and was told it was just removed and ""the awair uses xx amount of energy"" not really an answer, but okay. I would like to track how much energy is used by an item plugged into the awair. A $15 smart plug can do this surely this feature can be reenabled.

1. As of April 2017, Glow still does not support IFTTT recipes like the original Awair.

The app by itself leaves a lot to be desired. I had installed a competitor product at my mother's place and that app is so much more informative. This app was very confusing to me when I first turned it on. It's winter and it's 70° in my apartment which, to me, is very comfortable. The app was giving me an Orange indicator. Why? Which direction does my temperature need to go in? Same with humidity. I grew up in the desert so humidity was never a thought of mine until I go somewhere like New Orleans. So it's 30% humidity, now what? Is it too humid, not humid enough? The CO2 and VOCs seems simple enough, less is better… I think. My mothers app told us what was optimal and had information like CO2 at 1000ppm can make you sleepy and what a normal range should be. This app has none of that. Your best bet is to find green by going one direction or another and try your best to stay inside that range. Another issue is that the Awair team has a medium blog with information like sleeping is optimal at 65° but the app doesn't mirror that and will give you a orange indicator even though I have told the app to optimize for sleep. (Can choose general, sleep, productivity, allergies, and babies as optimization settings). 

So long story short, the app is a good first attempt. Luckily the product seems to work well so far and an app update should make this app the awesome product it should be.  

Side note, the other review was about the app crashing. I had the same issue and asked for help on twitter, they had me delete and re-download the app. This fixed nothing as I was now unable to reach the login server. Later in the day that was fixed but Awair never acknowledged that was their mistake and insinuated it was my end which it clearly wasn't.";"2016-12-29T10:25:48-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1034660006&type=Purple%20Software";"1034660006";349;"en";"POSITIVE"
