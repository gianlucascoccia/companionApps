This machine is invaluable to people who want to or need to live independently. It reminds you to take your medicine....read the reminder or Alexa will tell you the reminder.  It’s a great way to stay in touch with an elderly person. Is Grandma still in her pajamas at 2:00 in the afternoon, not getting out even though she assures you that she’s up and dressed and has walked the dog? This machine allows you to “drop in” and see grandpa taking all of his meds. You can actually “drop in” on a lonely person and eat “together” even while you are in Delaware and your loved one is in Florida if you both have the Alexa Show. To know that an elderly person is exercising, being social, eating regularly, and taking meds......what a relief! Buy an Alexa Show right now so you can get “you and your loved-one” acclimated to the machine before you actually need it... that’s why I picked 60”s as a great age to buy it.  It becomes part of your life and believe me, it is a life-saving tool.  One more thing....it is easy to install and to use. I am not kidding! You will be so grateful that someone invented this machine!

I don’t like the volume control as it blasted as it jumps several volume levels at a time and help destroy my new very expensive speaker system on my stereo which also is hooked to sound our TV. This is bad having Alexa listen to your 3 year old crank up the volume. A lot would have to change for me to ever give it 5 stars. There are some nice features but are outweighed by the bad. Alexa needs more and better Setting Controls and a way to ignore small children who like to change music every 5 seconds.

In the end it’s not even worth it because the next time you run the app it will just re-discover all of the devices that you just spent hours deleting. Also, there’s no easy way to distinguish which of the multiples are the devices you’ve actually set up for routines or rooms. Essentially you have to turn things on and off to see which ones respond before you can determine the ones that need to be removed.

Now it never did this before and to be honest if they have a feature working why can’t it stay working. I’m not sure if Google has that same ability but i’m thinking about switching to Google very soon if this continues. Yes I know technology is frustrating but it’s becoming every time I tell her to stop guarding. Me having to unplug and reset an Alexa every time when it should work normally shouldn’t be the case. Also when you whisper play rain sounds or something a lot of the time she’ll say on the loudest voice okay playing raining sounds. I don’t live alone and people are trying to sleep she should whisper when I whisper and that’s rarely.

The front face of the app doesn’t allow for ease of navigating between starting/stopping the playback of the book or rewinding to catch a missed sentence. Regardless of Alexa’s lack of inflection and intonation (after all, it’s not the audiobook recording of the story and truly is just the monotone of Alexa’s voice), the app glitches enough that she repeats multiple sentences within the same chapter causing me, the “reader” to be throughly confused. Fortunately, but rather time consuming and a bit frustrating, the kindle app holds the “print” version of the book for my own ease in referencing. I’ve had to go back to do that. While I’m not complaining that I actually need to read the book for comprehension purposes thanks to her “glory”, having Alexa read to you that “lives” (as in “he lives for sugar”) not be read as “lives” (as in “he took fifteen lives in the war”) is chuckle-inducing but again, frustrating. She is, of course, a computer. But, as a computer, I figured she should be smarter than that mispronunciation debacle.

Maybe it is because I live in the Apple ecosphere where most things just work. Perhaps it is growing pains with AI, since Siri is Apple’s weakest link. People shouldn’t need an app to learn how to use an app. I also find that I discard most of the skills as fairly useless. I love things like Find My Phone, but a lot of the sleep sounds, etc. are low quality compared to other apps I use. I had to get a new cheap coffee pot for her to control with the plug since she can only work with a toggle, no buttons. I understand why, but wish she could control my Cuisinart. The Show will put up a video I want to watch, but move on before I can ask for it. Asking for it after it isn’t on the screen doesn’t work. My echo used to be very sensitive, but now I have to yell at her several times to turn off an alarm. What’s with that?

This is consistant throught the app. The app is unresponsive. Of course, using voice over takes up some technological resources on my iPhone, however there is no excuse for the latest iPhone and the newest version of iOS that I should have to wait 3 seconds for the next screen to load. Along with that, trying to link services is incredibly difficult and there are a fair amount of buttons, text fields, elements, functions, and even just on/off buttons that just don't work when pressed. Lastly, when putting different gesture inputs into  voice over and doing things in the app, everything starts to slow down after a short amount of time.

~For the Echo Show- When the screen is showing news update/interesting topics, make it easier to use your voice ask her to read or play the video for you and possibly ask her to go back to the previous page in the slideshow without having to touch the screen to scroll back. Every time I see something I want to hear, she tells me something totally different than the news article she was just displaying.

~With the abundance of skills that are out there, I enable so many that sound cool, but by the time I close the app, I totally forgot what the names are and what I have to say to open them.  Why don't you make an option allow people to print out the skills they enabled to use as a cheat sheet? I think it would be cool to make a little book/folder type of thing to keep near the echo that kids or guests can browse through the skills you have and be able to know what phrases they have to say to play the game or whatever.... 

~It would be great if there was a way to have your phone connected to Alexa, WHILE using multi-room music and using Alexa normally, but have her pause the music when you're phone is ringing so you don't miss calls if you're blasting music through the whole house.  As far as I know, if you want be able to hear anything from your phone, then any music or anything has to be done on your phone as well. I want to listen and control everything from Alexa, but just be alerted if my phone rings.";"2020-02-15T19:13:36-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=944011620&type=Purple%20Software";"944011620";286;"en";"POSITIVE"

Once I got my home wifi tweeked to give full reliable coverage for the entire house, Alexa works without issues. 
The app does so many things and it does them well. My wife and I now rely on the echo units for all kinds of automation to run lights, appliances, central air and heat, locks, remote control for TV, cameras and of course music. If things aren't working properly I can always trace issues to wifi.
My only suggestion has to do with using the app for looking up skills. I have issue with the  ""back"" button. After scrolling through volumes off  catagories and skills I wish to return to the place I was so I could continue exploring skills but the ""back"" button returns to the very start of the skills list.

Unfortunately, it makes life easier about 25% of the time and the other 75% of the time, it doesn’t work correctly and I spend this time trying to troubleshoot all of its flaws. In other words, it actually takes much more time and effort fixing all the problems than the efficiency it provides during the times it sometimes works as advertised. 

Side note, to provide a reference of validity:
I’m an intermediate expert at smart home systems with about 60 different smart devices tested in my home and currently running and tested about 45 different routines. I have the best WiFi plan offered in my area plus a $500 WiFi booster - so the WiFi connections are solid. I point this out because I understand WiFi connectivity issues are probably the biggest problem with most people’s smart home systems. But for me, the issues and my rating/review are due to the products and the technical faults and limitations of Alexa software.

The app is a big roadblock in my use of the device. It is too slow compared to other apps. And NO it is not my network or the million other excuses that is usually thrown at you. Bottom-line is that they need to make a better app. 
Also the setup in the app is too simple and is limiting the user experience tremendously. It is like they never consulted anyone with expertise in user-friendliness for real people. If they did - they got ripped off.
Given the share of the market that Alexa devices are currently covering, to have a good app accompanying the devices should be paramount. Clearly not a priority for them - why? Why not be ahead in the game with the app side of things too? 
If I had known how useless and slow this app was I would have opted for google home. I never recommend anyone getting Alexa devices simply because they do not prioritize the user-side of things.

If it does lock up then I can neither mark or delete anything off of it nor can I scroll through to see what else is on my list.

1- have a silent mode for the Alexa devices that can be accessed through the app. This would turn off all acknowledgement sounds the Alexa devices make so whatever is requested through the app can simply happen instead of an alarm happening at a loud volume in a dark room with a baby asleep. This wakes the baby regularly. Simply because of a ding sound. Stupid issue that should be removable. 

2-I need to be able to set certain sounds on repeat through the app rather than the clunky voice commands that want to argue with you at 2am when the rain sound randomly decides to cut off. Every. Night. 

3-have a sound compression or something that can balance the sounds and music that is approved for use in the skills store. For instance rain sounds by sleep jar is significantly louder and fuller than ever other rain sound skill. Wouldn’t be an issue if sleep jar’s rain sound would last through the night. Instead I am stuck setting up two separate devices to creat the rain sound I need for the entire night. When sleep jar goes off the other is on substantially softer. 

Give us control over our devices. Make loop sounds that are actually well made loops instead of a fade out/in ever few hours.

This phenomenon is known as the Fletcher Munson Curve and a loudness switch is usually provided on the high end audio Preamps to provide a gradual increase of base response as the volume is turned down. Just a suggestion to save having to manually turning up the bass in the equalizer when you lower the volume level....At the least please please give us a separate control in the menu to adjust just the Sub Woofer level.

Why wouldn’t Alexa? 

And now, with the latest update, EVERY SINGLE TIME an audiobook is played, it’s followed up with an ad to start an Audible subscription and a sample of another book. We have a shared family plan so the main account logged into Alexa doesn’t have Audible but the connect account does-hence why I’m able to play the books I own.

I raised star from 1 to 3. I’d suggest the team gathers a small test group(s) for specific updates. One could easily test downloading and installing. It would only take ten minutes to get volunteers to confirm updates work.  Such forethought is now mandatory since so many people rely upon Alexa in their daily lives. Also, having a brief communication web page is needed. All of the users who reviewed the app during the outage likely searched for news about Alexa being down. Proactive communication would greatly benefit Alexa reviews and customer satisfaction.

Original Review: I took the day off to install outdoor WiFi lights, WiFi electrical outlets, and much more. Of course, the latest Alexa update has jammed my app - useless.

Vera’s skill gives me the opportunity to control most of the Z Wave devices attached to my Vera.   This includes my Zerbe lights, switches plugs and even Thermostats.  Using Alexa’s groups, I am able to control a WiFi and Z Wave thermostat together which is brilliant. 

I’ve attached other devices like WiFi dimmers and switches and using routines I can control any of the Vera bridged  and WiFi devices  seamlessly. I’m looking forward to adding some ZigBee contact switches using the built in ZigBee bridge in my latest Echo. 

The biggest opportunity is that Vera Control adds motion detectors and contact sensors which are not currently supported. This means that existing Z Wave sensors may not be integrated into Alexa Routines.  After many years of building a ZWave integrated home, I would love to be able to take advantage of the sensors with the Alexa App. 

I’ve added many other useful skills as well but I have to say we get the most use out of Alexa as a voice controller for our home automation.

1) CRUCIAL: when an item is checked off, it should be moved to the bottom of the list, so you can easily see what you still need to get. 
2) it would be nice if it automatically categorized items for you, or allowed you to create categories (like produce, dairy, meats, bulk).

There are constant pop up menus and menus within menus. Using it feels like getting lost in a labyrinth, and the back button only seems to take you deeper. It’s truly dizzying how messy it’s become. It’s my first time using it, and i can sense that it’s just grown via add-ons, tack-ons, slap-ons and forced-ons.

When you press the back button, you have to wait for the previous page to frequently reload, especially managing skills from third-parties. Instead of caching the screen, it literally refreshes the entire list from scratch, and scrolls you to the top of the page instead of taking you back to where you were working.

When you type in more than two or three lines of text, for instance in a review, the keyboard covers the “submit” button. I haven’t seen an app do this since the early days of the iPhone. You literally have to shorten your review in order to submit it, or you have to cancel out entirely.

“Skills and Games” is one menu, and I think Routines is buried in there somewhere. But it’s almost impossible to remember where the Flash Briefing customization screen is.

That only begins to scratch the surface of the dizzying mess that is The Alexa App.

I went “full Alexa” about a year ago and have 5 echos and upwards of 30 bulbs and a further number of outlets, diy controllers and sensors, and misc. connected devices. 

Frankly, the app has a difficult time managing my environment. It lacks what I would call “pro features” and controlling minutiae, which should be simple, are either not enabled or need refinement. I bought a wink hub right before the Echo+ was announced and it helps significantly, though I’d prefer an Echo+ and will eventually migrate to that. 

The app has gained some great enhanced features over the last 6 months, but it needs a serious update or redesign to the UI. Navigating across multiple tabs is slow, cumbersome, and not very intuitive but it’s clear that the developers mean well. Again I’m not slamming the app or developers. This is still new tech and it’s early in the apps lifecycle. 

With so many new releases from the echo family, and the opening up of Alexa voice service for developers, I expect that sooner or later an app redesign will become a priority. When that happens I’ll be very happy!";"2017-11-30T18:11:34-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=944011620&type=Purple%20Software";"944011620";209;"en";"POSITIVE"

For example, I like to listen to breakpoint daily podcasts, not only the breakpoint weekly one. Also a better variety of Christian music stations.
I would’ve rated a 4 for Alexa; however, I have a big problem with Alexa employees listening in to conversations while Alexa is plugged in. I am unsure as to whether or not conversations are listened to while Alexa is broadcasting music, etc. That would be really bad. Anyway, I tend to unplug Alexa when I am not using it. This is a major nuisance. Last week, Alexa asked me (After I had given it a command) if I wanted it to better learn my voice. I of course said no because I really wasn’t sure how much my privacy would be impacted.

It’s complex, but holy cow does it sound amazing.. or.. it used to. 

Because of the variety of components in my setup, the ability to custom fine tune each speaker delay is a MUST. The app used to have this capability, letting you adjust delay timing down to the millisecond. It took some time, but worked like a dream. 

A few weeks ago I noticed my speaker groups were out of sync. I thought an auto firmware update or something reset the customer delay times I had set up, which was annoying, but no biggie. 

To my horror, when I fired up the Alexa app to retime the delays, that setting had been removed, and replaced with a link saying “Audio Sync Problems?” - which only takes you to a page with the ability to mute individual components. No longer can you input custom delay times. *Livid*

This update to the app rendered my carefully tuned home speaker setup nearly unbearable. This is what I get for choosing Alexa ecosystem over the vastly superior Sonos system.

Tip for the developers, animals sounds needs improvement. It’d be cool if when we asked for animals sounds she would just stay in that mode until we ask her to stop. 

Currently, we have to start the command with “Alexa, open animal sounds” then she says her spiel about what we can/can’t do. 

Then, we ask her what animal we want. She gives us what we asked to hear. 

And then we have to go through that same process for each individual animal we want to listen to.

With the introduction of the new Echo units I decided to put them in different rooms, previously I was able to control the playback in other rooms and the volume as well. Now with the newest update all of that is gone just a blank screen with suggestions of how things work but it never shows what is actually shown here on the page for the app which is music volume control and the ability to stop it. I have to actually go into my girls room at night and tell Echo to stop playing music so that it’s not playing in the room all the way through the night. 

I now have over $600 of echo units and I don’t have the ability to control them. I call customer service they give me the same rundown of items to do which has nothing to do with why their app isn’t working and have heard nothing from them in over a week and a half.

The app seems to succeed at its core functionality. 
I’m writing some details, because I really like having it, but want it to be better. 

I use device integration and lists, in conjunction with Echos. That’s about it for this app. I think it wants to be too many things and suffers from scope creep. 

It could be improved in the following areas:
1. Slow startup. Forces you to wait for the UI while it syncs with the cloud data. Could show the UI, let you navigate and refresh once the sync is complete. 

2. Getting to lists is too many taps away. Could order lists with very recent activity to the top. 

3. List CRUD could be better, can’t remember the specifics since it’s blocked by this window. 

4. Web app needs parity with the mobile app. 

5. Home section should just be recent things.  No need for another weather app here. It just slows loading. I have other apps for that.";"2019-11-23T09:27:54-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=944011620&type=Purple%20Software";"944011620";170;"en";"POSITIVE"

But the most important thing about the app that you want to use it for, such as smart home things, it doesn’t do very well because it can’t add the actual skills. This is due to poor app design, because you can’t even search for the skills that you need because the search field is nonfunctional.

Even if you can’t find the skills that she want without searching, it actually never installs or as the scale. So when you go to automatically find a device that you’re trying to add, it just errors out and now you're at square one. NOTHING EVER ADDS

Im using an iPhone X with iOS 12.   I was trying to use my Dyson, hue lights, and Wemo devices that I have all set up in my home, and unfortunately only google home or HomeKit seems to work with any of these devices if they are compatible. The Alexa app is war garbage-town.

Let’s say I want to have my my bedroom lights turn off when I say good night. Let’s say I have 6 bedroom lights. In one area of the app it’s grouped “bedroom”. The routine section there not. So I have to select each light manually and remember which light I selected because I can perform the same action again. This is face palm material when someone like me has 20 lights!

Skills - 

The “ask” function breaks you out of the experience. 

Once you have so many smart devices you have to remember their trigger word. Which is fine when you have 1-3 smart devices. But if you have several you just don’t use that functionality. It would be nice to use common language. “Alexa, set set the oven to 65c”. Not “ Alexa ask genoeva to set the oven to 65c”. 

Scenes -

No idea what these are. Looked it up online and it pointed me to an API. Some simple copy will fix this confusion. This is a 1/4 day fix. 1 story point. Stop being lazy.

I know it is not an internet speed problem as I can play many of the same things...such as Pandora, TuneIn Radio and podcasts from my smartphone without a problem. I have verified that both the Alexa Dot software and the app are updated but still no resolution. If the developer continues to ignore these problems...which have been voiced by many others here...then I think it is worth looking at changing to the Google home system!!  Please fix this!";"2018-05-20T06:03:44-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=944011620&type=Purple%20Software";"944011620";119;"en";"POSITIVE"

She says this any time the connection has been inactive for more than ten minutes and I go to play a new song or video. She also says it randomly. Including in the middle of the night. Brief mode doesn’t work to turn this feature off. Tons of people have complained and they just refuse to create a simple update to turn this stupid disruptive feature off.

It’s been terrible as all my school reminders have been going off all summer at 6:45. One day, Alexa said she was not logged in so this gave me the idea to deleted the app and then reinstalled it. Once I logged back in everything was back to working again on the app. So if you have this problem, try this fix and hopefully this will fix yours too.";"2021-08-07T04:02:09-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=944011620&type=Purple%20Software";"944011620";82;"en";"NEGATIVE"

However, if I try to play music from my Apple Music, it tells me to connect Apple Music to Alexa using the app. I’ve done this probably hundreds of times now over the course of months and still the only way I can play music is if I connect my phone using Bluetooth and use Alexa as a speaker rather than the smart device it is.

Selecting one echo turns off all others. Followed all problem solving, issues still exist. Reset all my echos, rebooted router and still useless to have more than one echo and expect music to play on all or a few grouped together.

Additionally, try controlling the volume through the app - you’ll see that it is possessed. Then it down a notch, it ratchet up 2 volumes higher. In fact, moving it up or down, it fights you and moves in the opposite direction by itself.

Reason why Sonos exists. Expecting these devices to act as such coupled with this latent responsive app is a recipe for disaster or “return all” at best....";"2019-12-21T04:12:45-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=944011620&type=Purple%20Software";"944011620";122;"en";"NEGATIVE"
