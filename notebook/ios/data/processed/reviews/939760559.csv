An apps feedback doesn’t go from roughly 2 stars for the better part of five years to where it’s now unless there are major improvements or users being paid to give fake feedback. And I can tell you the first part hasn’t happened. Even after all these years, I experience more problems with the app. Even recently, I click to watch a video that may or may not have triggered a notification and cannot tag, share, or bookmark said video. This has been an issue from the start. The icons are there but they’re ghosting me. So now with the ever increasing stresses we have in the world, I have to worry about an app ghosting me nevermind a tinder date. Take your $100 gift card and shove it.

I have always thought it would be nice to have some kind of home security system. But as a renter it just wasn't worth the cost or time of installation. This really solves that problem. Also love the fact that it monitors temp, humidity and air quality. One thing that I would like to see though is automatic alerts for change in temp or air quality. Also would be nice to be able to export video clips in case there was something that you wanted to save like the dog doing stupid stuff or in the case of an actual crime being able to save evidence for police or insurance. I understand that's what the premium storage plans are for but some options for those of us who aren't going to subscribe would be great.

No other devices I own experience disconnection issues, and this is on a daily basis. (And I made canary aware of it multiple times.) I just tried to set the cameras up again tonight and they lost connection 3 seconds after they (finally) connected. We tried them in the same room as the wifi router as well as other rooms on different floors, went through all of the trouble shooting available on Canary’s site multiple times, but they simply will not connect to our wifi now (and they are not blocked from it). After two hours of trying and a completely unavailable customer service contact (the message from customer support literally says “you will receive a response if [canary determines that] a response is necessary”) we gave up. Throwing the cameras away. They are useless.

My response is : No. I have contacted support multiple times on multiple occasions of these devices disconnecting multiple times a day on a daily basis (regardless of location/building - apartment or house, close and slightly distant wifi proximity, fast internet speed, checking for blocks, ensuring proper channels and that it’s not blocked from any whitelisting of devices, etc.).

I like the way it now puts a little square around where the motion is so I know it’s just the heater moving the curtains, or just the wind blowing the trees outside.   When we have renters at our cabin it’s easy to take the indoor camera out while they’re there, put it back in when gone.   We have Ring cameras on the outside that are permanently installed, no easy way to disconnect temporarily.  Will continue to use our Canaries because for us they do exactly what is needed.  

Previous post:

We have had our canaries for almost two years I think?   Yes, we were extremely unhappy when they pulled the rug from under us and took away free features we used to have.  They know it was a huge mistake...fortunately I now see 30 seconds of video when motion is triggered, for 24 hours, which is better than what I had before (it was 12 hours per device previously).   This is free, no monthly charge.  I don’t understand the reviews that say they are not recording videos when motion is triggered because mine do.  Complain all you want but you won’t find a better deal with any other security camera.  I’ll keep using my canaries (for live views and motion triggered notifications and videos) until this free service goes away.   Then I’ll look into something like Nest, but hoping it won’t come to that.";"2018-02-28T01:25:35-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=939760559&type=Purple%20Software";"939760559";252;"en";"POSITIVE"

I am now in a continuous never ending loop where I download the latest compatible version only to be told to again load the latest version of the app.  When I finally got through to their customer service I was told my IPad could no longer be used since it made my Canary insecure in that someone could hack into it and view what is on the camera.  I told customer service I didn't care who saw the image since I only use the camera when I go on vacation and all it views is my front door.  I ask the customer service person how can I download the previous compatible version albeit ""non-secure"" version of the app so I can again use my bought and paid for Canary.  I was told there was no way for me to do that and instead I had to buy a new IPad.   Could you believe this?  Stay away from Canary.

When selecting arming modes or much of anything from the application’s home screen, it seems to take a bit of screwing around to get back to the home screen of the app. The video has looked good over wifi and LTE. I’m not quite sure what the posts within an app are suppose to do, and when identifying movement of a video, I used other to put in a new category, it would be nice to see this new category continued as an on-going option as I keep getting the same thing again and again. Looking forward to the next update and I think there is a lot of potential. Lastly, with the geofence, I am worried about the battery life on my phone 6.

Been using the app for over a year, it’s usually been good but this last update (July 2019) has made my cameras almost worthless as I can’t control them half the time anymore.  It’s so buggy now like if I’m home for example and try to switch to night mode so I have them on when I go to bed, it just flickers the mode status icon and stays in home mode.  LUCKILY the time schedule seems to still work so I use that to switch it right now but obviously you should be able to switch modes manually if you want like you used to.  Also, over half the time now if I come home, it doesn’t switch to home mode anymore.  If I open the app THEN quit and reopen it, it finally sees I’m home and shuts off the cameras.  Didn’t used to have to do any of this til this last update.  The app seems to be crashing more often now too when it first opens.  I’ve uninstalled it, signed out and in, even tried it on my separate work iPhone (which didn’t have it before), same exact issues. I pay for the subscription but if the app doesn’t work half the time I may not renew when it ends this month.

It is been a great source of security for us both when away and home. While away, it would record any movement or sound and send me a text message whether I was at work, the store, or across the world. It’s also a great monitor if I want to keep an eye on my kid from another room, being able to see and hear what he’s doing, playing or watching. We would also occasionally use it for making funny videos, having conversations remotely, and even “checking the tape” to confirm what someone had said earlier in the day. The camera quality is great, with a perfect field of view for our needs. It’s an attractive piece of hardware. Sure the app left a lot to be desired, but it was serviceable and I had no complaints.

Until today, that is. I decided to do some research as to why I was not getting text messages lately from the camera. The live view seems to work fine, but my history was empty.

And Two as with my other security cameras and they give the option of all at once select and delete. This may require a redesign but would be very beneficial in using these cameras.

I don’t pay for any other system and I use three including Canary. I read that also has been addressed by other reviewers.

We've been using a Canary for over 2 years now. When we first got it, we could see our cat everytime she entered the room. After abot a year we began to see her less and less on recorded videos. I contacted Canary about this, to which they replied that they've changed the software to ignore certain repetative motion such as pets (even though they're advertising it as a pet monitor!!!!???) and that I should set the sensitivity higher to see more videos. The sensitivity is as high as it can be and we still do not see about half of the videos of our cat in the living room as when she actually is. We know this because we are away often for work and check on her often and see her walking around, yet no videos are posted. Canary specifically told us they were actively reducing the frequency of pet videos and now they’re advertising it as a pet monitoring system. I really think this is wrong. We also have some connection issues over wifi with the units being within 10 feet of open air in our livingroom to an expensive, well built wifi router.

What other UI employs a “bounce” effect for video? It makes no sense, and causes accidental exiting of the screen. Because video streams from the cloud each time it is opened, you have to buffer all over again and you lose your place. Because of this streaming situation, you have to “request” a download from the cloud which results in an extremely small video file with high levels of compression, and it doesn’t even save to your photos! So you have to text or email it to yourself just to watch the clip again offline... bizarre, right?

The hardware is excellent but the UI/UX is a nightmare. Please fix, it would take very little time to turn this around!

UPDATE: With the latest release, Canary is trying to re-monetize paid customers by forcing them onto paid plans. This contradicts their marketed freemium value proposition, which WAS true until now.

The time from opening the app to getting to seeing a clear video is roughly 7 seconds on a good day which is most of the time but sometimes the feed won’t load for a good 20 - 30 seconds which is really annoying because at that point it makes you wonder why you spend so much money on the cameras; sometimes the feed will never load.

The app has this annoying feature where if you have a table or phone in landscape mode, the app forces portrait but then when the video loads, it can be in landscape... but if you want to change your volume or brightness for example by using the Control Center via swipe, the app forces portrait mode again... only to go back to landscape when the video is back on... SUPER ANNOYING!!!!!

The cameras are very high quality. It can get to 0 degrees where i live on a cold winter day and the cameras have no issues being outside. 

Overall I’m happy with the product apart from the aforementioned items but I think I would seriously research alternatives if I had to re-do the cameras around my house.

On top of that - expect the company to completely change your feature lineup and service plan terms every couple of years. They just did it again in April 2021. Their business model must be crap if they need to keep raising prices and putting features behind a paywall. Imagine if someone like Verizon just arbitrarily decides to raise the price on your existing plan, instead of only applying rate changes to new users and grandfathering in the rest? Yea - not good. Just because you can legally change the service terms of current users doesn't mean you should Canary.

Features that would be cool:
- Ability to access and download videos via web (supposedly working on this according to their FAQ)
- Ability to have geofencing switch to privacy when arriving home vs just disarmed mode
- Schedule times to switch into disarmed/armed modes (to allow programming in to/out of recording vs privacy at night).

When I reported the same results (no hear), canary tech support suddenly went silent.  I responded 8 days ago, as well as a resend yesterday, and they are refusing to respond further.  At this point I can't recommend either the hardware or the software.

My canary view cam got stuck in an update mode and has become absolutely useless. Need help...oh well.

Well..did you know that when it’s plugged in there’s a large circle light that appears on the face of the camera?! Yes! Half of their selling points are based on the idea of stealth monitoring but then they design the thing to light up like a spotlight while plugged in. Of course you can use it a few hours without it plugged in but then a light flashes when it senses motion! I SAID A LIGHT FLASHES WHEN IT SENSES MOTION.

The app never properly detects when I get home even when I have my location services ""Always On"". There is definitely a delay and this triggers false notifications being sent to me. It would be nice if it was a ""Welcome Home"" notification instead, but it just thinks I'm not home still. Also, because the app is always on tracking my location, it really drains my phone battery. I think this needs to be fixed. There should be a better way (more accurate and more efficient) to detect if I'm home or not (maybe detect if my phone joins my home wifi or something like that).

The user interface of the app can also be improved. In the beginning I wanted to edit my different settings but it always just ended up switching my Canary's mode instead.

Also it would be nice if there was a way to make my canary notifications a different sound/vibration then the rest of my phone's text/notification sounds. This way I will know that it is urgent and I should check my Canary app. 

Automatic siren trigger feature when activity is detected should also be an option.  Of course this has to be after location tracking for mode switching from away to home is near 100% accurate.

Mine arrived in late January. Set up was simple and easy (pros hooked up my Panasonic and Samsung… both now paper weights). The Canary worked well for the first week then the problems.

Numerous “server outages” and app problems. A firmware update seemed to put me back in good shape and then reliability problems happened again. 

The Canary has a “learn” mode to instruct it to ignore certain movement (such as pets, etc) and I spent a good deal of time “teaching” Canary but I think the big server malfunction of 3-24 lost al my data. 

The new app released soon after seems to resolve a lot of the problems, however I am don’t know why the Canary is arming itself without me going though the app on my iPhone.

""Home"" mode is an ""all or nothing"" proposition and night mode isn't even accessible. What's next Canary? Are we going to have to sign up just to see video soon?? Of course, you can pay their ransom and have the devices you previously payed hundreds of dollars for returned to their previous functionality. Convenient indeed! But I digress.

The cameras are very clear even at night when it’s dark! The system will alert you when there’s any movement in the home and it has great features when you attach it to your mobile device. I pay less than $10 and I can hook several cameras to my account. 
I travel quite often and having the system gives me peace of mind; I can check in on my family and my house at anytime I can  listen in and talk to the family through the system too.
The Canary is not hard wired so I can plug it in and move at anytime. The sIren feature is great because it is loud and quite frightening when you sound it (it would deter any intruder). Great system!

The camera itself takes a reasonably good quality video and also records sound. It also has pretty good night vision. 

Now the reason for the 1 star review. If you sign up for a subscription service you can't go back to the free option unless you email their support team.

WAY smaller than I thought it was going to be. Super easy to hide away so its not super obvious what it is. The design is nice too. It doesn't look totally out of place. I also like the indicator light on the bottom so you know if its on or not if your phone isn't super cool.

The quality of the camera exceeded my expectations. I can't believe it can get our whole apartment with just one canary. I live  in a one bedroom so it's not huge but the wide angle is great. Also the fact that they have night vision is really cool!

It's a shame because the device itself is very sleek and aesthetically appealing. It blends nicely into the background and video is clear, even in low light.
Biggest cons on the app seem to be software related, which is surprising given the delayed rollout date and user testing that occurred.
- geofencing still not 100%. There is a delay in the recognition of when users leave/come home. As a result, it is easier to just arm and disarm manually
- interface for arming/disarming. When you select the option for setting the mode on the Canary, a pop up box opens. Unfortunately on my iPad, the circle for privacy mode overlaps another option,  the option for other user. As such I cannot select Privacy Mode as I am always kicked out to the option for Other User. This is not an issue on our iPhone. I wish the app would auto-rotate which should resolve the issue, or open a more vertical pop up box.
- alerting features not 100%. I adjusted the settings on both of our devices per the Canary instructions but alerts are still not coming over consistently. Sometimes we get the notification, sometimes we don't.

I don’t feel secure with this device anymore because they’ve taken away “Night mode” for the free users. So basically if you’re home it does not record period. 

I use to enjoy the peace of mind I had knowing that if someone were to break in at night it would be recorded but now that that feature has been taken away. I really want to sell this device and find something better only.... 

I have no idea who would buy this device with the lack of features.

Also the free users used to have 2-3 days of recordings and now they’ve limited to 24 hours. 

How do you screw up so badly canary. 

This device used to be a great device without a subscription and now it’s really shameful what you’ve done to make a little more money. 

If it’s having a big use base that doesn’t subscribe that is the issue... reengineer the device to have local storage to make it auto sufficient and not use your servers. If it cost money for that upgrade I’ll surely pay it to keep you from having to buy a subscription.

- App almost never auto-arms. I can open the app away or at home and it's almost always incorrect about my location. I need to force quit the app to make it detect my location. 
- ""Home Health"" data works the same way. I often need to force quit the app to make it update the stats. 
- No historical home health data. You get 24 hours, that it. No way to actually see trends with 24 hour's worth of data. Also no way to export the data. 
- No way to export videos. I can see them wanting to store the data on their servers so they can charge you, but individual videos should be downloadable. What if you actually had to give the videos to law enforcement. 
- IR night vision triggers the motion sensor. I get an activity alert every time the sun goes down when the IR lights turn for night vision. 

Also, not a down side, but it would be great if you could get some kind of notifications when temp/humidity/air quality changes drastically or at an interval you set.

Shuts off when the person gets out or shortly after they get out.

I have these cameras at my office and the same thing is happening.  Will catch the movement then stop recording while the person is mid-step in front of the camera.

Well, now the talk feature is finally here but you want your customers to pay for a feature that is free on cameras costing as little as $29 and probably less.

When the camera is not plugged in it is worthless. I had so many videos of the back of peoples heads. They would come to my door and by the time they were leaving the camera kicks in. Hope people can be identified by the back of their head. 

The ""solution"" was to plug the camera in. ... So much for ""wireless"".  I ended up plugging it in inside pointing out a window. ... Weatherproof no longer needed. The reasons why I chose to do this. 1. The weatherproof plug does not come with the camera. 2. The easiest way to remove the camera from the ""secure"" mount is to simply unscrew the camera from the mount. ...no hex wrench or tiny hex screwdriver necessary. 

Still a 10 second delay, even after this latest ""update"". 

The camera is largely a failure. The battery option is useless. After paying hundreds of dollars they still want to nickle and dime you. The only thing I will be paying for is return shipping.

Now the last few weeks have been a notification nightmare, rendering the device completely useless. Even with timer and geofence and manual settings, the app will not recognize I’m at “Home”. Constantly leaves me on “Away”, despite manually selecting “Home”. So every time I move out of my set mask, I get notified.

Turn off notifications, which would mean I wouldn’t know if there’s an emergency. 3. Turn off the app/device. Also rendering the system useless. 

Tl;dr- before all these updates and “monthly monitoring” pop ups, the app and camera were perfect. In 6 months it went to hell. Save yourself the money and time and buy an Arlo or Dropcam/Nest.

Thankfully: this was not an intruder but a plumber my landlord had sent in to perform a repair. The only reason I noticed the recorded video was I had expected them to enter and was interested in seeing whether or not I would be notified.

- adding insult to injury, Canary added a requirement that you subscribe to their paid member services to download even a single video. For the first year or so you had a basic membership (which only makes since, having paid for their $300 camera). Apparently they’ve decided to stop doing this.

A few fatal issues hold Canary back.

- Support. It’s bad. Days to reply. Short and terse replies that don’t address the issue. Canned replies that obviously have been tried that don’t address anything the customer is saying. No desire to hear feedback or address complaints. All I ask for is “thank you, sorry, we’re working on it, and here’s an ETA. Let us keep you posted.” This, with a paid annual plan on top of 3 cameras.

- In cold weather the camera gets finicky. In colder weather, it works sporadically, if at all. As advertised, it should work in as low as negative 4. Nope. Starts having problems around 20 deg F.

- No masks. Unlike their older model, which I’ve had for 4 years, the new flagship doesn’t let you monitor only a specific area of the frame. If you live in an urban environment, you will receive false notifications and near constant recording.

- Bad Business. Pulling the plug on legacy free users who bought their product advertising full recording capabilities completely free for life.

PROS:
  - Intuitive interface had me up and running in a few minutes. 
  - Location-based auto disable works perfectly! (This one is iffy at best on my Dropcam Pro)
  - Camera quality is fantastic. The video is crystal clear and the wide angle lens captures the whole room. Night vision works amazingly well too!
  - The alarm is REALLY loud. 
  - Option to call local authorities / emergency services directly from app is a nice addition. 
  - Environmental monitoring works better than some of the standalone units I've tried in the past. 

CONS:
  - The night vision mode doesn't always turn off. This means black and white video during the day sometimes. 
  - New alerts aren't always available to view on the app until you are on wifi. 
  - Occasional ""user unauthorized"" errors are annoying.

First when testing, it took minutes to send me a notification. The burglar would have been gone. When I tapped to view the event I also just got a spinning icon that never went to the event. That said it was easy to just go to it manually. 

The one thing that bothers me is the glowing light on the bottom of the device. When a burglar is in my house I want my security device to be as invisible as possible. A glowing light draws attention to it as an electronic device which is likely what they are trying to steal anyway. It would be more logical to have the light OFF when in Armed mode rather than broadcasting a green light to the intruder.  Stealth is your friend when it comes to video cameras. Don't tip off the location with lighting. 

Lastly, the live feed flickers off and on before finally staying on. Lag time was about 10 seconds or so. The quality of the picture is very good.

I really wanted this product to work as the website describes it. My experience thus far however is quite different. 
My canary is perched an honest 10 inches away from our home wifi router. 
Downloaded the throughput app suggested and checked our DSL service speed. I don't have the figures but suffice to say it's not the cause of our canary problems. 
Here's what the unit does and doesn't do. 
Does give the ability to remotely monitor the temperature. 
Does allow remote activation of alarm. 
Does not send video remotely. 
Does not send audio remotely. 

It's now unplugged on a shelf. All but forgotten until this update showed on my phone. 
No more early adopter for me.

Years later follow up. Has service improved? Not a bit. Their latest app update won’t even download. Imagine a device who’s reviews were so terrible it removed stars from other reviews! 
Buggy inconsistent operation. Sometimes I’ll receive an alert only to find the Canary won’t allow me live view!

Until they suddenly changed the terms of their free plan. Now, I see 10-second “summaries” (this means the first 10 seconds of whatever activity occurs) of activity, which is for my purposes useless. The only solution Canary provides is the “option” to pay $10/month for the “upgrade” that restores removed functionality.

Original review:
I purchased 2 Canaries at first, then 3 weeks later bought one more.

Installation and tutorial excellent.

Video quality viewing on iPhone is excellent.

Responsiveness and speed flipping views between Canaries good.  Takes about 4 seconds.

Sensitivity controls for each camera excellent.

Ability to quickly and routinely asses if I am home or not is excellent.

Multiple iPhones accessing these and never an issue.

I have ideas for feature enhancements but this does everything they claim it will and it foes it very well.

Recommended it to coworkers and several have purchased it.";"2016-11-04T17:37:34-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=939760559&type=Purple%20Software";"939760559";178;"en";"POSITIVE"

Well, I have had enough of toying with the toy.  I have thrown this Canary in the trash.  I am tired of tinkering with this junk.

With this shoddy performance, I am also very worried about the security of the camera seeing everything in my home.  I don't want unpredictable junk with a camera in my house.  I feel more secure with it in the trash.   Not likely to buy into start up efforts any more.  Oh and by the way, the support is a joke.  Buyer beware.

They rebilled me, I emailed to complain. Informed they could cancel membership going forward but not refund. I explained that I tried to cancel - and then despite what their emails had said and what their customer rep had literally written two lines before - You cannot cancel on the website.

Somewhere night mode was activated and set to 12:01 PM to 6:01 AM (16 hours!!)...not (intentionally) by me, but set up is so unuser friendly, who knows?
Have contracted Canary through cumbersome text/chat thingy that is sub par. 
All I want is for Canary to notify me when someone is in my house when my wife and I are gone. It used to do that just fine. 
Can’t imagine paying a subscription fee for this service.";"2018-10-11T06:22:06-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=939760559&type=Purple%20Software";"939760559";167;"en";"POSITIVE"

Update NOV 2: 👍🏼

I received the news mail from the CEO and I’m happy to see that they are bringing back the functions they previously removed from the basic plan, in my opinion the hardware and the app are ok but the delay in the notification time must be improved (it takes like 3-5 minutes to alert me).";"2017-11-02T13:45:01-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=939760559&type=Purple%20Software";"939760559";86;"en";"POSITIVE"

Nowhere in the documentation at purchase time did it say after 1 year of free home and night mode monitoring- that one would have to buy a subscription service to keep that monitoring going.  So I give Canary Zero out of 5 stars since this purchase has become a total waste of money. In fact now I view it as a possible privacy concern only.  I would recommend a different security service if you plan to pay for one.";"2017-10-20T07:49:48-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=939760559&type=Purple%20Software";"939760559";110;"en";"POSITIVE"

It is performing more poorly now then ever.  It was pretty reliable before, but not enough for me to replace my alarm panel monitoring with what Canary is offering.

If they can provide supervision on the connection that isn’t a Canary issue vs. real network issue, and fix app crashing concerns I might consider it.

I do like what the Canary offers with video and other telemetry information.  So keep working on improving it, and you may get my monitoring.";"2020-11-29T13:45:54-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=939760559&type=Purple%20Software";"939760559";86;"en";"POSITIVE"
