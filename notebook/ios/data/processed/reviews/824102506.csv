It should not have to be a process to turn on/off the lights in my house. Having a Siri function would make things a lot quicker and easier.

There are some other things that could use attention as well.

Help me fix these things and maybe answer the question around the blacklight, and I'll bump up the rating.

However, when I want to sync my music to my light, I'm at a disadvantage, because I don't use iTunes for my music. So I am suggesting updating the app, and allowing people to use spotify or other third party music applications for their lights.

Please fix. Add Spotify and soundcloud integration please. Add more control over eq (presets are lacking). Add an alarm that slowly brightens. Add remote on/off function. Please fix original features that attracted me to this product, really enjoyed before recent updates. Then add my suggestions please. Going to look around for alternatives. Have seen other light bulbs that claim to surpass these. Just want what I'd gotten used to and what was advertised. No good reason to take away features.

This was perfect, red for early morning hours, yellow for <30 minutes, then the much anticipated, green! And yes, this bulb + app support this 100%

But there’s a catch.  Close the app & turn off the power to bulb (remember, it’s in a kids room, either on a switch OR plugged in), and ALL timer information is lost and you’re expected to start over.  It fails to save state.  And forget multi device (e.g. my wife) support. 

All in all, it’s an great gimmick bulb.  But the app needs a lot of polish.  First time user experience is rough, and it’s primary use case expects you to own many of these products and to set into groups.  Somehow, I expect that 95% or more of customers own only 1, so I’m not sure why such heavy focus on groups.

Anyways, fix the timer support, and maybe it gets a three.  Polish the app, and maybe three.five.  But as long as the companion bulb LOSES all settings every time it loses physical power, this device will never be ready for “mission critical” applications (think: security, children), which I feel is where a 4.0 rating starts.";"2015-04-12T19:18:20-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=824102506&type=Purple%20Software";"824102506";210;"en";"POSITIVE"
