Didn’t receive any notifications. Opened the app when I discovered the leak on my own. Sure enough, sensors showed there was a leak, and they were supposed to alert me by alert, text, and email, but nothing was sent. Tried testing my intentionally getting the sensors wet (no other way to test) and still nothing. Also, the sensors periodically just go offline but the app doesn’t alert me to that. And when the sensors do go offline they have to be unplugged to reset, which makes them useless for monitoring in a remote location. All told, water sensors and app are mostly useless. I’ve had better luck with the dLink Lite camera app – it’s slow and clunky but at least it works.

This device (water sensor) and its app took 4 valuable hr to install, in contrast to 15 min for the other automation devices/apps. Worst of all, the app tells us no way to test whether the device is working--without dousing it.  Next, took three tries to connect to wifi, even though I connected while 1 meter from router.  Next: app won't run in portrait, and had to spend more valuable time learning that. Your typical homeowner installs automation to save time. This device, and this app, do the opposite. Despite wirecutter opinion.

Hoping to exploit previous knowledge, I got, and connected, a second copy of the same device, in a different location. Same connection woes, both wps and manual.

I connected 2 of the simpler DSP-W110, and talked to them using iOS 6 and iOS 8. WPS installation was flaky, but that's the fault of Apple's Airport Utility. Manual setup worked fine.

First there is dlink's confusing multiple apps approach; do I use their smartplug app or their myhome app? Both have similar but not identical functionality.  That's after wading through their various cam focused apps, to even find the ones that are relevant to the smart plugs - please reconsider and simplify to a small number of apps at some point (ideally just a single app).
However my main gripe now is crashes. Whenever I try to set up / adjust a schedule for a plug, the app crashes...
Also, as noted by a prior reviewer, the notification feature does not appear to work yet.
Lots of potential, but needs continued development - hopefully it will become a powerful and simple tool at some point.
The interface is clean, and it is easy to set up (basic) rules. The hardware is easy to set up, and so far seems to work well. Hopefully they will fix the current app and add more features and flexibility over time (eg, I can set a plug to turn on when the motion sensor detects activity, but no way to turn it off - you could have an option to trigger after a certain length of inactivity).";"2014-07-30T06:14:12-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=888259383&type=Purple%20Software";"888259383";209;"en";"POSITIVE"

I've never had the indicator not match reality. (I.e. App say light is on when it's really off). It knows if the touch doesn't work. 
I particularly like the scheduling feature. I have my lights on timers. 

Firmware updates on the outlets worked fine, as I was on my home wifi network. Be sure you're connected to same network when updating the software. 

Cameras don't work with this app (even though they show up). You have to use mydlink light.

One recommendation: customize push notification options. I turn them off completely because there are too many motion detection events from my cats on the cameras (even though you can't use the cameras with the app).

190;1210107413;"DaleBarton";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id24619523";"2.2.0";3;"So many missed opportunities";"I bought a smart plug to use as a power monitor; it requires this app. After creating a d-link account and configuring the plug to connect to your wifi, the app allows you to turn off and on the plug, create a schedule, monitor power usage, and set up conditions for the plug to turn off and on. You're probably thinking that sounds amazing; I was too. It's not what you think. You can only create six schedules, period, and then choose which of those six your device will use. The schedules aren't even open ended: you choose a start time, end time, and on/off frequency and which days it will do that. It's like someone had a specific idea for the schedule and programmed it to do only that. 

The other features are equally ham-fisted: 
1. Yes, it will monitor power usage, both total and at the moment, but it only updates the current number when you click on the device's name. That is, you have to hit back, then forward again to see the new usage, it does not autoupdate. This adds a delay as it reconnects to the device each time. Totally irritating. 
2. The total energy use is only shown as a percent of the total for that month. There is no option to show a graph over each day or week or arbitrary time interval (like the Health app does, for example). Also no option to compare multiple devices over time. In fact, the power usage shouldn't be under a menu, it should be front and center on top of the plug's title card. I need that more than I need to select a color for my plug's name. 
3. You can set up conditions, yes, provided the conditions are either ""turn off when reaching x temperature"" or ""turn off when reaching y power consumption."" There is no support for if-this-then-that or anything remotely useful. The app even demands access to your location data, but there is no way to say ""turn on the switch when I come home."" Too reminiscent of Henry Ford's ""you can get a model T in your favorite color as long as your favorite color is black.""

It really feels like D-link said, ""I hear home automation is going to be a big thing; let's cash in on that,"" made a plug, and then hired a programmer to make a perfunctory app. It does the things I want, sort of, but it's uninspired and could be so much more. These guys need an industrial designer who understands home automation. Or, better yet, just open it up completely and allow people to use it how they want. I might possibly not return it to the store, but I'm certainly not jumping up to buy another one.

Update: the plug/app does not seem to save the power management on/off setting. I turn it on, hit ""apply"" and then go back, click on the device again and it is turned to ""off""";"2015-06-10T01:29:46-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=888259383&type=Purple%20Software";"888259383";499;"en";"POSITIVE"

At first I used the SmartPlug app and I wrote several reviews of how disappointing that app is - it barely matches the capability of the hardware power plugs - set a time and it goes on and off. I am looking for *software* features, such as adjusting on and off times by the length of the day, and randomizing the on and off times to look more natural. The SmartPlug app was a complete failure as far as I was concerned and I told Dlink so.

Then they abandoned that app and said we users of the smart plugs had to switch to mydlink Home (this app) at the end of November. They promised more features, but again this is a completely disappointing experience. 

The user interface is difficult to navigate, etc., etc., but the main failing in my opinion is the complete lack of advanced features. It would be so easy to have the app adjust on and off times by the season (i.e., by the apparent movement of the sun), or add a randomizing adjustment to the times so that behavior seems more natural. Why are times constrained to only the nearest half hour? I should be able to have the light turn on three minutes before the hour so it looks like I’m coming into the room to watch a TV show. I could detail another 10 features that would be (1) easy to do with software and (2) very desirable in the marketplace (they would drive sales). I’ve offered to do this, but nobody from DLink has taken me up on this.

This could be a great product. But at this point, I’m not going to invest in anymore DLink hardware because the software is so limiting.";"2014-12-11T05:14:50-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=888259383&type=Purple%20Software";"888259383";319;"en";"POSITIVE"

I hoped that a company like D-Link could design a reasonably great App for the iPhone. But, apparently not. There seems to be no rhyme nor reason to all the apps that are out here. And this one is just a poor example of UI ease of use, solid bug free code and robust functionality. I will continue to use the app as there is no alternative. Hoping for an upgrade. D-Link just took an integrity hit from my perspective. The quality of this app makes me question the quality of their other products too.

Two smart plugs are not accepting PIN code so I am not able to install them in recommended app - mydlimk home. After long wait for support I was interrogated who I am and if I register ( not working ) plugs. After long discussion we got to trying to fix problem. The recommendation was to download app - smartplug - which connected to the smart plugs but cannot work with motion sensor and do not control devices if I am out of my home wi-fi. So I would like to know where I can get the refund for it - 120$.
