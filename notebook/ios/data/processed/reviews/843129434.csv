As others have said, most if not all negative reviews probably stem from a poor WiFi network. It’s nice that you can hardwire the devices to completely eliminate that from ever being an issue. If there is one thing I could ask for though, it would be an easier access to the EQ and sub level settings while playing music.

I have two HEOS 1 Series 2 speakers with go packs that look and sound amazing when they work.  The problem is the app.  Everytime I use them I have to go into the app and find the devices and reconnect them to Bluetooth.  The app will  come up and say ""searching for devices"" but won't find them, even if I am standing right next to them until I do it multiple times.  Then I have to go back into Bluetooth and connect to the devices all over again.  If you then try linking the two devices to play together which they call ""pairing the devices"" it takes multiple tries as well.  I have to toggle back and forth between Bluetooth trying to connect and the HEOS app trying to pair until they finally work. This takes a minimum of 10 minutes and has to be done everytime you use them.  The app doesn't remember anything you have done before and the devices constantly lose Bluetooth connection.   The app is also very basic with no real features at all.
 I have had these for over a year praying for the day that Denon would try to save their reputation by updating this app with a new awesome version.   NOT!!  Very disappointed in Denon that they don't care enough to put a decent app out there to run an otherwise awesome product.  They look good, sound great and the go pack is phenomenal.

This looks like an app that development engineers hacked up to get the system working. UI organization is horrible with many redundancies and non-intuitive paths to what you want to accomplish. I can live with issue 1, but … Issue 2: some units will not upgrade firmware to latest version. They “think” they’re updated but they’re not. As a result, units have different firmware revisions, which breaks your ability to group speakers to, for example, get them all playing the same music.  After about 48 hours, the culprit speakers do update to latest firmware, but there’s no apparent way to control this other than leaving it up to the auto update feature and waiting until it does its thing in the background. 
Issue 3:  I’m sure it’s a big challenge to make the app interface well with all the music streaming services out there. The app doesn’t allow for search in Pandora, which is a major pain.

There are 3 steps 1) select what you are controlling, where you can easily combine zones to create a multi zone sync. 2) select your source, which can be any streaming service or any input on any of your physical devices and 3) control, volume, pause, skip.

My space is not that big and I already had a Denon receiver so it made sense that I would just buy HEOS speakers to pair them along. Have a HEOS 1, 2, and 7. When the speakers emit sound they are great. Rich and profound sound comes out of them. The problem, and I’ve should have listen to the different blogs on the internet is the App. I feel like I am back at 1989 trying endlessly for any basic computer application to work. It’s insane the amount of time to pair the speakers, the countless times speakers do not appear, the countless times the speakers do not pair. I have probably one of the best internet connections ever but that’s not it. Unfortunately, Denon has applied all of their research and resources into sound quality but have not figure out that is 2019 when it comes to connectivity and wireless applications.

On the heos 1 speakers they sometime just drop off the network and fail to reconnect.   I have to remove the battery base and the power cord then reconnect the power.   Then the speakers come back online.   So the firmware in the speakers probably needs to be reviewed so they reconnect to the WiFi better.  I hope they add a sleep timer to the firmware so the speakers turn off after streaming.   However you can just play an album or a play list.

Denon is now releasing Denon home series and therefore trying to get into smart speaker market. This is a great move from hardware perspective to add another device on their extensive line up. But they seem to be always years after SONOS. 

The biggest issue and trend here is; however, the lack of support on existing customers from software stand point of view. App has looked the same despite all the negativity its receiving on online reviews. Even now still no support on major stream service like Apple Music.

The Heos platform is far and away more advanced and intuitive, is continually updating features and functionality, and is supremely constructed to deliver the very best in sound reproduction possible for a portable streaming solution.

There seems to be a disproportionate amount of negative feedback in the above reviews.  

There are really only two main criteria for complete satisfaction with the Heos line: 1) A comfortable working knowledge of your smart device, and 2) A rock-solid wireless network.  The latter is much more easy and affordable to achieve today.

More of the world needs to experience the product.

Most everything in the 5,000 square foot house is wired.

My wife and I have been so pleased we are going to get additional speakers. I do not know why some of these individuals have been so unhappy, my entire system with the 75 inch Sony TV was extremely expensive. The HEOS are the least expensive items and have given us the greatest joy for what they accomplish and what we paid. It took my wife and myself awhile to understand the app we are 68, but computer sophisticated as it integrated with the rest of the systems. We wish there were simple online instructions. Having the music shut off is not a big issue for us at all. Our system also never fails and is always integrated with the surroundsound amplifier.
