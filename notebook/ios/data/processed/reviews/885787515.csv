I tried to set it up with the Flexi Washer/Dryer combo. The app crashes instantly at the end of account creation. It at least created the account — you will know it, too, as you have to manually enter your password when you start the app. 

Now, I’ve read that you have to also manually enable Smart Control every time you use your washer, which doesn’t sound too “smart.” Unfortunately, I may never be able to try it myself. Despite latest tech and powerful router and signal strength (yes, tried 2.4Ghz and older OS, too), I can’t get the app to connect to the server. I can enable AP search (hold the lower Smart Control Button while the machines are on), find the network, connect the devices... and the it’ll simply never complete the server connection at the very end and times out. 

Given that each machine has two Smart Control buttons, you’d figure Samsung would spend a little more time on getting this stuff to work. Disappointing.";"2018-03-18T14:45:43-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=885787515&type=Purple%20Software";"885787515";190;"en";"POSITIVE"

But I’ll be honest, when I bought them, the WiFi capabilities influenced me exactly 0%. I just couldn’t understand why I would ever need to start my washer remotely. I mean, I still had to sort and load the clothes myself and I still had to add the soap and fabric softener. So what was the point? Then I was leaving the house to go visit a friend for the weekend and wondered if I had remembered to start the dryer. I was already on the road, so I couldn’t check. The answer, of course, was that I hadn’t and my clothes smelled awful when I got home and I had to rewash them all. That’s when I realized the usefulness of the WiFi feature. 

All this to say, the app doesn’t work very well. It only works if the machines are turned on and there’s no way to remotely turn them on and they will turn off automatically after a period of time. Then on top of it, I can’t get the “smart control” to work. It keeps saying something is wrong with my router connection even when I’m standing right next to it.

Push notifications have stopped working a 2-3 weeks ago and when the app is launched the infamous “cannot connect to server” has returned.  It’s amazing that this app is even allowed on the AppStore - it’s by far the worst of 80+ apps on my phone. 
Originally review:
I downloaded this app to connect to my new Samsung Flex washer and dryer. For whatever reason, I needed to log in to my Samsung account to add each “washer/dryer”, so a total of 4 times. Connectivity with the appliances works most of the time, but it’s very slow to discover the devices after opening the app and frequently fails to connect with the server. The functionality I have with the washer and dryer is pause / resume only at this point and I get push notifications when the appliance is done. I’m not sure what purpose the chat with device function has as I can see the status from the device overview page.

I tried the other Samsung Smart Things app, which worked for a while, and then also just failed one day. So, I decided to give this one another try today. Well that was a huge waste of time.

I am a technically adept person. I deal with tech crap all day. I’m good with it. This app asked me to sign in five times in 120 seconds when it was trying to set up the unit on the network.

The vast majority of Samsung devices that this app was meant to support have quietly been added (over time) in the newish SmartThings app.

Why Samsung didn’t advertise this, or put a note in this app’s description that it’s been deprecated and most devices are now supported in SmartThings? I don’t know… but check out that app; it will probably be the solution to your woes today. If your device isn’t supported now, it will likely be in the future — they add new devices on a monthly basis.

Same thing with the dryer except the dryer access point does NOT say, “Samsung Dryer” but it also shows, “[washer] Samsung”

Fix the app or remove the advertising for connectivity. As far as I’m concerned, it’s false advertising to say the machine will connect to WiFi.

You also have to turn on the connection at the appliance every time that you want to use the App. There’s also no way to schedule when you’d like a washer/dryer job to finish.

We last year (May17) had a $30k plus state of the art Ductless Air/Heating system installed in our home. Of course we went for the “SMART HOME” app so we could work the system from our phones to run our home while we were away or to check on each individual unit in each room of our home since every room has its own unit and control. I was able to enable the app and got it working well and was happy with it for about six months until Samsung did their last app update in early 2018. After their update what ever they did it completely rendered the app useless!!!!!  I have downloaded and deleted this app for the last six months too many times to count. Finally (May 2018) I downloaded the app and it took me thru all the steps and told me the download was complete I was excited to finally get this back up and running. That excitement was so short lived (about 5 minutes) that I said a few choice words because the app kept kicking me back to sign in and would search search and search and them come back and show me I wasn’t connected to the system. Log in again and again and again and that’s as far as it has gotten. This being a “SMART” app had to have had a moron writing it and tried to pass it off as his brain child hoping they would think he/she was so smart!!  Apple why do you put this crappy app out there for  Samsung?  They defiantly don't belong there.

The app is still very slow. It takes a good few minutes through several loading screens before I can control my vacuum. 

The app is still very buggy. Every time I open it after it’s been a more than 30 seconds the app will start by giving me an error that it lost connection to my vacuum. It also will randomly fail to actually send a command or an updated setting to the vacuum. The pairing process to my account has to be repeated for every device you want to use this app in, which means in order for my wife and I to both have control of the vacuum from our phones I had to restart the WiFi connection process each time. Then the app forgot both our phones so we had to do it again about two months later. 

It constantly fails to send me notifications. So for example if the vacuum gets stuck or lost it is supposed to tell me so I can go find it and save it. However it often fails to do that so I don’t know it failed till I come home and see the vacuum isn’t back at its charger. 

It has a remote function where I can manually tell the vacuum what to do but the lag between cell Phone to vacuum is so bad that it is utterly useless. 

This app and product (my robot vacuum) is the only time that I can think of where using the IR remote to control it is the far preferred experience to using the app. There is nothing useful you can do with this app that you cannot do with the remote with the only exception being turning on the vacuum from another room or outside of the house. All the other functions just don’t work or Work so poorly that you won’t use them. 

Luckily the vacuum itself is actually pretty great. Just put it on a daily schedule and empty the bin every day and forget about it. It doesn’t get stuck very often once it learns your house. The app just is useless.";"2017-10-01T11:32:01-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=885787515&type=Purple%20Software";"885787515";382;"en";"NEGATIVE"

409;2974094854;"Psychogiggle";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id18507440";"3.1194.938";1;"This is not smart!!";"I love Samsung products. I have purchased their TV’s, refrigerators, microwaves, washers, dryers, etc for YEARS and have had great success with the products and with Samsung customer service. But this app is so bad I cannot believe they even put their name on it!!!  If this is the only way to make Samsung “Smart” products smart - then this is FALSE ADVERTISING!!! 

I purchased the Samsung Smart washer and was very excited to have my “Smart” washer actually tell me when it was done with the wash cycle!  I have a bad habit of forgetting the clothes are in there. But the Smart home feature was hugely disappointing!!! It took me MONTHS to get the washer and the app to connect with each other. Partly because the instructions that came with the washer directed me to a different app that apparently is no longer maintained.  Once I got the correct app and was able to follow the horrible instructions correctly I finally got them to connect. 

Then imagine my disappointment when I realized that I have to turn on “Smart Control” every time I put a load in the wash. Once you select “Smart Control”, the washer locks and you can’t do anything from the washer - it must all be done from the app!  That’s fine except for when you missed a shirt and you need to add it to the wash. The app says there is an add clothes feature, but trust me, you cannot add anything!! It does not work! The washer is locked. 

Then the app does not actually tell me when the wash is done as I have to reconnect with the washer every time I open the app.  Perhaps it would tell me if I left the app open on my phone for the hour and 15 minutes that the cycle is going - but really??  Who is going to do that? When the washer is done and I am able to connect back to the app it actually just says “disconnected”.  No notification or message sent. There is a badge on the app, but that shows up a very long time after the wash is done.  So what is the point? I can’t tell it I want to rinse the clothes again or anything! I really thought once I got the washer to connect with the app all would be great. But the app is just completely lame. Why does it have to reconnect every single time I open it? Why does it tell me that my washer must be unplugged or my WiFi must be down? It connects again within 2 minutes but really? Every time? I don’t think this is very smart. I thought maybe it would work better once I connected it to Alexa, but I have yet to get Alexa to be able to discover my washer!! (Even though they are supposed to be compatible). She has every Samsung skill there is, and they are both connected to the same WiFi, but as hard as I try, I cannot get them to connect. 

So if you want a smart home - I recommend that you don’t use Samsung Smarthome. They make great appliances but not smart ones.";"2018-07-26T14:51:47-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=885787515&type=Purple%20Software";"885787515";539;"en";"POSITIVE"

I use SmartThings for Home Automation, even though some aspects and features are frustrating. I just purchased a 65” Q9, which is probably the greatest TV ever created. 

While Samsung, in my opinion, makes great products, they’re attempts and making them useful in home automation leaves a LOT to be desired. Especially coming from an innovative technology company. 

I just got a $1,200 Samsung smart dishwasher. The dishwasher itself is fantastic. The smart features will leave you disappointed.  

First off, it’s not available in SmartThings, so I was forced to use the Samsung Smart Home App, which was probably designed by Middle School interns to keep the cost down. It’s pretty obvious that Samsung invests very little development dollars into the app when several of the areas you go into have the crappy looking text of iPhone apps from 5 years ago. Add to that the utter annoyance that you have to keep logging into the app and putting in the security letter/Number combo that auto-generates, and you have a frustrating experience in the making. 

After I finally got the dishwasher connected via WiFi to the app, I then had to go to an online forum to understand why Smart Control wouldn’t stay on. (FYI, you have to hit the button and then close the door). 

So, here is a synopsis of the Samsung Smart Home Appliance experience:

1. Crappy App
2. Not compatible with SmartThings, which is supposed to be their SmartHome platform of the future. 
3. In order to control an appliance, you actually have to turn the appliance on and hit the smart connect button, which begs the question, if I have to walk up to it anyway, then why would I use the app?
4. If you turn your dishwasher off, it disconnects. 

In summary, LOVE Samsung appliances. They should probably try to hire some people from Apple to completely revamp their Smart Home division and actually make it technically match the companies other qualities.";"2018-08-25T12:17:10-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=885787515&type=Purple%20Software";"885787515";336;"en";"POSITIVE"

I'm sorry to say that although the app shows promise for future development, it is a clunky experience that is not representative of what I believe the Samsung brand represents with its innovative line of products.  It is slow, unresponsive, and unexpectedly quits frequently. I am using the latest and greatest iPhone, and then completely up-to-date so the fault does not live with my hardware or software.
