- instructions aren't that clear
- I don't like the fact that you can't save the pixelation from the iPhone 
- the actual app seems like it's from the 1990s, not 2015. I know we didn't have apps in the 90s but that is how I feel about the user friendliness and the layout.

Also, a greatly needed improvement to this app would be having the ability to easily turn on and off motion alert emails. You have to go through your desk top (no ability on app) and go through 5 to 10 different steps to get into each camera to turn off the motion anytime you want to turn your system on and off. There is no easy way to turn motion alert on and off on the system.
It is my biggest complaint about this entire set up. You should be able to just go through your app and quickly turn the cameras on and off promotion alert. I hope they update this.
