It is designed to monitor the AC current with some high and low threshold that isn’t settable. If the current exceed 800mA it assumes you have some sort of short. If it is at 0 it assumes you have an open. If it is anywhere between that it assumes all is well.  It all seems to be based on a single zone/ relay install. This is great in that situation as if there is a problem you are informed. However, many irrigation systems have an irrigation pump which is controlled via the MV relay. While you have to program this MV relay and the report says there are two solenoids, the solenoid current monitoring alarm is totally oblivious to the fact there are two relays. So if a zone opens from a fault there is still current going to the MV relay and still turns the pump on. The controller thinks all is fine as the current isn’t 0. Now the pump is pumping water but there is nowhere to send the water. After about a month of this I noticed my grass dying. Went to investigate and my pump melted and so did the PVC pipe. $1000 in repairs.  If only it knew what the MV current rating was or if it monitored the actual current versus the average over the last 10 runs it would easily shut of and given me an alarm.  So all this intelligence and it failed to do one of the basic of intelligence.";"2021-03-10T20:46:00-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=490594689&type=Purple%20Software";"490594689";258;"en";"POSITIVE"

I use the reports section quite a bit and it defaults to the last week. So the first thing I have to do is change it to today and it does not retain the end user changes from session to session. Also the total water usage totals don’t always jive with the flow meter totals. Would be really nice if the app let you download the data into your own spreadsheet for further analysis.  

Don’t pay for the 5 weather stations service. For me it’s proven highly inaccurate.  The only modification trigger that has helped me is the % chance of rain to abort watering.  There is much room for improvement here to have it interface with your own weather observations at your exact location.  

All in all I like the app and hope they continue to enhance it. User defaults would be a huge plus.";"2020-05-11T08:20:21-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=490594689&type=Purple%20Software";"490594689";171;"en";"POSITIVE"

Every time I interact with the app there is always some different performance issue.  Other things: I constantly have to log in with my email address (no “remember me” option). This is a real pain if my hands are wet or I’m wearing gloves. I agree with the other reviewer about the default report to week and need to always switch to day. The overall intersections of options are really not intuitive- setting a time on a zone is required, then you put it on a program schedule that overrides that, so the zone schedule time is no longer used or relevant. It’s not clear what zone settings vs program schedules are driving at any point in time. Overall insight into my set up is lacking. My water usage grew dramatically last month (based on my water bill) - I didn’t have insight into that. Perhaps I’ll add a flow meter, but out of the box I’m not seeing something like “total minutes programmed per day” or something that would give me a sense of what I’ve programmed over time and to make sure I did not cross my wires among all the levels of set up.

Separately, I am surprised it doesn’t have a way to cancel or postpone upcoming waterings when you’re looking at the schedule.

The stations are not near my home, so their weather doesn’t match my house. Result: the sprinklers often are running while it’s raining, or after it has rained. I can download any number of weather apps which know the weather at any location in the US. But this app doesn’t know. 

The app itself is bad. It’s clearly a web app ported to mobile. As a result, its touch responsiveness is bad and it feels slow. Page transitions are terrible. 

It’s missing major features. Once a program starts, I cannot stop the whole program. I often need to do that because it’s running while it’s raining. The only thing you can do is stop an individual zone once it has started. So, I need to check back with the app every 20mins and stop each zone as it starts. Ridiculous. 

A smart sprinkler system is about good software.

However, it could use one major improvement to make it more customizable and user friendly.  With its current settings, to run multiple programs at different times/days during the week, and for different durations, you have to stack programs ... or use the remote function to adjust the duration and zones to water, but the remote function has to be set manually each time and can’t be set as a recurring program. The Preconfigured Program in the app defaults to your original watering duration time, in this case we’ll use 30 min, which it won’t let you adjust.  To run a second program with a different duration you have to “stack” programs. An example of stacking would be if your normal watering time is 30 minutes at 7am, but you also wanted to syringe (spray or cool down) your lawn for 5 minutes at 4pm during the summer months ... the preconfigured watering program is almost useless in my opinion. To set up this program so you could syringe for 5 minutes, you would have to stack your main programs in 5 minute increments i.e. 7:00-7:05, 7:05-7:10, 7:10-7:15, 7:15-7:20, 7:20-7:25, 7:25-7:30, then you could set a schedule for syringing for 5 minutes at 4pm ... because now your main watering time is 5 minutes.

The app is fairly intelligent as it integrates with external sources to provide predictive watering which is really nice - helps minimize water usage.  In terms of “usability”, The scheduling functionality is relatively simple although I am a really infrequent user and when I have had to go back in and tweak the schedule, it takes me time fumble around with the controls on the screen (drop down lists, etc).  Some appear disabled (greyed out) even though they are enabled, etc. If the scheduling was a bit more graphical, that would be beneficial.  In any case, it’s still fairly usable for an infrequent user.  

The one big thing I don’t like about this application is the manual login.  I should be able to authenticate using my fingerprint.  But, I don’t see that as an option and, is also the reason why I have been mostly “off” than on.  I forgot my password finally only after a few months got time to change my password and log back in.

With that said, there are several issues we continually deal with. iPhone 7+ and other devices will not load the app with notifications turned off. Tech support could not help and it is a continual issue. Notifications are off due to the issues with the proprietary flow sensor that gives false readings and we have had failures ever since we started installing them. We constantly get false alerts to leaks and waste time on service calls that are not there. But on the flip side, if there is a true leak, when don’t know what’s accurate and what’s not.

Over all there is good promise with this app. The UI and UX needs a major overhaul. Notifications need to be fixed. And The Flow sensor errors need to be addressed as well. That could just be a hardware related issue.

Thus far I am very pleased with purchase.  The only downside is that it doesn't offer auto adjustments for rainfall unless you pay $60 a year.  For those of us that only water a max of 6 months a year it seems unlikely you can recoup that cost in water savings.

First, some of the settings are difficult to understand, for the consumer.

Second, the ""Observations"" panel on the Dashboard seems to be broken: it's blank where it should show current temperature and rainfall.

Third, the system needs better information about rainfall, closer to real time.  I paid extra for this to avoid those embarrassing moments when the sprinklers are on in the middle of a rain storm.

Edit: changing my rating from 1 to 3 stars because I figured out how to set up different run times. Basically you need to set the zone to 10 minutes (for example) then give it 3 start times if you want it to run for 30 min.

I’ve set up weather stations in our area and a virtual weather station at our home and our irrigation runs based on the weather reports averaged between the stations. We do pay a yearly fee to allow us to use more weather stations but it’s worth it to us. 
The setup for basic watering using multiple zones is fairly painless.
However setting up the parameters for current weather information from weather stations to control irrigation is a bit more complicated. 
The complication arises from the fact that you cannot see both the page you’re working on and the instructions at the same time. 
Using screen shots of the instructions on my iPhone and the setup page on my iPad made the process somewhat simpler.
The one complaint I have is user support: 
Typing into the help screen is a joke, I find it almost impossible to correct typos as there seems to be no back function, no way to use the curser for correction and sometimes it freezes up completely and I have to close then reopen the app and begin again. 
That’s all very frustrating but that’s not the worst!
On 09/05/19 I was finally able to send a coherent message about using the run time calculator, which requires setting up a separate account. 
I had numerous times attempted to set up that account but the program would recognize neither the username nor the password I’d set up when I tried to log in. 
After numerous attempts I send an email  about this problem giving the information about the app not recognizing the username or password. 
I was told I needed to set up a separate account...... really? 
I replied that I was aware of that and explained again what the issue was and in next email I received I was asked had I tried to use the “forgot Password” option.
I affirmed I had but since the program did not recognize my username that was useless. 
On 09/06/19 I received a reply stating that the gentleman I was corresponding with would contact a rep who could assist me with this issue....... to date I have had no reply. 
I did receive another email on 09/07 asking what I thought of the customer service I received...... I only wish there had been an option other than “Good, I’m satisfied” and “Bad, I’m unsatisfied”...... I checked “Bad” but again have had no reply.
It appears to me that customer service here is rather nonexistent.
UPDATE 05/15/2020
Clearly no one at Hunter cares about customer issues or reads these reviews. 
I have yet to receive a reply from anyone at Hunter for my September 2019 issue. 
If I hadn’t already bought the Hunter WiFi controller and gone to the trouble of setting up this app I would probably look for something else to use.

Very simple to set up as it walks you through step by step. 

I did install a flow sensor that works incredible! This Hydrawise controller has so many features compared to others. I am able to program from the controller, has predictive watering, monitors electrical current and also monitors flow to alert you if there is an electrical issue or broken water lines. The other controllers I have tried are not capable of these items. It also works with Amazon Alexa!

 Rain bird WiFi controller is only app based not web based so, zero control on others devices such as tablet or PC. The weather pulls from a zip code so it’s not very accurate with the weather and adjusting the schedule. Because it’s app based, if you loose your phone you have to reprogram all zones with your phone. 

Rachio controller is okay but must be programmed with the phone. No walking up to the controller to start a zone.
