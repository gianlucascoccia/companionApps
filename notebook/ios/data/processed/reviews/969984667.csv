The new one has been working for over two years.  Initially the software interface wasn’t properly syncing when my wife and I were setting alarm from 2 phones.  They seem to have fixed that with a system wide software update.  They’re based in France.

My parents and aunt both had the same thing happen to them. Trying to get help is like pulling teeth. I guess once they bought MyFox they decided to drop support for all of their products.
