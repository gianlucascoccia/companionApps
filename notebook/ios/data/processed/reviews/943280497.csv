The wide view pro mirror is quite expensive but is very well made, compare it to high priced sports car. 
One thing that irritates me is the side mirrors that don’t help in any way to view the side of your face or head. I would look only in the middle main mirror so not sure the purpose of the sides being there. Maybe the next go around they’ll make the sides more flexible!
However, I put my mirror on a tall cabinet in my bathroom with the magnifier. I’m 5’10” so I stand looking at the mirror.

It doesn't allow odor to escape and has nothing external the girls can get a nose under to lift.

So when you sign up you select your frequency and quantity. Pretty simple. But the actual app layout is somewhat confusing and difficult to use. Although my first couple deliveries were fine and the product was delivered as requested. But when COVID hit I needed to stop my deliveries. That’s when it got tough. 

The app is so extremely deceptive it’s next to impossible to find ‘where’ to cancel your subscription. After emailing them to request help and receiving an automated response saying give us 3 days to get back to you, I finally figured it out on my own. 

If you need to cancel at anytime, you can. Just click the product- getting to it is harder than you’d think. 

I’m just your average guy and can usually figure these things out but this one was a doozy. Definitely won’t be using it anymore.";"2020-06-10T07:07:52-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=943280497&type=Purple%20Software";"943280497";196;"en";"POSITIVE"

First is a hole in the interior liner holder that lets the air out as you place the liner into the can. 

Next is a hydraulic action when the lid closes so it does not come down with a bang.

I hope this lasts longer than the 18 months the last two kitchen cans I have owned. The size is just right for our small kitchen that I hesitate to buy anything smaller or larger since this is the perfect size to fit our needs.

The hole in the back of the liner in the interior liner holder will help keep the plastic liner from bunching up at the top and therefore making the lid of the can catch creating more pressure on mechanism that opens a lid causing it to fail inside of two years.

I will be happy to buy a lifetime of liners if only the mechanism that opens the lid will hold out that long.";"2019-07-26T17:02:09-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=943280497&type=Purple%20Software";"943280497";176;"en";"POSITIVE"
