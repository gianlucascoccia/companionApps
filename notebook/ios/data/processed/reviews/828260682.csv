Even though it lists both my wife and I as inside, it states that our location services are off and never triggers Auto-Away. I’ve uninstalled, turned location services off and back on in the app and on both phones to no avail. 

I was enjoying the system and app until this latest update. Please fix this asap as it’s been over a week and this is a big feature that a lot of people use. It’s hard to believe that it made it through Beta testing without being noticed. I’ll change my review once this has been fixed.

Set-up of devices has been easy, including Abode window/door sensors, Zigbee water leak sensors, and a Z-Wave water main shut-off valve, triggered by leak sensors we placed below pipes in the crawl space under the house. Through firmware updates that are advertised via the Abode app, they’ve added HomeKit and have simplified features, making things ever more simple the longer we’ve had the system. Alerts for home monitoring took some time to set up but all was relatively straightforward once I figured it out. I’d suggest that the Abode team recommend some standard alerts (I.e. send me a notification if someone leaves a door open for more than 20 minutes, etc.) to introduce how the app can be used to simplify life at (or away from) home. It’s amazing how the system just works with any home automation part we can find. 10/10!";"2021-09-18T17:12:02-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=828260682&type=Purple%20Software";"828260682";168;"en";"POSITIVE"

The over all product experience is surpassingly rough for a 4+ year old company. 

For example adding a bunch of sensors at once, every 5th one seems to make the app hang and leave the sensor in limbo. Force quite, re-open, remove sensor, force quite so it’s internal cache doesn’t get confused, re-add. That’s dumb. 

The industrial design is basic. Just barely passable compared to pretty much everyone but old school SimpliSafe or hardwired ADT. If you can do the embedded or slim sensors, I’d go that route. The sounds it makes are also unpleasant and the integrations to make custom sounds are so slow you might as well not have them. People have been asking for good sound for literally years and nothing changes…

Performance is also meh. Supposedly can cover large houses but I have some sensors that trigger open but never trigger back to closed. Move closer and it works just fine. Rapidly open and closing a door often SKIPS an alert. It’s conceivable that such a lag is a security concern. HomeKit support is top notch, it’s as fast and as accurate as the underlying Abode bridge. 

At the end of the day I wish I would have stuck with SimpliSafe. It’s more expensive and has no official HomeKit support, but at least it’s a rock solid and nicely designed system.";"2021-11-18T08:18:59-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=828260682&type=Purple%20Software";"828260682";248;"en";"POSITIVE"

Errors are thrown with no clarity as to why when trying to create certain automations but not others. Some of the Abode hardware works with IFTTT, but not all. Their own motion sensors for example do not integrate. Abode’s website simply says they “proudly support IFTTT”...this is misleading.

PROS: 
• Great Security System with many features and controls. BUT ....

CONS:
• MANY FUNCTIONS ARE NOT AVAILABLE from within the app. You HAVE to go to your account on the Browser.  And the problem with that is many of those functions on the web based version are NOT smart phone friendly. You’d best have access to a desktop PC. 

• THE AUTOMATIONS FUNCTION is only available as a beta version.  It frequently acts buggy for me -probably because they are making changes.
Guess I’m old-fashioned - the companies I worked for we all tested our stuff BEFORE we released it.

• Abode NEEDS TO REDESIGN THE COLORS OF THE APP. Light cyan against a white background is difficult for some of us to read.  The present color scheme might look cool but not every user has 20 year old eyes. 

• Abode NEEDS TO REDESIGN THE APP UI TO MAKE IT SIMPLER - Especially if they are not going to make all the presently web-based functions available in the app.

Sometime the app update logs me out or loses some devices … just wait a day or two they have come back so far. Service is really hit and miss, have had support staff that seem to know less about the tech than the average customer and motion sensors are a joke. The IP cameras are ok, live feed defiantly needs a good internet connection and cell backup has lots live feed. Motion cameras were all defective, even the 3rd replacements didn’t work. Overall though SimpliSafe was not much better and costs so much more, I am stuck with abode until a more reliable service and still affordable like abode comes along. Even this latest update was a full app crash, can’t even launch the app on an iPhone 12 with up to date iOS. Response time is not very fast, water leak sensors worked but if you don’t set up your own text or email alert then you will not get notified as abode will not call you about a leak. All in all it works, not super great but worth the money thus far in my years worth of use. Expect to do your own trouble shooting and have to tell tech support what they need to do, stay away from the motion cameras and the multi sensors are ok for temperature and light readings but don’t rely on them for motion alert coverage. Even on lowest setting and lots of distance between sensor and nearest object resulted in alarm trigger and cops all around the house at 4 am when not a sole was home.";"2021-08-06T22:14:59-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=828260682&type=Purple%20Software";"828260682";281;"en";"NEGATIVE"

It took a week just to get a phone call to buy the system, there’s zero help or support when something goes wrong, there is no help or contact us button in the app, and it has de-integrated twice in the past month and every time it does, I have to set up each and every window and door sensor in each and every room, organize them to the rooms I want them in in HomeKit, and redo all the automations. Which means the more products and equipment you get from them, the harder it is and longer it takes to set it up again. And after months of having the system with several instances of having to set it up several times in HomeKit, my keypad battery is low-totally fine and to be expected. However, I plug it in to charge it and have no way of knowing what the actual battery level is. Is it even charging? The symbol is green so I suppose it is, but the base station continues to beep at me every 30 seconds and there is no percentage indicator anywhere in the app as to the battery level. Is it at 1% or 50%? Will I know when it’s done charging? If anyone else integrates with HomeKit, I’d likely leave Abode, even if it meant losing all the money I paid for equipment. Honestly, here’s hoping they get their act together and focus on UI and UX because when you’re claim to fame is integrating with Apple, I think we expect more.";"2021-11-21T07:38:16-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=828260682&type=Purple%20Software";"828260682";284;"en";"POSITIVE"

 I installed the Iota gateway and Outdoor Smart Cam; setup was pretty smooth, but the IOS app won't hold onto certain settings (like camera sensitivity), and some functions do not work correctly; (when I turned-off notifications to mobile devices on image capture, it ignored the setting and continued sending alerts) Some system settings exist in the IOS app that don't in the web app, another indication they are getting ahead of themselves.

Documentation is basic, which for many functions and devices is fine, but the myriad settings within Abode are not well explained. Some have a useful note, many don't, and the interactions between certain settings are unclear. In my perfect world, each setting should have a little (i) alongside that when clicked would describe the setting and its interactions thoroughly.

Alexa integration went fine initially, but a simple Alexa routine to trigger an audio alert on camera motion and start the video feed on an Echo Show would fail about every third time. While this could certainly be on Amazon's side, it's still not a good experience for a security solution.  That said, getting video within the Abode app worked consistently for me. 

I've had several interactions with three of their support team, both via email and phone, most quite positive. 

I so wanted this to work, but for a security system I need to rely upon, Abode is not yet prime-time.  Too much beta testing with production customers, which might be fine for a music app, but for home security, unacceptable to me.";"2021-05-12T10:37:14-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=828260682&type=Purple%20Software";"828260682";280;"en";"POSITIVE"

The app is responsive and changing the system status is a breeze. I often use it instead of the key fob since my phone is always on me. Getting notifications of the status change is great since it lets me and my wife know that we didn’t forget to arm the system.

I’ll echo two suggestions that have been mentioned: 1) battery life needs to be improved and 2) more settings should be available within the iOS app rather than the web app. The battery drain is the biggest issue for me. According to iOS, Abode is one of the biggest battery drains for me yet it’s active on the screen for only a few minutes in the past week. Most of the battery drain is in the background. I’ve disabled the feature to arm/disarm the system based on my location yet it’s still draining my battery.";"2017-09-21T22:22:21-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=828260682&type=Purple%20Software";"828260682";170;"en";"POSITIVE"

In general I really enjoy using the mobile app. I really only have 2 areas that I think could be improved. 1) Geofencing - while the core functionality of the geofencing is fantastic, it really drains the battery life on my iPhone 6s. I'm hoping there is a way of optimizing the way the Abode app is using GPS for geofencing in a way that will prolong battery life. 2) Certain settings cannot be changed from the mobile app. There are two potential ways to address this - either update the mobile app to support more setting changes or make the website more mobile compatible. Currently when accessing the website from a phone, the site is almost unusable. You have to go to landscape mode just to see certain things...  even then, some things are impossible to do through your phone.

8. Custom ""modes""- be able to fine tune multiple modes and name them.  Not super important.  Rational. We have a hot tub on back porch, I would like to create a separate ""home"" arm command to have all the same settings and ignore the back door.

The unit also switches appropriately between WiFi and cellular in the event of service disruption. The camera I bought is HD, yet the quality is relatively low and you can’t maximize the view in the app. As far as I know the only way to capture video is during 30 second frames offloaded to a mini SD. For whatever reason when I press record, nothing happens. This worked previously but I may need to reset the base station?  The “online” storage doesn’t continuously record and only keeps a record of events. Handy but not entirely clear in the advertising.

Panic buttons and not being able to see well in the dark sounds like personal issues. An issue that should have been resolved with research before purchasing a security system.

I find that the IR technology works fairly well in the dark. If someone comes through my doors, I will definitely be able to see their face.

My favorite feature about this system is the live streaming camera. From my phone, I’m able to speak through my Echo dot and look through my Abode Live Stream camera allowing me to talk to my dog who has anxiety. One feature that I wish Abode could improve is saving more that 7-8 seconds of video.

Abode’s customer service is “on point.” I had an issue where the live video stop recording sound. I called Abode and they resolved the problem within minutes. They were kind and answered all of my questions.

Sure, there are other security services. Possibly some with better cameras or with panic buttons. Nonetheless, for the price of his system, I am more than pleased.

3.) The stickie things will destroy your wall when you take them off.

4.) you can’t turn off SOME of the email alerts.  I don’t understand why they prevent you from doing this.  Every time you set the alarm you get an alert and an email.  It was really annoying.

300;1730991773;"Coinc";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id40197743";"3.93";4;"System works as expected, app is under developed";"The Abode system itself has been working just as expected. I haven't had any issues with the sensors, and the ability to have a cellular backup in the case of a power outage far outweighs the struggles of the growing brand. 

The app and the user interface of the system is complex and confusing so it takes awhile to learn. 
1- The arm and disarm functions in the app is a very tiny icon in the upper corner. Easy to overlook and hard to access. 
2- There is no way to set off the alarm in the case of an emergency. For example, if someone breaks through your window while you are home and you don't have the glass break sensors on that window, you'd have to arm your system and then go set off one of your sensors to make the alarm go off. They do have a way to set a button on your keyfob to a panic button, but you run into the same issue. If you are unable to reach your keyfob, or if you aren't even home but can see someone lurking around outside the house through a camera, you're out of luck. The only work around is creating a ""action"" where you can click the button on your app and it can be set to send a specific message to an emergency contact, or you personally can call the police. But most people have a DIY alarm system to scare off intruders, so the alarm itself does the grunt work. 
3- As other users have mentioned, the app itself has a lot of buttons that give you a pop up to ""go to the browser"" and no actual app functionality. Then the browser on a smaller screen is just as useless. They have buttons on the far edge of lines that you can't see from a phone, so you are forced to use a tablet or computer.
4- It would be a huge benefit to have a larger selection of arm modes similar to how ismartalarm has set it up. I usually prefer to have an Away (everything armed with delayed entry), Home (back door unarmed to let dogs in and out), Sleep (immediately alarms), Maintenance (notification if someone enters but no alarm), and a Standby. Right now Abode only gives you 3 options which can be customized to your preference ""standby"", ""home"", ""away"". 
5- This may be more my fault than Abode, but I still haven't figured out how to make Abode call me if the alarm is triggered. I know you can do it through the IFTTT, but testing it hasn't been successful yet. **update** you can set it up the IFTTT and it works just as expected!
6- If you exit the app screen it automatically locks you out. I have my phone fingerprint protected so the only one able to access the app is me. It would be helpful to choose how long you'd stay logged in. **update** to fix this you can disable Touch ID in the settings. Then you will no longer have to login each time you re-enter the app. 
7- Automations are wonderful. I haven't experienced any downfall or issues with them, other than you can't edit them in the app (see line item 3). **update** the location services drained my batter (like abode alone used of 44%) so some automations are a battery killer. 
8- No way to give feedback to the developers of the app. **update** you can email support center and they can forward to the developers. 

Overall I would still recommend Abode. It is a great system that I think will only get better. Hopefully some of the functionalities, like the panic button in the app, that are standard in other systems will will be added in soon. **update** I'm still very happy with my purchase!";"2017-08-16T20:10:32-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=828260682&type=Purple%20Software";"828260682";644;"en";"NEGATIVE"

I launched up the Abode app since the thank you email said so. I set up my gateway and the sensors. I got this system since its the only one that’s HomeKit compatible (without hassle, that is). Well, after a glitchy update from the hardware, I went to adjust the motion sensors and door sensors for the Away and Home scenes. I could not get them to stay at the setting I wanted! After 20 minutes I gave up. I noticed that the app said I had to upgrade to the pro plan to use some features. I knew I purchased it with the bundle online. Every time I kept pressing the plan button in the app, it sent me to safari. Customer service takes a millennia to reach you. They could not figure out why my pro plan wasn’t activated to my account. 6 hours later, I went to their sign-in web page online. They made me redo all the naming for my sensors. I thought I was going to crash it since I had already done it. With much distress, I just continued to see what would happen. After renaming all my sensors, the giant activate pro plan page came up! Woo!!! I deleted my sensors in the Home app, reset the Abode app, then re-linked my sensors to Home app. BAM! Everything works fine now. All the scenes do what they are suppose to, and my sensors are fully functioning. I went back to the web app and adjusted my sensors and now the settings stay. I do not touch anything on the app only to disarm and arm if my internet is down. 
Overall, this app needs a lot of adjustments and bug squishing for new customers like me. I did get very stressed but I got everything working. I was very close to returning everything back if I could not get it working. Pro Plans and other subscriptions NEED to be accessible from the app. I gave this app two stars for all the headaches it caused me.";"2020-05-28T00:05:54-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=828260682&type=Purple%20Software";"828260682";357;"en";"POSITIVE"

The key fob never works past two weeks. I had it replaced twice and both stopped working, even when I swapped new batteries. I gave up.

The program would flicker and lag after turning the alarm on. And even no sounds will come from it.

The video quality is HORRIBLE. I bought this for the camera and I feel like I am watching a video on YT from 2008. 480p, blurry, laggy, audio bugs and skips.

It takes FOREVER to load up the stream. If it even does load up. And once you got it going, sometimes, it stops the stream a few second or two minutes in.

Although cameras are indoor/outdoor they must be plugged in to work. There’s no batteries which would’ve been helpful for outdoor setup. All other sensor devices setup easily including 3rd party CO smoke detectors was a breeze.  However, the count down to enter device code is too short. I missed entering code in time allotted and can’t seem to go back to reset and enter again. So the device is showing up red. Will do the usual uninstall/reinstall app to see if that clears the device for entering as new. What really would be nice is an integration that spoke the location of the device notification instead of just a beep so you don’t always have to look at the app to see which device is triggered. Also arming with faults should notify what device has a fault and why so the issue can be remedied.

On the downside, Abode suffered a cloud outage today Feb 16 2020 and during this outage that last for about an hour, I couldn’t pair devices or really do much of anything. So it appears this thing is very much dependent on the cloud being online. The app is pretty buggy even when their cloud is working. It needs quite a bit of work. When you reboot the gateway, it takes a while for it to see the statuses of the various sensors.
