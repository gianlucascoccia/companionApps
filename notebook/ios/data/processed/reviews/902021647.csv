Basically the house is two stories high, with upstairs bedrooms, and large open areas over the first floor kitchen, and family and living rooms.  The rest of downstairs is normal ceilings.  4,000 sq ft house.

There are two HVAC units; downstairs has 4 area thermostats and upstairs has two area thermostats.  In the summer (in Virginia), generally only the upstairs HVAC runs, and in the winter generally only the downstairs HVAC runs.

The three fans keep the temperature differential between upstairs and downstairs to 0-1 degree.  They run, and adjust, automatically based on their internal sensors to maintain temperature.

The fans are silent.  If you manually crank them up, you only hear wind noise.  In the winter you can barely feel the air movement from them running; yet they are able to maintain minimal differential.

They have lights that can be set to turn on and off automatically, when you enter and exit.  The lights will self adjust based on available light to maintain the rooms overall illumination.

The fans are beautiful.  We have had them for a little over a year and have had no issues.  They will collect dust (we live on a horse farm with three dogs in and out of the house), so we have a telescopic duster for them.

The app works great, but you will need to learn how to make the app control the fans the way you want them to run.";"2020-11-22T14:09:01-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=902021647&type=Purple%20Software";"902021647";254;"en";"POSITIVE"

I prefer more modern designs So I was drawn to its simplicity.  It’s a beautiful fan.  It works as well as it looks.  That’s an unusual combo.  It’s high end at a reasonable price.  I went to buy a second fan for my bedroom as I was renovating that room and the price had doubled in like two or three years since I’d purchased the first one.  So I tapped the brakes and started looking at other brands even though I felt I’d probably be unhappy with the other ones.  There was just no way I was paying $700 for this item.  I got an email from Haiku that they were having an Independence Day sale of 50% off.  I ordered it the same day.

The app and the smart home integration work pretty well but a few things are quite baffling. 

Most fan behaviors can be scheduled and separate start and stop events can be configured to avoid overlap. 

We use the sleep feature on the fan every evening since it is in a bedroom and we have temp swings of 30+ degrees at night. We use the schedule to start this feature but there is apparently no way to automate stopping sleep mode or have it limited to a certain amount of time. 

This means you have to stop sleep mode with the app or remote in the morning and if you forget to turn it off it will just keep going and blow out your other schedules which is really annoying. 

You also can’t control the fan over the Internet (local WiFi control only) so no way to do it remotely after you leave home. 

Might seem like a small thing but it’s not. Sleep mode should have a configurable time for timing out or even just a default of 10 or 12 hours. When the fan is in sleep mode no other scheduled actions can happen.";"2020-08-27T09:47:55-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=902021647&type=Purple%20Software";"902021647";215;"en";"NEGATIVE"

The app immediately defaults to setting up device after logging in with no way out or around.  Every other smart home device we own saves all setting information within the account, hence not starting over when adding the app to new device.

It made no difference if restarting the app or restarting the iPhone.

The connection with the fan came back after a day or two, but today (5 days after first issue) it disconnected again.

It makes no apparent difference from updating to the new iOS version 11.1.2, vs running on the previous version.

The first was a 52"", with the light, for my staircase but before I spent the money for the second larger 84"" fan for my living room I wanted to make sure that it would work as claimed with my new wi-fi controlled Nest thermostat I recently installed. The first fan was a breeze to install and set up with Nest. Amazingly it works perfectly with Nest and was the deciding factor I needed to convince myself to order the second larger 84"" for my living room. I have high vaulted ceilings and I was concerned about the down rod length and the slope. Not to worry as the lengths provided was perfect for my 16' ceilings. Both fans are controlled by Nest even though they are both in different rooms. The larger fan in the living room helps force the hot air trapped at the high vaulted ceiling down to my air return for the air conditioner and now my system only takes about fifteen minutes to cool the house down from 85 degrees to 72. Before it would take over two hours. The plus for for me is when I'm on my way home from working odd hours I can start the fans with with the Nest app because there wirelessly connected and have my house at a comfy 72 degrees by time I get home. Even though the fan assembly was a fast and easy install, about an hour each fan, you must spend the time to carefully think through exactly what you are trying to accomplish and and the placement of the fan box outlet. For me it worked out perfect as my goal was to circulate the hot ceiling air so my air conditioning air return could efficiently cool the house and also have a beautiful living room fan that matched my style.  I also realized how useful the sense me feature with the fan light is for going up and down a staircase at night is. Now I don't even need to hit a light switch.  Also, when I had a question about pairing the two fans with my Nest thermostat and called I actually got a real person that was knowledgable and familiar with their product to answer my question.";"2017-09-18T17:06:56-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=902021647&type=Purple%20Software";"902021647";386;"en";"POSITIVE"

After reading other comments below, the biggest issue is understanding how each mode (Nest, Smart Cooling, sleep, scheduling) work and interact with each other and after six weeks of observation: The UI is basic and the UX is terrible… I set one fan up with Nest, Smart Cooling, SenseMe, a couple schedules, and sleep mode and to understand which modes take priority over the other and so forth and as a user, I had zero idea which mode was “active”. That night I configured the fan in my bedroom with sleep mode, but also had SenseMe turned on and woke up to the fan not moving, so I turned off all the modes and just use the remote to manually turn them on and off. It seems like Haiku designed their “smart” product/app just on cool ideas without actually working through the details.

I have never reviewed an app in my life until now… so what sparked me? I flew out of town today for two weeks and forgot to turn one of my fans off. Since I have been using the fans manually, I figured, just like I can do in the Nest app, login to the app via my iPhone and turn the fan off (outside my network *just like Nest…again*) and to no surprise you CAN NOT connect to your fans if you’re not on the same WIFI network. The reason most people get smart devices is to be able to control them when they are not presently around them.

Recommendations
- Allow users to control their fans via app when they are not in the same WIFI network.
- Allow users to control their fans via app on multiple devices. I was expecting to login to the app on my iPad and everything on my iPhone be there, just like every other app in the world… nope. It searches for fans on the network; they are no longer broadcasting on the network as I already set them up… As I type this, I am now thinking I can make them broadcast again so my iPad picks them up then turn broadcasting off… which only leads me to believe that is currently impossible to control the fans outside of the network as the Haiku fan doesn’t communicate to any cloud… which leads me to…
- User account in app: I created an account in the app. Then I went to the website to see if I could sign in and connect to my fan to turn if off there and I realized that the account I created in the app is completely different then the website; after 20 failed login attempts and then successfully creating a new account with the same creds. 
- Provide better user feedback in the UI. If I set a fan to use Nest and I also have in on Smart Cooling with a schedule… provide some sort of “The fan will turn on and off with the nest no matter if you turn Smart Cooling On, with a speed of 0. Schedules override all modes… You can configure all the modes in each schedule, so you don’t need to configure any modes…”";"2018-07-29T20:45:19-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=902021647&type=Purple%20Software";"902021647";584;"en";"POSITIVE"

They work fantastically with the Nest to help control the temp in each of the rooms we have them in. As the temp in the room goes up, the fans will automatically go up in speed to maintain the temp in the room without the central air kicking on. We have seen a reduction in AC use with these fans and I feel they are paying for themselves in our house. They keep the rooms very comfortable and I will be adding additional fans soon. Yes the cost is high, but they are silent and work. I feel the instruction manual was simple to follow and I installed the fans myself. Much easier to do then a conventional fan. The app controls the fans and lights and is easy to use. You can turn them on or off, turn the light on and off and even program the unit to shut off if you leave the room. It knows when you return. All functions are on the app and it has worked flawlessly for us. Highly recommend. You can even tie several units together to work as one.

The app is good, I think it could possibly have a little more user interface help to for users to clarify and identify features and capabilities.

Good App. No remote access when traveling.";"Made in Lexington Kentucky, this fan epitomizes ""Made in America"" at its highest quality. The app is good, but a few quirks. The whoosh mode on the app is useless. While most app functions are the same as the handheld remote, whoosh does not work unless you stay on that screen for a ridiculously long time. Tech support was knowledgeable but was not able to offer a solution. Otherwise, the app works great when you are connected to your home wifi. I have become so adjusted to home automation working wherever I am traveling, I get annoyed by the app when I forget to turn off porch fan and leave. I hope for HomeKit integration now that Apple no longer requires hardware chips for HomeKit integration in iOS 11.

Since my two other indoor fans have sense-me technology, they cut off automatically but I would still like traveling access to these fans too.

My first fan is a 60"" in my living room (17' ceiling). I've ordered another 60"" fan for my master bedroom (11' ceiling).

But the app ALWAYS forgets my preferred temperature settings for smart cooling and sleep mode whenever I make any adjustment to the fan speed manually, via Alexa or via the remote. 

For example, I set my preferred temp to 68° during normal daytime smarter cooling mode. If I turn off the fan or change its speed with the remote or Alexa, the preferred temp is permanently changed, always to something higher, like 73°. My guess is it's the actual ambient temp in the room at the time I turn off the fan, so it assumes that must be my desired temp always. Same behavior in sleep mode. It's infuriating, and the only real flaw in an otherwise excellent experience. PLEASE FIX THIS! It's unreasonable to have to reset the preferred temp in the app every single time I turn off the fan or change its speed.

Based on this it get a solid 3 stars. Where it lacks in order to get the other 2 stars: 

1. No Apple HomeKit integration (or IFTTT for that matter)
2. Only works within Wifi LAN. i.e. no remote functionality. Forgot to turnoff the fan? Oh well... 
3. The User Interface while barely functional, looks like a ""minimal lowest common denominator cross-platform framework kit"" vanilla package based job and it shows... 
    For example, there's no dynamic updating of the fan speed... The slider to set the light intensity has to be clicked each time to raise or lower the brightness, etc. 
4. How about opening a support ticket with the serial # of your fan pre-filled in?  No such luck. 
5. How about a copy of the manual? Nope, it's just another link to the website... 
6. How about a ""store"" integration to purchase replacement parts, accessories etc that matches your fan / lights etc? Nope on that too... 
7. How about any interesting stat collection, or access to sensor data etc. (temp, length on, etc.) nope on that too.

It's a bare-bones remote control app for the fans and doesn't go much further than that... Yes, it has the basics, you can turn on / off the features, you can schedule some things, you can kinda do some integration with nest thermostats, etc. But is it an exceptional blow me away wow app deserving of 5 stars? Nah, I think they can do more and better.";"2017-07-07T16:14:10-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=902021647&type=Purple%20Software";"902021647";279;"en";"POSITIVE"

I only use the app if my alexa is acting wonky but it also works perfectly. Lots of stuff to choose from on their website that can get pricey but if you can afford it they are worth every dollar.

I may have regroup/re-pair the haiku fan and the lights - not as straight forward as it should be.

Update: took sometime to re-group the haiku lights, the haiku switch, and the haiku fan w/light to the same group again. Took several attempts for the groups to “apply” for magically they are all part of the same group again. And Amazon Alexa recognizes them again.
