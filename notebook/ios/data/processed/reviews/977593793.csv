The buttons are great! The batteries have lasted for over a year so far, and get used daily. The Bluetooth range is excellent in a 3200sq home and has never let me down. If it doesn’t work, Homeseer has always been the culprit (shame on you Homeseer).
Even so, Homeseer really expands the otherwise limited functionality of the buttons.

The Bad:
First off, for a company all about connectivity and networking - it should be able to find networked attached devices without asking for the password on the bottom of the device.

Second, the app loses connection with the hub frequently while programming it.

Lastly, why the forced portrait mode? I use the keyboard with an iPad Pro and switch back and forth between Homeseer and Flic to test things out. REALLY annoying.";"2021-10-17T18:50:09-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=977593793&type=Purple%20Software";"977593793";135;"en";"NEGATIVE"

Developers PLEASE READ: roughly ⅓ of the time when I first get in the car and try to use it, the app will not execute my music commands. I’ve tried lots of troubleshooting, but even when it doesn’t execute commands, the button is still connected to my phone (as evidenced by the “Connected” status in my Bluetooth settings). I’ll even open the flic app and it will show that the button is connected, but will not recognize presses. Sometimes, it counts presses and still doesn’t execute. I’ve found the only way to get it to work when this happens is to turn my Bluetooth (totally) off in settings and then turn it back on and ensure it’s connected in the flic app. Sometimes it takes 2 or 3 tries. It’s incredibly frustrating because I never know when it’s going to happen, and it defeats the goal of not using my phone while driving.

I will upgrade this to 5 stars if this is fixed.  In order to use this I have to reorganize all my playlists such there are no songs more than 1 folder down, which is prohibitive.
