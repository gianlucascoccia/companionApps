I bought a stereo pair of speakers that I use heavily, based on my years of great experiences with many Oppo products. Unfortunately, they decided to get out of the hardware business shortly thereafter. But they still supported the app for a while, so it was not a total loss. Until now. After iOS 13 came out, the app crashed right after startup. Which renders the stereo pair totally inoperable. I can play through one speaker without using the app, but strangely I only get one channel of audio. So basically I have two very expensive bricks.

Update. So a year later they released a new version, claiming it fixes the iOS 13 problem. Do not believe it. The app still crashes on startup. Two expensive speakers are still bricks.";"2020-05-17T13:09:32-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1016797038&type=Purple%20Software";"1016797038";134;"en";"POSITIVE"

However, it seems no one at oppo even tried to use it on ios 13 device. When the screen of ios device goes off and you switch it back on, Sonica app restarts and if you were deep in some albums or tracks, you are just thrown to the home screen and have to start from the beginning.  Awful update. I suggest to stay away from Oppo products. Whether it is audio or smartphones, such support just shows how company stands behind their products.

This is not the case. Shows that the company doesn’t care for the satisfaction of its long standing customers, but instead just the revenue they produce from their current product line up.

For reference, when I tried reaching out they replied “thank you for bringing up your concern”. Have not received any further correspondence since.";"2021-05-04T10:38:14-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1016797038&type=Purple%20Software";"1016797038";88;"en";"POSITIVE"

The fact that this is the only remote available for the DAC makes it all the more painful.  It requires multiple clicks just to get a fine grain volume control with up and down arrows.  The app seems to disconnect with the device every time the phone or iPad goes to sleep and goes back to the default screen requiring multiple clicks again to get back to the last screen I was using.  I really hope Oppo improves this app to bring it on par with the quality of the DAC or better yet makes a physical remote available.";"2017-07-22T09:16:53-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1016797038&type=Purple%20Software";"1016797038";113;"en";"POSITIVE"

What’s more it’s the only option for controlling many of their components that they didn’t think to include a standard IR remote with. Volume control and input switching are buried deep in the app, which crashes about 50% of the time during loading. It’s enough to lead me to sell the DAC it controls, or at best move it to a different room where I don’t need a remote to control it. I wish I could give it a half star.";"2017-12-02T19:10:13-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1016797038&type=Purple%20Software";"1016797038";94;"en";"POSITIVE"

Also integrated web radio (via URL) would be great.
