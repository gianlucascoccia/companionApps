My C34S-X4 camera either stopped writing to my TF card (when. motion detected) or the App doesn’t recognize anything since February 29th (which happened to be a leap year day).  I’ve rebooted and tried deleting some of the previously recorded files to free up space- but still can’t get it to start recording again.
The App “calendar” does not show any dates after February 29, 2020 as being accessible.
Seems to be an App problem/bug as the camera continues to work great and I can take snapshots and record video to the system album etc without a problem.
Would love a solution to be able to continue to give good reviews for the products.";"2020-03-06T19:41:57-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=642266858&type=Purple%20Software";"642266858";131;"en";"POSITIVE"

All other apps provide notifications as expected. Tested Eye4 app on another iPhone with same result. All iPhones at most recent version of iOS. Updated all camera firmware.

Notifications feature is the most important to me as I use it for deliveries etc. The app is now almost useless to me. It does have the ability to email motion capture notification and that seems to be working ok. So for now I have set up a mail rule on my computer to alert me instead of using the Eye4 app for notifications. This is a poor work around and inconvenient enough for me to consider replacing the cameras with another brand.

I like the old version better. Before was able to Talk then quickly hit Listen. 

Now, I'm not sure what to do. Intercom, Talk, then Cancel then Listen??

I tried connecting the camera via Ethernet chord (which wouldn’t work because the only one is in my office) and the camera finnaly connected to my phone.

Just stop with updates your app team needs IT specialist that can write code. Constantly disappointed. By the way, did uninstall then install. 

With new update- unable to even log in to se my cameras. This problem is typical with their updates. Once they fix it ( could be a couple of weeks) and if it works fine for you, do not update to any of their newer versions.

Update: app doesn't let me log in and password retrieval does not work- also states their server has issues. * the older app on my other devices which I did not update work fine.

New update: app doesn't work with iOS 10. Developer needs to stay on top of things. This happens too often.

To the developers, without iOS 10 compatibility all of your products are utterly useless. It should be noted that a quality company that has multiple products that require an app for its functionality should put its resources into app development. This situation of nonfunctional system compatibility should not be tolerated- it says a lot about your company.";"2017-06-20T07:25:48-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=642266858&type=Purple%20Software";"642266858";193;"en";"NEGATIVE"
