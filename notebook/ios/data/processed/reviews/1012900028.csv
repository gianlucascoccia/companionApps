-be able to fast forward playback. Yes it has an activity mark, but I‚Äôd rather be able to scroll through a 4 hour window by fast forwarding. 2x, 4x 10x fast forward.

1. For some reason, it locks at 6am constantly for me when trying to review past recordings. 

2.  It will only consistently show recorded video up until the previous hour.  So if you‚Äôre looking for a recording from 10:30 and it‚Äôs currently 10:35, odds are you can‚Äôt see the footage you want until after 11. 

Any interruption kicks you out of the video you‚Äôre looking at, meaning you need to roll the dice and try and get it working again. 

For some reason, if you reload the past footage 20 times or so, eventually you can get to the footage after the typical break per hour.  So in the example above, if I really needed to see the 10:35 footage, reloading the camera two dozens times will  eventually load the footage from the last hour until the current time.";"2018-03-09T09:46:50-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1012900028&type=Purple%20Software";"1012900028";155;"en";"NEUTRAL"

Also I get notifications even when I have it set to home mode. My understanding is these features are adjustable and I have done so with the same results. 
Another bothersome issue is when we turn off the system the cameras seem to stay on appear to be recording all the time. I am also unsure how secure this app is can others view my cameras easily?
Also Touch ID would be a great addition and add a level of security. Also more device control. I'd like to be able to add a powered door lock and window sensors. 
I'll change my rating as this service improves.

After the last update the app no longer connects to my cameras and nothing I try fixes the issue. I called the App support hotline and even though it said my call was first in line, I waited on hold for over 30 minutes. I eventually gave up. I will wait 7 business days then I'm returning these now non functioning cameras......

Everyone, to fix the app crashing issue, you must delete all your event and motion history. Once my wife and I did this it started working again.

Also, if you mount it to the wall the camera doesn't just stay pointing where you put it because the cord pulls it down. So it has to be sitting and it has to have something on the back of it so it doesn't fall forward. Sounds like a nuisance but it's not. I like the quality a lot!

1.- Home screen with real time video on all the installed cameras.
2.- Ability to arrange the order of the cameras as the user wants/need.
3.- Share specific camera between family, friend or security personnel.
4.- Share photos/videos taken from the phone/tablet to the people you want.
5.- Share the pictures taken from the alarm/motion sensor to the people that the user wants/need.
6.- Add fast forward, reverse, pause, play to the videos you are reviewing.
7.- Add the ability to watch recorded videos right from the phone/tablet without the need to be in the same wifi network.

I hope the developer understand the importance of these improvements to the actual user and also to future users.";"2017-02-23T14:30:04-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1012900028&type=Purple%20Software";"1012900028";137;"en";"POSITIVE"

App is more stable. Still have automatic scheduling issue described below. 

2-23-2017 update:
I thought the update would help with the bugs I initially discussed. NOPE. Now the app crashes after being open about 2 seconds. SAD! ONE STAR!

Previous review: Overall, the design of this app is intuitive and easy to use. The biggest annoyance is that the automatic mode scheduling feature does not work. I set times for the different modes to automatically activate, but it never works, so I am forced to manually change the mode from ""home"" to ""sleep"" every night (and change it back to ""home"" in the morning.) Secondly, trying to access cloud footage from the live stream view causes the app to hang. I am assuming this is because I have not subscribed to the cloud storage, but an error message should appear rather than the app freezing.";"2017-04-22T14:47:35-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1012900028&type=Purple%20Software";"1012900028";146;"en";"NEGATIVE"
