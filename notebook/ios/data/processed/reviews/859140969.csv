But now, it no longer does its job either. It does not allow any device to be controlled if you're not connected to the same Wi-Fi network.

But the app is freaking stupidly designed by someone who lives in 90s Nokia time. Adding a routinely schedule is exhaustingly hard. 1) The number dial looks like iOS dial but does not support inertia scrolling. Meaning it moves 3 steps max when you try to set it from 00 to 30. You need to do this 3 times for the hour, the minute and the second. 
And 2) annoyingly, you are not allowed to set up a duration! Instead you have to set an ""on"" action first and then a separate ""off"" action!!! For every single freaking schedule! 
Worse, 3) you are not allowed to copy and paste schedules, so meaningless repetitive works is the only way to go.
It's apparent that the company knew nothing about usability. They don't even care to use apple's ready-made components to make a no-brained timer app. In conclusion, this app is big disgrace and it ruins an otherwise great product.";"2015-12-11T05:01:35-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=859140969&type=Purple%20Software";"859140969";166;"en";"NEGATIVE"

I bought a bunch of them for a second home only to find out that Wemo never invented any way to use them in more than one home, so the Wemo app cannot control any of my lights in my second home. 

To resolve this issue, I replaced them all with these Wiwo switches. The setup was dramatically easier, and faster. The responsiveness of this app is 10 times faster than the Wemo app, and this app has worked flawlessly since day one for me. I can turn my lights on and off whether I am on WIFI or my regular cell service. 

The other reviews are clearly fake because while writing this, I turned off my WIFI and switched the light in the other room on and off six times. Their response is instant. FAR FAR faster than the Wemo devices in my other home. 

Not to mention, the WIWO products are HALF the price as the Wemo and they look better and are smaller!";"2017-07-28T23:40:13-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=859140969&type=Purple%20Software";"859140969";181;"en";"POSITIVE"

When you open the app it displays the last known status as the current status which is often misleading as I have timers to turn off at regular times.  So it shows on when it's off.  Then if you toggle it, there is no way to know the status.

59;1321201442;"Mar??????";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id41051798";"3.3";4;"Good Overall- has improved a lot since March 2015";"I have over 28 Orvibo wifi sockets in my home, and office. This app controls all of them on one app and with multiple phones. 

I first used this app in March 2015. There was very little directions, as most was written in Chinese. After playing around with the different functions, I have uncovered how to use most all of the advanced functions, and the basic functions. Now (1/2016) they have made many improvements to the app, and to the instructions.  

The biggest help I uncovered was that you need to be sure your Router /modem allow as many WIFI connections as you have devices, meaning, if you have 3 wifi laptops, and 3 smartphones, and add 5 wifi sockets,  you need to have a router/modem that allows 11 wifi devices to connect to it... Or you will get frustrated when the time comes that you want to use all your devices!!  Something will be left looking for a slot to connect, if your router/modem only allows for 10 devices (as most devices from your internet service providers allow either 5 or 10 devices max to connect!! 

The next thing is to be sure your phone/iPad is connected to the same wifi as your Orvibo/wiwo app and devices were set up on!! Other wise, you will get a frustrating notice saying you must be on local network, OR your devices are not online.

If you have a good router/modem, and follow the above suggestions, these wifi sockets are the best thing since the invention of chocolate!! 

The app has improved, and you have to trust that the updates are necessary, because most updates are described in Chinese. Since I can't read Chinese, I don't know what improvements they are making, but ultimately they have improved the effectiveness of the app or the devices. 

I love these devices, and rely on them to help increase my energy savings and security. I can turn off any lights not needed from anywhere.  I have a teenager, so that is important.";"2016-01-23T11:54:42-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=859140969&type=Purple%20Software";"859140969";337;"en";"POSITIVE"
