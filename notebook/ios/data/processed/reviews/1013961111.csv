These are alright for simple home use. The quality of the video both during the day, and at night are sufficient. You can clearly see the persons face, and that is all that really matters. They have always detected motion well. They were decently priced. 

I don’t love that they require an email, and a phone number. Pick one. It just feels extra intrusive. No support team needs both on file. I also do not love that the notifications are hit or miss. I have everything set up with my preferences in both my phone settings, and the app settings yet most of the time I do not get any. So that means I have to open the app to see if anything is captured. Which makes the live video mic basically useless. If you want to relay a message verbally via the camera to family when they enter the home you will likely not be notified of its detecting motion. If you want to shout at an intruder that you’re watching them, also useless. That is a fix that is completely on the app end seeing as my notifications work for every other app I use. 

So overall a decent camera, easy to set up, but crappy on the notification end. If that could be fixed I would say this would be a pretty great system.";"2021-02-18T07:32:13-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1013961111&type=Purple%20Software";"1013961111";247;"en";"POSITIVE"

I didn’t want to go through the headache of hiring a professional to hardwire everything. So from that perspective, great idea. Problem is I find this system full of issues. Overall, it’s not dependable. Capturing thumbnails sometimes works, but most often doesn’t. The latency of live view is terrible, probably 10-15 seconds, and that’s if it works. My cameras are within 20feet of my router, and my sync module is literally next to the router so the latency can’t be because of my network which is a 300MB download. Sometimes the motion sensor will trigger but the camera won’t turn on in time And completely miss the action. Live stream audio cuts out frequently. Etc etc etc. When it works, it’s great. But there’s constant issues. I find that it doesn’t work more often than it works. Even night mode is patchy, image quality is great on one camera, but terrible of the other two. I also think the App is behind others like SimpliSafe. I’ll keep playing around with it, but it doesn’t always work and that’s annoying. Oh, and this is pretty annoying, but the whole system is sort of useless unless you sign up for their cloud service which will cost you $100 / year if you have more than one device.

I’ve been happy with the video quality, and the ease of use. The app is easy to quickly use, and the cameras have survived outside in the elements for a year. Claims of a 2 year battery life seem exaggerated at best, however. The o YL way you’re getting 2 years of battery life is if you have your cameras basically disarmed for a majority of the hours in the day, which kind of defeats the purpose of a security camera system.  But I bought it expecting that, and I am not disappointed. Batteries last about 6 months, give or take. Would I like 2 years between battery changes? Of course, but six months is still impressive. 

As for the app; it’s good! My one request would be that they move the ability to schedule arm and disarm times for each individual camera, rather than the system as a whole. I have cameras in front of my house, and one in my backyard. When my kids are playing out back they’re constantly triggering the backyard camera, which drives the battery life into the ground. I’d like to be able to disarm that one at a scheduled time, while leaving the front cameras armed. I know I could do it manually, but that sort of defeats the purpose.

I can move these cameras pretty much anywhere I wish within 100 feet of the house. When there is too much activity from the wind blowing a bush within camera range, I can turn it off.  The night vision is great. It is not in color. I watch deer, raccoons, groundhogs very clearly. They are so sensitive that it will pick up movement when something or someone it at the outer edge of the camera range.

It will also tell you when a camera has high use and alerts you if the battery is low. 

I will say, the night vision is amazing! I am really impressed of how bright the image is. The camera sensitivity was set to 6 and it was picking up birds flying by. Adjusted it to 5 and it doesn’t, catch them anymore.  The mount that came with it are simple. You can tilt up/down and swivel it left and right.

I don’t understand this, and more importantly it’s not serving it’s purpose if it doesn’t capture people walking up to my house.
2) Notifications are almost non existent.  Sometimes I’ll get a notification on my lock screen, sometimes I won’t.  There is never a notification on the app icon, not until I open the app and then exit, at which point the number of notifications shows up on the icon.

Yikes! The recent update puts the delete button right where the share/save button used to be. Anyone who has been regularly saving videos is set up to accidentally delete instead of save. Also, the share button is now positioned right next to the delete button, and so is very easy to accidentally tap, especially on a iPhone vs iPad. Do the software designers actually use the app?

[Edited: the April 2021 update speeds up the save to file function; it only takes a few seconds to save each video to file now. Thanks!!! —> It *WAS* a slow and annoying process, having to save one video at a time - taking about 1/2 minute each save.] 

By moving the share/delete buttons the save process is slowed down by (1) needing to break the habit of quickly tapping where the share button used to be, and (2) having to be very careful to make sure you don’t tap the delete button by accident since they’re so close together. Yes, there is a pop-up “do you want to delete” verification when you tape delete, but it’s easy to accidentally tap “yes”.

One glaring lack in functionality is the ability to add a camera/date/time stamp to saved video clips. The data is all there, and is used as the filename when saved as a file.

1. Please move the share and delete buttons back to their previous locations. ASAP.

2. Please FINALLY add a feature to save multiple clips at once.

I have been using old iPads’ FaceTime to watch and communicate with him (while I’m working in another part of the house, or outside doing yard work).  I need to keep a constant eye and/or ear on him so to interrupt any potential fall situation he tries to put himself into.  

Ownership :  I just set up my account, app, and camera today.  Camera = indoor Mini

First response in meeting my need: disappointed 
- Live sound & stream last less than a couple of minutes, then there is a short lived prompt to continue. If you miss it, then you have to restart the stream.  I need it to be a continuous feed, until I manually end it.  The Mini is corded for its power, so power saving is not of a concern.

Features: The motion sensor works well
Notifications come through quickly
- for my need, my FIL could be on the ground by the time I get the alert and get the stream moving again, so while they are nice, the process of getting from alert to live stream is too slow.
Audio - 2 way is nice & appears to be clear enough for me to be heard coming from the camera.

Important to note: the video and sound have about a 2 second delay.

Likely, if you are reading this in the App Store then the purchase is already made.

I have had a total of close to 20 Blink cameras located at two properties for at least 4 years.  Some of the cameras are armed 24/7, others are on from dusk to dawn.  In the four years I had to change batteries in maybe six cameras when they alerted me to a low battery condition.  I recently changed all the batteries just because it has been four years. 
Just so you understand, these cameras go off all the time, with people during the day and animals at night. 

Great system. Great price.  No monthly fee. 

Only shortcoming is that they could easily provide additional control over individual
cameras.  

For example, I want to know anytime a vehicle enters our circular driveway during the day or approaches the front door as well as when someone approaches a locked garage door in the middle of the night.  But the alert sound should be able to be set differently as one event is usually benign, while the other could very well be ominous. 

Also, you can arm and disarm the entire system anytime you like, but it would be better to arm/disarm cameras individually.  For example, maybe you want to arm a basement stairwell door 24/7 because it is not normally used, but only arm your outside pool camera after dark when friends or service people are not usually walking about. .";"2021-03-03T20:45:03-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1013961111&type=Purple%20Software";"1013961111";237;"en";"POSITIVE"

I wish the camera software could be updated so that motion detection picks up less false positives and has a higher detection range. For example, if a car is moving at a distance I believe this should be easily picked up; or a person walking at a distance on a yard. I have a hard time getting full coverage in certain areas where my cameras are located because of this. This happens with a high sensitivity set as well.

Also please add a way to add notifications for when there is a software/firmware update.

I tested the indoor Blink Mini and was able to run across the room where the camera is located without the camera detecting motion, please correct this. I was wearing black and the walls are all white, so I assumed this would be captured but wasn’t. Moving at a slower pace works as expected.

Or, you can turn down the sensitivity to a point where a Mac truck wouldn’t trigger them. 

As simple solution to most problems would be quite simple. Make it so the system could be globally disarmed for a preset period of time. Unfortunately this seems to be beyond the comprehension of the company. Or they plainly just don’t give a crap.";"2021-03-06T09:37:18-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1013961111&type=Purple%20Software";"1013961111";196;"en";"NEGATIVE"

I agree the app was pretty archaic, and visually it looks great now, but with the new layout having ALL actionable buttons stacked at the bottom, every time I’m trying to manage my videos (I.e filter/ edit to bulk delete them) I end up hitting the community button when I hit delete.... Over and over and over and over again because the padding between the two areas is so small. This is super frustrating when I’ve taken the time to select specific videos to delete and then I have to make my selections all over again.

I’m a 30 something working in tech so it’s not a user inexperience issue. It’s so annoying and I know I can’t be the only one with this issue.

3) Blink people are very responsive. If you call in, they will take the time to walk you through install. While it didn’t work they were going to send me a new sync module.

I had forgotten about an I pad someone gave me last October. I tried all the corrective steps they wanted me to do with my older I phone and everything went smooth. Installed system, updated software and everything works.
Love the system so far. Only complaint is you either disarm whole system or let to run all cameras. If Blink would allow each camera location to be armed or disarmed, it would be a lot better. 

Things to check if you have issues:
Make sure your connecting to your modem with a 2.4 gig channel. Make sure you set up the system before mounting cameras.
Use the most current phone or tablet you have. Even if you have to use a neighbors to set up. Calm customer service. Google blink customer service for the number. Not on instructions.

Once installed my old phone works the system perfectly.

I like the security zones and privacy zones because these are set up in a place where there is a little bit of street and a little bit of the neighbors. So, I can mostly prevent them from activating when a car drives by or my neighbors leave their garages.

However, there is no user model. My spouse has to log into the same account as me on their phone, and if I delete videos, their app crashes. Being able to assign multiple users to the same account would fix this.

Right now, we have some workers on a landscape project going through the area repeatedly during daytime hours. When it records the first video, I’d like to be able to suspend any triggering (that is, disarm) for one hour because, say, they are unloading a truck. But, no, I have to disarm the system entirely and then remember to rearm it.

We mostly rely on videos syncing locally, and keep very few cloud stored. If there were a way to classify videos into separate folders (“random person peers into yard”, “wildlife crosses at night”, etc) accessing the cloud recorded videos would not be the pain of navigating a long list that it is now.

I moved to this XT2 system because of the price point, I got a hub and 3 cameras covering the whole exterior of my house for less than the price of 1 Nest. Also not paying a monthly fee is huge. 

They just need to catch up a little still. The cameras have issues pretty much every day or two. One of them will say “live view failed” and just wont work at all for a few hours. Eventually it comes back. That’s even with pulling the batteries to restart it and making sure the connection is good. 

Also there’s a few usability things that I got used to that I wish this system had. It reeeaaallly needs to ability to change notification settings for each camera. I don’t need a notification every time movement in the yard happens, but I do still want it to record the video. On the other hand, I do want a notification every time someone comes to my front door. Need those options. 

Also it needs to alert to motion immediately, but doesn’t. It records the ENTIRE CLIP and then notifies you. And you can’t see the camera until the clip is done recording either. It’s crazy. So someone could come to my door, and if I have it set to record a 30 second clip, I won’t get notified until the full 30 seconds is done recording.

Our young cat recently passed away due to a heart attack when we were not home. I became paranoid about my other cats so I got a few of these cameras to keep tabs on them when I have to leave. They have a nice view area so I can see multiple points in my home. The app flaws, however: 

-I wish you could see a live view of multiple cameras in a single instance. When you look at your system overview page, you just see previous stills of those cameras and not their live view

-switching between live views takes a moment. When you leave one camera to go view another, it says “please wait, live view in progress” for several moments before you’re able to switch to another camera. 

-when you’re viewing a camera, after 30 seconds or so it asks “continue?” And if you don’t click continue, the feed will end. Continuous viewing would be nice. I assume some people use these as baby monitors as well so I think the feature would be handy all around.

Unfortunately, you get all app features if you subscribe to upload recordings to their cloud, and they lock certain in-app features if you save recordings locally to a Sync Module.

Also, cloud users are provided a thumbnail preview on their clips - a feature which is also blocked for Sync Module users.

It takes way too long for a live view to end. I’ll end the live view on one camera and immediately try to start a live view on another camera, but that irritating  “Please wait. Live view in progress.” message shows. It takes several seconds for the app to realize the first live view has ended. Security cameras are something that should have a near instant response time. I’m 100% sure it’s not my internet connection since I have fiber with 1gig down AND up. I’ve been in IT for over 15 years, so I’m guessing the lag is coming from the app or Blink’s servers.

ISSUE #2
When in a live view on iPhone in LANDSCAPE, you cannot tap the “Continue?” button at the bottom. It works fine on iPad, just not iPhone in landscape.

ISSUE #3
There is no way to change the timeout duration before the “Continue?” button appears during a live view. Being able to increase or decrease the timeout duration (or completely disable timeout if the camera is plugged into an outlet) would be awesome!

Finally (this isn’t significant enough to be an issue), during a live view in landscape, the “Hold to talk” text is slightly outside the dark gray background.

What users have been asking for is the ability to schedule certain cameras (not disable the entire darned system on a schedule), and allow a camera to be disabled for a pre-determined amount of time. The cameras are battery-poered, so every time they record or detect motion, they eat into the battery, and that “2-year” life quickly becomes 6 months. If I could disable my driveway camera for 15 minutes while I pull away and pull in, I wouldn’t degrade the battery life, and wouldn’t miss much activity if it auto-armed.

My phone blows up with motion alerts when my cat decides to enter a surveilled room. I’d still like the footage but don’t need the constant iOS alerts.

Occasionally, spider webs are an issue-not a big deal. Peppermint oil is a spider deterrent .

Use lithium AA batteries as recommended. Good for a year, at least.  I have the switcher located next to my modem/router which is central to all cameras-within 100 feet. 

None of my 8 cams have failed, even being outdoors in harsh Michigan winter. Should one fail? I’ll replace it.

I have but one minor complaint: Blink cams are seriously wide angle. Too wide to pick out much detail. I’d love for Blink to come up with a narrow view “telephoto” to focus on doorways etc where the cam can’t be immediately located.

 Blink App has been updated several times and now fully functional in horizontal-landscape display(iPad users)

If you have a sync module with a decent flash drive inserted, you can locally store video and still download it via the app.  You do NOT have to pay the monthly subscription: the initial sales materials mentioned this (It’s slower, but free), but every subsequent email I received, every FAQ & help page I read, all subsequent documentation concealed this, leaving you with the impression that your system would useless without a monthly subscription.

I bought a 3-cam pack and a couple add-ones so have 5 total. I also have 5 Nest cameras for comparison. My specific dislikes for Blink are:

1) when you open the app, you see still pictures (from potentially a long time ago) and not a live video stream. Nest’s app starts streaming as soon as you open the app, which saves clicks and saves time.

2) blink only allows streaming one camera at a time. Nest lets you stream as many as you want, so the dashboard view gives quick visibility into your whole yard/house. Blink requires you to manually open each camera after closing the previous one, which makes a getting a “complete” view pretty time consuming and unwieldy - especially when you have a lot of cameras 

3) when streaming a camera, blink makes you click “continue” every 30 seconds or it turns off. Nest streams until you close the app. I understand the need to prevent unnecessary streaming but 30 seconds could be the default and maybe let users configure it up to 5 or 10 minutes at a time";"2018-08-19T09:57:58-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1013961111&type=Purple%20Software";"1013961111";190;"en";"POSITIVE"

One feature that should be added to the app IMMEDIATELY: Provide users the option to automatically save ALL LIVE VIEWS to smartphone. Otherwise a live view is lost as it does not save that to the cloud (like ‘Ring’ products and others do). This change would require no changes to the back-end cloud service as the App would be handling retention of the clip, as viewed.

That’s a bug. If a schedule is global, it should turn on ALL cameras when the schedule begins and turn them ALL off when it’s over.

I started with all cameras being used for Security, but later repositioned one of the cameras to monitor a wildlife path through my yard. The amount of activity recorded at night is amazing. 

The motion detection and infrared can be adjusted up or down to meet the needs of the specific location.

Problem with Blink is delay feed. Once it alerts you via notification and you attempt to open the app to view the cam it’s too late to catch the action. Now if the camera picks up and record there is also a delay. If you changed the settings to a point of sensitivity it detects even any bug that flies and cross the camera path resulting in false alarm.

We bought this to keep an eye on our 2 young boys while they play upstairs.
Here is my take on the system.

Cons: 
One feature, which I do not like is that it will only show you footage for a little while then turn off. You then have to press play again to view.

The buggy issues are as follows:
- it many times takes many seconds to load the video feed, so it is very laggy.
-it will just cut the video feed short
-you have to exit the app to get the video feed to work again

Pro:
- video image is clear and nice

Overall, it is not worth the frustration to have. If you are just using it to view who rang your doorbell, it would do the job, but just go with a baby monitor system to keep an eye on little ones.";"2021-09-13T05:04:31-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1013961111&type=Purple%20Software";"1013961111";159;"en";"POSITIVE"

- add ability to just snap a single still image
   o why? Same as above really because the motion fires so often in wind it wore out the lithium batteries in 2 weeks not 2 years even with a ton of image masking. And it filled up the s3 bucket...

1). I want different notifications/rules for each camera.  It’s insane this isn’t a thing.  Yes you can do it by controller but I only need one controller and the interface when I use multiple controllers is terrible.  

2) The early notification feature (admittedly beta) is bad.  When I get it I click it and get taken to live feed.  Hate it.  Don’t care.  Usually the person left by then.  No way to distinguish between normal motion detection.  It should be a different color and/or give you two options — live feed or see the video history.
