I just purchased my second ue ROLL 2 and after pairing them together I couldn't believe the sound coming out of those little speakers. The sound quality is comparable to the Bose wave radio. So why not five stars you might ask, well it took me about three tries to get the two speakers to pair. So maybe and update would improve the reliability of pairing the two speakers quicker. Another feature that would be nice, would be, if I could film a video on my phone while the music's playing. I have the iPhone 6s Plus, as soon as I turn on the camera, The music stops playing. I suppose this is to prevent conflicts with the microphone on my phone. Would it be possible for the ""ue Roll app"" to add a feature where the microphone on my phone could be temporarily switched off while taking a video? Overall I think it's a wonderful app and a great product.";"2016-09-10T10:42:46-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=987657806&type=Purple%20Software";"987657806";175;"en";"POSITIVE"

I called the support system and apparently you have to reset the ROLL after every update. To do this, disconnect the roll from the phone and hold the roll's power button+volume minus for 10 seconds. This should result in the power shutting off. Upon power on the Bluetooth button will flash to indicate a fresh reboot and requirement to reconnect a device. After reconnection, the app should work like before. I hope this helps everyone reading this for this issue.";"2015-08-28T15:57:35-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=987657806&type=Purple%20Software";"987657806";105;"en";"POSITIVE"

After I used the app to update the speaker's firmware, however - the app only ""sees"" the speaker when the speaker is powered off. The app can remotely see the battery life when the speaker is off, and it can remotely power ON the speaker - but once the speaker is on, the app thinks it's no longer connected. Mind you, the phone still plays fine to the speaker, I can control the volume with my iPhone volume buttons as well as my watch ""now playing"" app ‚Äì but I can't use any other features of the App like equalizer, double up, and presumably future firmware updates.

I've tried uninstalling/reinstalling the app as well as repairing the Bluetooth speaker ‚Äî problem is unchanged. 

I called Logitech customer support three times and each time got mysteriously disconnected... Yay.

It won't walk you through going to Bluetooth settings to press the connect button, but if you don't need that help, Kudos and enjoy a great product. 

The manufacturers made a mistake by triggering the suggested download on pairing, making the average user assume you NEED this app. If you WANT this app for config changes or firmware updates, download it.
