My phone gets nonstop motion detection alerts because it even picks up changes in the light. So, perhaps a cloud coming by will set of the alert.

iPhone X users, switch to the mydlink app!
********

I‚Äôve seen this app get updated a few times since I bought my cameras (DCS-8000LH).  However, it still doesn‚Äôt support the screen size of the iPhone X.  In that very same time, Netflix has gone crazy with updates for the iPhone X.  It seems like every other week I get one.  If Netflix can do it, why can‚Äôt D-link?  Also, I agree with many others that the cameras need to capture a small low res picture of what is detected, and that needs to be in the notification sent to the phone.  Then, we can decide if we need to open the app and take more pictures or even record.  Because the cameras don‚Äôt store pictures or video themselves, or to the cloud directly, we‚Äôre at the mercy of the app‚Äôs ability to load in a timely fashion and to finally give us the ability to store them (and it‚Äôs only to the phone storage).  I get that these are budget cameras, and that they‚Äôre ‚Äúcost optimized‚Äù.  However, I‚Äôve been caught at the loading screen of the app while someone is entering into my residence.  In some cases they‚Äôre in and out before the app finishes loading.  This is why we need the cameras to at least take a low res picture when they detect something.  If it can‚Äôt be in the notification, then allow us to enter an email address that the cameras can send pictures to.  Then you don‚Äôt have to worry about storage concerns or cloud server overhead.  Surely the cameras can do that much?

Also, some complaints.....  because how can you fix a problem you don‚Äôt know about?

1.  Your phone reps should never ask you for your password.  They are known to do this during troubleshooting.  I‚Äôve asked 2 of your reps about this and they claim it‚Äôs normal.  Furthermore, they state none of that is recorded in their notes, but yet I can hear typing over the phone.  Call me paranoid, but no company should ever ask for my password.  It just raises too many security concerns, but D-link should already know this right?  After all, your selling ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù cameras.  If you must access the account, reset the password and test.  Never ask.

2.  These cameras don‚Äôt work consistently because of the cellular carriers.  Each time a cellular carrier does an update that blocks access to your cloud, we lose all functionality.  Your reps state this to be correct.

3.  Why does your notification server go down so much?  If I can‚Äôt get stable notifications that my cameras have detected something, that makes them complete useless.  You need a failover solution.  I‚Äôve already seen this happen well over 5 times, and I‚Äôve only owned the cameras for a few months.

4.  Why do I receive notifications when the cameras switch to night mode?  I don‚Äôt need to know when they switch to night mode.  I only need to know when they detect something.";"2018-10-31T11:30:53-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=372571229&type=Purple%20Software";"372571229";499;"en";"NEGATIVE"

The list wouldn't populate, but now that problem has been fixed! So glad because I can now say this is a terrific app to go with my camera viewable from anywhere. My problem still lies with checking in on the camera on a different network than the last time I checked in. For instance I open and view the camera on my phones network, everything is fine. I switch to a nearby wifi network and open the app, the image is stuck for a while before it realizes it needs to change its path making me click ok when the error message pops up and now waiting for it to load up the camera. This is especially bad when you get an alert telling you there's a motion detected and you want to quickly look and see what triggered it. Whatever it is will have discovered and smashed your camera or gone off camera by the time you connect.

I now mainly use a third party app (LiveCams Pro) that's much better (launches quickly and almost instantly shows me the live feeds of my six cameras all on one screen).

This app will notify you of motion detection and when it works, it's great, but you get a ton of false hits, and I get a lot of ""camera disconnected"" alerts which don't seem valid (the camera feed is there when I check). There's no way to turn off just camera notifications and leave the motion ones as far as I can tell.

To be fair, dlink has improved the app since I got it. You can now do things like firmware updates via the app, which it didn't used to let you do. I also had two newer model cameras that I couldn't get the dlink Mac software to initialize so I couldn't add them to my dlink account and therefore they wouldn't show up here in the app. (The cameras worked fine in my third-party app.) But then a new update to this app suddenly saw the two missing cameras and allowed me to set them up from this app, a big improvement.";"2015-11-06T23:26:06-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=372571229&type=Purple%20Software";"372571229";222;"en";"POSITIVE"

I also noticed that when viewing HD the frame rate drops to under 10fps or frames per second. I also notice issues when enabling audio sending and receiving I have both turned off to save bandwidth. I also noticed HD feature goes away when you configure video profile #2 to anything other then MJPEG.

Sometimes if you try and try again you will eventually connect and other times it won't work for weeks (not at all exaggerating).  At the time of writing this review it hasn't worked for about a 1 week and counting.  I think the camera itself is good but I am guessing the background ""cloud"" service is where the issue lies.  And you have to use this service  no matter what you are using to access the camera.  It's particularly disturbing given what dLink does as a company...given my experience I probably wouldn't buy a single piece of networking equipment from this company.  I hope this helps but I am guessing if you are looking into this app you have already bought the product...return it not so much to recover your money  but to maintain your sanity.";"2013-02-21T19:08:46-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=372571229&type=Purple%20Software";"372571229";204;"en";"POSITIVE"

This ""swipe"" thing is awful. It takes forever to be detected, then moves a fraction of what I swipe (and I'm talking to the point of being USELESS).  Almost tempted to get rid of this device if THIS is what you guys do for ""updates""- did you even run it through testing?? Very disappointing- feel like I wasted money.
The new update also forces the camera into the ""center"" position, which is NOT helpful or better. With the controls being horrible as is, now anytime I check on my son, I have to go through at least several minutes of swiping the screen, waiting for the camera to get the signal and pan towards where I want, and repeating until I can see if he's asleep or if he's having issues.

Blu-ray, AppleTV, Stereo, etc.  The D-link cameras are the only devices I have that cannot connect to the WiFi by selecting the SSID and entering the password in the GUI --The built-in webpage for configuration.  All of these cameras will only connect if you manually use the WPS feature (if you have it) pressing the button on both camera and router.  I need to move it around on SSID without physical access and so this is a problem.  Every other device out there can do this without WPS why not the D-link?  I tried 3 brands of WiFi router (one with an open source firmware) but WiFi can't connect to any.  The wired cable works fine, so does WPS.

Very disappointing.";"My boyfriend and I recently purchased the DCS-5222L camera for our home and were initially very pleased with it. We are very impressed by the quality of picture both the day and night lenses capture, as well as the panning, motion sensor, and microphone features. 

Imagine how disappointed we were when we discovered how incredibly poorly the IOS app functioned. Neither myself nor my boyfriend were able to get a consistent connection to our home camera via the app. The Mydlink website does not allow us to connect via safari, either. We even drove to the next town, to see if the issue was our cell phone service providers (he has Sprint and I have Verizon), and even at 4 bars of LTE service, we were still unable to connect. 

The reason we purchased your camera was to give us the ability to view it from our smart phones at any time, any place we had internet connection. I was deeply saddened when I had to remove your camera from our wall and box it back up. I am VERY sad that today I will be exchanging it for another brand. 

Because we honestly were SO impressed and pleased at the quality of the camera itself, I wanted to reach out to you and suggest that your company makes some serious improvements to the IOS app. The app reviews are very poor, as many other users seem to have experienced the same issues I do.

Having the ability for the camera to send email alerts when audio is detected above a configurable threshold would be amazing... sadly, the new cameras I just bought from you don't have that feature.  These types of features would really make your products stand out compared to the other manufacturer's IP cameras.

The app has no ability to enable or adjust settings for the snapshot feature. This is the feature that can automatically take a photo(s) if motion is detected. The only way to configure this is by logging into each camera manually via a web browser. They need to add this feature to the app so I can toggle it remotely.

There would be a share feature where you'd select a contact from your device and the app would send an email inviting them to share that camera or cameras. 

2) Add a snooze feature to the motion alerts so that the user can instruct the app to temporarily ignore motion events from specific cameras for a specified time period (e.g. 1 hour)

3) the camera should not only send motion alerts to the smartphone, but accompany it with an image of the motion so that the user can quickly determine whether to ignore the alert without the need for opening the app and connecting to the camera

4) Allow users to set the motion detection cells and adjust overall sensitivity level

Now, with the recent firmware release, the app has prompted us to update the firmware in both our cameras.  We did so, and it states that it completed successfully.  However, when we try to go into the cameras on one of the iphones, the Day/Night feature has what appears to be a caution triangle, and when you click on it, it prompts you to update firmware, again.  This occurs on both cameras, and clicking on upgrade firmware again does not solve the problem.  So now one of our phones cannot access the features of the camera while the other can.
myDlink refuses to respond to support requests, too.  Maybe they are overloaded with all of the bugs that have plagued this app?

2.6.0 = Still not getting the connection speed on LTE:  Only able to connect around 1-3 fps as opposed to 20 fps on LTE like I was getting on version 2.4.4 (best version so far)

2.4.4 = great connection speeds, but needs iPhone 5 support (full screen)
2.4.5 = FAIL
2.4.6 = at least it connects, but no LTE speed like 2.4.4
2.6.0 = new UI looks nice, but same problems as 2.4.6:  no LTE speed like 2.4.4;  needs iPhone5 support (larger display)

So far, 2.4.4 is the best version:  Able to get LTE speed connections with iPhone5 (15+ fps).  All other versions connects very slow (2-3 fps).

I was afraid that the connection might not do as well when not connected to WiFi but I've tested it on LTE and 3G and both work just fine. Reliability probably depends more on your wireless service provider and the type of phone or tablet you have. 

The only configuration I had to do was to update the firmware on my phone. That involved pressing the OK button twice. No big deal. 

Dlink can also stream your camera(s) over their website if you enable that feature.
