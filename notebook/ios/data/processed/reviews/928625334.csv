Not a big deal if you wanted to just hard wire the phone to the speaker, but I want the phone to be playing on multiple speakers as I work in different areas (which requires the app).  Overall the concept is good (multiple wireless speakers playing different things or all the same thing), but the app is lacking a few things to consider.";"2018-09-14T05:49:56-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=928625334&type=Purple%20Software";"928625334";100;"en";"POSITIVE"

Sure you can hard wire your iPod, computer, or phone into one speaker but that's it. If you want to take advantage of the multiple speaker option, the app is necessary, and the app needs a lot of help. I am constantly restarting the app for it to find my speakers and yesterday had to delete the app and reinstall. This app is the life blood of the system and it is only a 1 star. The theory of it is a 4 star, (some things should be better, see above reviews), but currently it needs a lot of help.";"2015-09-21T08:20:51-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=928625334&type=Purple%20Software";"928625334";111;"en";"POSITIVE"

The app should already have all services, unless there is more to it than I know. No amazon music? bring any music or sound from our app to your speakers?  No control from mac or PC yet?  I feel Monster is going to miss the boat like Bose did with beats.  Get on it, Iâ€™m cheering for you.
