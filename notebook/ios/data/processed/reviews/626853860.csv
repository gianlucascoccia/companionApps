I have had a couple of times where I have had to remove the hub and re-set it up to work again.  But I can live with that minor annoyance.  My issues with it are mainly that in this day and age it should be much more user friendly and customizable.  Probably my biggest gripe with it is the lack of a portrait mode.  Using a tablet in landscape mode, especially with the way the app is set up, is very difficult because all the buttons you use the most are right in the middle where you can‚Äôt reach with your thumb while holding the pad.  Portrait mode would allow much easier reach ability and, if you think about it, a normal remote is tall not wide.  Also, it would be nice to be able to arrange buttons and sections, like the number pad and arrow wheel, how you would prefer them.  In other words make the app more customizable, which would make it more user friendly.  Instead of a sidebar on each side for activities (left side) and devices (right side), I would prefer a drop down row of icons from the top that you swipe down to view, like the google home hub has for home controls.  This would keep them hidden and out of the way except when I need them.

 It took 4 hours of trial & errors to figure out how to get the app to stop changing the channel when it started the Watch TV activity (the device-specific remotes were fine).
The width and angle when aiming of the IR signal from the hub is so narrow that its hard to find a place which isnt blocked by a person, chair, couch, or other object; I resorted to using a camera mount stand just to get the height and angle correct.

Once they fail, retry never works and you will have to restart the app. The problem is exacerbated by the flakey Harmony hub, which frequently has WiFi connectivity issues. I just spent 2 hours (that‚Äôs right, 2 hours) fighting this app to set up my hub after I swapped out my streaming device. I ended up having to completely hard reset the device and set everything up fresh, including all the failures and flakiness. It took me four attempts. Then because I have two of these turkeys, I wanted to rename the hub so I could distinguish it from the other one in the software.

For the most part I‚Äôve been able to put away my product remotes and only dig them out occasionally.

As a side note, I use the system almost exclusively via google assistant/home voice integration.

Also, there‚Äôs no easy way with the remote to switch between controlling devices which makes it pretty much just a replacement for one remote, and who needs another remote to add to their pile?

It would be nice to have a screen where you have all you devices side by side at the bottom of the app (like iOS normal bottom-screen menu) and controls on top. Simplify.

When I first got my Harmony a couple of years ago, I banged my head against programming the activities for a long, long time. Eventually I managed to trick the app into actually saving all of my steps and the activities worked pretty well after that. 

Recently, Apple decided it wanted to change its menu on the Apple TV. So I had to go in and update my Harmony activities to accommodate this.

In trying to add or move any step within an activity I find random other steps are deleted.
The disaster seems to be most prevalent if you have the temerity to try to move a step around within the activity. Which pretty much becomes a requirement when other steps randomly vanish and you need to replace them. I just finished another session where, yet again, while trying to add one of three steps that was randomly deleted from the top of the sequence, I found most of the steps had vanished from the bottom of the sequence after I had dragged a new step up to the top.

I know if I redo the activity a dozen or so more times I might make everything stick, but there is no way an app in the 21st-century should have these kinds of glitches, especially from this company.

With the Harmony series, once everything is set up, a single press on your app, or companion remote starts an activity and gives you access to all the functions you need. We‚Äôve used it for years with few problems.

So why only 3 stars? This app works for the initial guided setup and for control inside the app. But the user interface for setting up or changing things later is terrible. It takes me 10 minutes of plinking around to find out to how assign things to the remote. Every time.

They need a UI specialist to go through trying to use this in a home environment over a period of time and make recommendations on changing the interface.

Here are some of the problems I have come across using the app:

1. The app is horribly designed. It looks like some kind of default Windows XP program made by a first year CS student. 

2. Integration with Alexa is unnecessarily convoluted and requires you to program all of your ‚Äòactivities‚Äô first in Harmony, then make those Alexa friendly, and anytime you add a new activity to Harmony you have to redo the whole thing. 

3. The Harmony server is slower than molasses. All your commands are on the cloud so you can use either your iPhone or iPad to control your devices. Awesome! Except their servers are constantly down or too slow to be reasonably functional. Just... why?

4. This isn‚Äôt their fault, but Sony doesn‚Äôt allow the PS4 to turn on with other remotes, because... reasons. There is a workaround though! If you have a CDC HDMI capable TV (like a Sony Bravia) you can boot your PS4 by creating an activity that turns on your TV > ‚Äúsync menu‚Äù > ‚Äúselect‚Äù.

Furthermore  to control it through Alexa I had to create an activity since it doesn‚Äôt add a device to Alexa only an activity.

2) I have an onkyo receiver that is in the database, but important features such as controlling zone 2 and 3 are not supported. And if I add it as an activity to control it by voice my AC gets shutdown.
3) Apple TV - it‚Äôs in the database but does not support many of the commands of the new type of remote such as turning it off with one button.

Logitech can go 2 ways for this.

1) The Harmony control app could be updated to use the new Siri Shortcuts in iOS 12. This would add Siri voice activation support. Check out how Phillips Hue has done this in their app. 

2) The Harmony Hub could be made fully HomeKit compatible through a firmware update. This would add both Siri voice activation support and smart home logic support via HomeKit. Imagine the possibilities if we could use Harmony activities in automated smart home rules.
