We have really enjoyed our new thermostat and this app, installed about 4 years ago. Updates have been good. We've had no connectivity problems, and setting schedules and modifying is straigh simple. It can be set to adjust to outside temps too instead of just time of day. (You can set it to reach the temps you like AT the time you like knowing Sensi will actually turn furnace on sooner and full speed if its really cold out, and closer to the schedule time if it’s only cool out.)  I LOVE being able to control our furnace from bed - turning it  up early if I wake early, or down if we want to sleep in later than usual. We have even used it from the airport to be sure we returned to a toasty house. I thought our old programable thermostat was fine, but I would never go back now as this system allows much more flexibility for saving energy while you’re sleeping or at work, while still keeping you comfortable. A solid app. We have not tried the beta location app that adjusts temp down 3 degrees if your phone leaves, and turns on as you near home... we keep a pretty predictable schedule and just overuse that if it’s an odd day.";"2017-11-04T05:25:30-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=792612452&type=Purple%20Software";"792612452";244;"en";"POSITIVE"

The app used to be simple and perfect--open it to a full screen view of your thermostat; and control changes stuck. Now, it first opens to a crippled small list view of ""all"" your thermostats--because most people have five or six right? </sarcasm> You can change temperature up or down on the dinky view, but have to press to then get the full screen version for things like on/off heat/cool or fan. I use the app a lot as a remote to change fan on/auto so now have to navigate every time to do this--so damned annoying. Also, it used to solidly accept control changes now those are super flaky and often don't stick. I just tried going up from 68 to 72 and had to try several times because it bounced back to 70 then down again to 71. Many times it doesn't stick and send to device after closing app and you have to go back.

Before this we had to replace one in less than a year and have some connectivity issues with another. But the issue I have now is two fold – where they source their weather data from us not accurate for my rural location, and currently Sensi settings are not flexible enough to allow us to change the source or add a local source (we have a lacrosse weather station) for weather temp data. This is essential for those of us with dual fuel heat pumps. We learned that Dark Sky (recently bought by Apple and claims to have the most accurate hyper local weather data lol) provides the weather data for these Sensis.  But from dusk to dawn they report my outdoor temp 8 degrees cooler than it really is, causing my heat pump to kick over to propane and unnecessarily burn fuel instead of the electric heat pump. Do that every day thru winter and the costs add up, making the dual fuel setup almost useless. We love our sensi’s but if they don’t either give us more flexibility / control to change data sources OR find a more accurate data provider, we will be going to Nest or some brand that provides the options we need.

Already I notice that my furnace isn’t running nearly as much this winter and my home is still at desired temps. The only issue I have was that when ordering my new thermostat, the Sensi was advertised as one of the few smart thermostats that “doesn’t need a c-wire” to replace older thermostats. This is a tad misleading. Although you don’t need a dedicated c-wire, your wire configuration has to be altered if you don’t have one. The installation walk-through on the app never addresses this. I installed per the app and furnace wouldn’t turn on. After an hour I luckily found a tutorial video on the app that showed how to use the “fan” wire as the c-wire. This worked, but you lose the ability to use the fan to circulate air. All in all, I love the thermostat and app, but wish the c-wire comparability would have been communicated better.

I’m not going to get in-depth with its features other than to say you can control this thermostat with your smartphone anywhere on the planet as long as your thermostat has connectivity to your home wi-if. Now with that said, in regards to connectivity issues voiced in other reviews; yes, it will occasionally lose connection to your home wi-fi. I’m not a network expert. I can’t explain why. I can understand how this immediately throws people into a tizzy. It’s been my experience however that if you just let it be it reconnects itself automatically, usually in less than a couple of minutes. Your experience may vary, again I’m not a network expert. It doesn’t happen often enough though for me to warrant immediately panning it (‘one star!!! This things garbage’). I’d say 95% of the time it opens immediately on my phone. It’s a small gripe for me and the specificity you have in setting heating and cooling schedules outweigh it. Now for the big gripe.

I have had Honeywell and Nest units before. Although the Honeywell models are highly accurate and dependable, I find the Sensi from Emerson to be the best unit I have ever used. It has a very good setup tutorial through the App. It guides you step by step from start to finish. The thermostat is very intuitive and logical in its operation, and this is most likely due to the engineering thought process that was a part of its background.
The App is refreshingly simply in its layout. What I have found over time is that technical support by phone is superb, probably one of the best among any company I have ever dealt with. They have always been able to assist me and solve my owner-induced issues. I am happy as well overtime with the fact that they have not made drastic changes to the App-this can be frustrating with other Apps as you have to relearn a system-this is not the case with the Sensi App. If someone were to ask, this is the only thermostat I would recommend.

2. Please give us access to our temperature and humidity data (all of it) so I can compare it with outside ambient conditions and see how HVAC equipment is responding.

This is a very helpful tool during service and or troubleshooting. Case in point was Service Tech arrived before scheduled appointment and I was able to engage a/c units remotely so they could hear the subject noise concerns outside.  

One on vacation would benefit from Sensi to see real-time HVAC condition within the dwelling to adjust if desired. 

I would like to offer a suggestion to incorporate humility adjustments via Sensi application. Maybe an upgraded humistat can talk with an upgraded Sensi to make these adjustments. If so, really would have liked to have been educated by salesperson of this option.

Original recent review:
We bought two of these 1.5 years ago and had high hopes. My wife is blind and uses Apple Products extensively due to Apple OS VoiceOver feature. Unfortunately that relies on app developers testing against the voiceover API, and the Sensi developers apparently paid no heed to that. There are a numbers of quirks but the show stopper is the app refuses to announce the current temp setting. Well no problem I thought I will just report it, which I did... 1.5 years ago. The response was it was “in progress”. Uh huh... still waiting. Methinks it was a smokescreen and there is no intention to address voiceover Interface. We are now looking for a different solution.";"2019-11-02T06:52:51-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=792612452&type=Purple%20Software";"792612452";148;"en";"POSITIVE"

However, getting it working with Homekit was WAY more than I'd bargained for. For some reason, homekit support requires it to be hard wired to a power line from your hvac system to work. Strangely, the other smart home systems do not require this. This caused much consternation and me eventually fiddling with rewiring my hvac system slightly to accommodate it. To be fair, I have no idea if competing products may require the same, but somehow I doubt it. Also, I bought a new Wi-Fi router and changed my network name and updating This device also proved more difficult than it should have been.

Time to Temp: Okay copying this one from Nest but shouldn’t be too hard to calculate with usage history or if you ask about home details sq/ft etc and calculate it that way. 

Fan Timer: More control over the fan. Being able to turn on for say 30 minutes or 1 hour rather than just on/off/auto would be a really nice to have. I often manually turn it on and forget to turn it off for hours. 

Usage Reports: One enhancement you could make to the graphs are to scale them for 24 hours per day and then fill in the blue for the hours actually used. That way if the AC is on from 1pm to 3pm I could clearly see that data rather than just a total summary of hours used over the 24 hour period.

Cycle Speed Control: I know you can set this to slow medium etc but I rather be able to control the degrees. For example I set to cool 72 it doesn’t need to come on at 72.1 I can allow a 2 degree swing. So wait until 74 before kicking. This allows more control, less wear and tear on the equipment and energy savings.

Setting it up was a pain as HomeKit would never see the new thermostat.  After several attempts and a hard reset on the new thermostat if finally connected.  Since then, it has worked without any issues.

CONS:

One, the app is not universal.  If you are using an iPad and want to look at the thermostat, you either have to grab your phone or rely on the scaled version of the phone app.  Not a deal breaker, because you can use Siri for most things.

Two, those of use with only a single thermostat shouldn't have to tap the small tile on the opening screen of the app to get to a full view of the device.   I understand the need for this screen for those with multiple thermostats, but it seems like there should be a way to automatically open a default one.

We reset it and had trouble reconnecting it. It finally worked after 3-4 tried and we reset it again. At this point we are close to just returning it and getting something less finicky. It would not connect to home kit, however. 

Also, it says we can add multiple phones for geofencing but after searching through the app we have not been able to find this feature. When you are using the programmed schedule you have to manually switch to geofencing, which is a bit of a pain. I wish this were automatic.

As far as I know, I can’t seem to find any owner/user manual that I could reference to try to figure it out. I have two of these Sensi thermostats. The one I have the most issues with is the one literally 10-12’ away from my modem/router that is the latest that my provider offers (Xfinity X1). Both thermostats have new batteries.

However, if you make the mistake of becoming accustomed to using the app to control the thermostat, you will be met with the app failing frequently and requiring all kinds of “re-setup” with your WiFi. Plan on spending large amounts of time removing batteries from your thermostat and generally standing in front of it re-installing it every few months. To make it worse, after doing all this you may find out their servers are down and it will not work without their cloud service which will mean you have gone through all the “re-installation” for nothing. Finally, when the app goes down, you have to be physically in front of your thermostat to fix it.

The humidity offset doesn’t work at all, but even if it did, offsetting by the max 25% wouldn’t come close to the true humidity measurement.

The schedules once set, cannot be deleted. There are simple instructions to delete schedules. The problem is the app ignores those instructions and repeatedly says an active schedule cannot be deleted. Even though the schedule function is turned off, and that schedule is not active. When selecting “delete” next to that schedule, the error message comes up again and again.

I’ve deleted the app and acknowledged that I understand all the data will be deleted, too. Then when I reload the app, all the old data and the 99% humidity setting is still there.

IE, when you add a new schedule, sometimes you need to exit the app and come back to actually see it on the schedule selection screen.

Another example: If you tap a temperature arrow a few times, pause for a few seconds, then tap a few more times, it’ll undo the second set of taps and revert back to where you were after the first set of taps... I suspect there’s an issue of it sending a signal somewhere during your pause, waiting for feedback, then updating the UI... thus it loses what you did after the pause.

Ex: The Heat thermostat setting was at 62 this morning (but the room temp said 71 -- felt colder than 71!) 
I put it to 72 to get the Heat to come on and after a second or two, it just reverted back to 62. I had to put it to 72 again for it to turn the Heat on.

After creating a new schedule, I attempt to modify the day groups such that Friday and Saturday are on their own day group and Sunday-Thursday are on their own group.  No amount of precise tapping on the tiny day of week bubbles for either day group seems to make an impact.

I can see the temperature, can turn heating/cooling on and off, can manually change the temperature - but can’t modify day groups within a schedule.

However it would be great if:

1) Auto mode can be set from the wall unit

2) Locking can be more customized, rather than all or nothing. 

For example, I’d like to lock all controls, while:

a) Allowing anyone to set target temperatures but within a limit range (which is locked)

b) Allowing anyone to set the mode to heat, cool, or auto, within the same locked limit range

This provides a fair amount of control by everyone in my household, within certain limits that only I can control.

I’d be ok with this if it actuall worked, but this thermostat and app fail more often than they work. Sometimes I try pinging the sensi cloud address and it’s down completely for hours on end, other times it appears to be up but the thermostat still doesn’t work.

What this means is the app is broken all the time, and the thermostat only works if you walk up to it and set the temp manually.

Support ignores tickets for months, then closes them saying there is no problem with their cloud service.

Avoid. Return the thermostat if you find yourself needing this terrible app.";"2019-01-02T11:21:58-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=792612452&type=Purple%20Software";"792612452";137;"en";"NEGATIVE"
