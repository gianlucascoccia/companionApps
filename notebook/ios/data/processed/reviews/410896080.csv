This was that one feature I was looking forward to ever since I made the switch to Playstation. As of right now I can edit and share captured screenshots/videos exclusively only on the console itself and nowhere else. I'd understand if editing would have to be done on the console but sharing clips from my library/profile should be an option on the app! Especially with the new PS5 coming out it'd be a great addition to the PS app to be able to seamlessly share our content/trophies etc. to any social media or be able to forward to our friends. Except there's only one option and that too on console, which is Twitter. It's really sad to see how much Playstation emphasizes on 'Sharing' to the point where there's a dedicated button on the controller for it, yet no support on the app itself. It still has the basic most features the last PS App did, but this time it was just revamped with a nice and clean look. I'm hoping that changes once the PS5 is officially released but I'd love to see a sharing/editing feature integrated within the app. I know it's 100% possible and definitely can be done. Overall, great work on the app so far. Hope I'm heard and can expect something out of it in the near future!";"2020-10-28T19:22:28-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=410896080&type=Purple%20Software";"410896080";257;"en";"POSITIVE"

But there are so many things from the older version that i believe makes it better than the newer version. Being able to customize your profiles look by changing your cover image, profile color, and more was a huge deal for me. Customizing group chats was another cool thing. You can do it in the new version, but it has to be with more than two people. In the new version you can’t do as much as the older version. profiles just look so dull to me now. When you start the app you can see what your recently played games are. When you go to your profile, you can also see what your recently games played are. I think that’s unnecessary and boring. I preferred the old layout. Being able to see your friends, who you’re following, and followers was a lot better. Same goes with seeing friends profile. I really don’t want to see just mutual friends. The what’s new page was also removed. I thought that was a great way to see what your friends are up to. what games they started playing and trophies they’re achieving. I love that you can download games to your console and make purchases though the app. It’s a lot faster than doing it on console.";"2021-01-18T21:43:45-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=410896080&type=Purple%20Software";"410896080";223;"en";"POSITIVE"

my problem is that i don’t own any wired headsets, and in order to do my voice chatting from my phone it needs that. i know, i can just go to my nearest store and get a decent wired headset but it’s a waste of money if i spend all this money on wireless gear just for it not to be compatible with playstation.

on a good note, the UI is way easier. i used to have a lot of trouble on the older version and often some features wouldn’t even work. (such as buying games) luckily this update is better. and now since we can link our consoles it’s 10x as easier for me to get games since at times of the year i’m across the country from my ps4.";"2020-11-15T13:05:51-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=410896080&type=Purple%20Software";"410896080";213;"en";"POSITIVE"

However there are some issues that I have with the PlayStation Network that apply to this app. First, you can no longer change your cover image from the app, or the website for that matter. I have no idea why they removed this feature as now it’s much more difficult to change the cover image, and it often looks worse because you’re having to take a screenshot of something rather than download the image. Second, Playstation does not allow you to delete shared media so if you post anything, it stays on your profile. This is another feature that seems so obvious to have, as sometimes you post something and later don’t want to see it. Third, when you become friends with someone, you automatically follow them and they follow you  back. But if you unfriend them they will still be following you, and you can’t make them unfollow you unless you block them. Once again, it seems only logical to have the ability to control who follows you and who doesn’t but Playstation does not allow you that. If PlayStation could give more freedom to users it would make their network much better.";"2020-12-21T13:31:55-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=410896080&type=Purple%20Software";"410896080";219;"en";"POSITIVE"

It’s extremely annoying, and I’m almost wondering if it would be easier to switch to XBOX.  I’ve been an avid ps fan since the ps1, have had every system available.  Now it seems like they don’t care about the people playing anymore, or people who stream.  Why can’t we use remote play to play from our PS4 and stream the gameplay as a secondary screen to a PC or Mac, to then use things like OBS.  Instead you have to connect your controller to the pc, yet be under the same network.  Why have the lag when you could just have the controller connected directly to the PS4 pro and stream from the computer without the lag?  What’s up with these issues?  I’ve contacted Sony support for the PS4 and have gotten the messaging system ended as soon as I ask any question.  It’s seeming extremely dishonorable what SONY has done in the past 6-7 years.  I’ve even offered to buy the M.A.G. Streams back to create a new game comparable with the PS4-ps5, with no luck, no contact information, and absolutely rude feedback from SONY.";"2020-11-03T18:20:06-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=410896080&type=Purple%20Software";"410896080";220;"en";"POSITIVE"

Or any other criteria for that matter? Do you not want people to buy games anymore? It sure seems like it.  This applies to the PS5 UI too by the way. I really don’t want to see the best selling games and have no way of changing the sorting. In fact, I find myself not browsing for new games at all anymore.  I used to buy games all the time on impulse, but now I never do because you have made it so hard to find new games and add-ons. Great job Sony! I hope you are compensating indie developers somehow since you obviously only want people to see the most popular games that everyone already has on the storefront in the app and on PS5. Like for real, maybe let people choose how they want  PSN games sorted. The way it is now is total trash and I can promise your losing money because you have made it so hard to look for new releases now. I guess you are selling so many new systems you don’t even care. Cheers! I’ll add this to the growing number of apps that are now less functional for the sake of a new slick user interface. Good designers apparently are in short supply these days in the App world.

They have the Photo Gallery right there in the bottom of the interface that lets you see your captures, photos or videos. Just like Stadia. Theirs is right at the bottom of under the games you have. I realize how much work it might take to implement this into an all new designed app, and how much space it could take up to build servers or cloud service to store all photos from the PlayStation family; but your app is behind. 5 stars once it’s added as a feature but it’s just great for now. I only use it rarely because of this lacking (important mind you) feature. Because having to upload to Twitter then save tends to degrade not only the video but wastes time when I could just open the app and save or download the video/photo. Then I’d use this religiously. But still, great job Sony/PlayStation and devs that develop all these, it’s still phenomenal.";"2021-01-24T17:46:55-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=410896080&type=Purple%20Software";"410896080";185;"en";"POSITIVE"

The UI is decent but it’s not as fluid as the original UI and has some pointless screens especially in the messages/parties/friends tabs. The overall PlayStation search a user system is broken and annoying now too. You used to be able to search a player’s gamer tag and see the 1 and only result of their name, but now searching a gamer tag often shows a list of unrelated users and friends who share key words with the name you searched and lists the one person you searched somewhere in the middle of all of that and if you’re lucky they’ll appear as the very last result. Sometimes the user won’t even appear at all and you have to go through the same process on the console to get what you want. Also I miss the feature to turn on the PlayStation from the app if both were on the same network. Overall combining all the PlayStation apps was definitely a necessary move, but in doing so we have lost key features from each of the individual apps and some very simple features are too hard to access on the new app now.";"2021-06-22T11:46:42-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=410896080&type=Purple%20Software";"410896080";216;"en";"POSITIVE"

I don’t know why the felt like this feature was unnecessary. Having a wishlist actually got me to spend MORE money. Now if there’s a game I’ve been waiting to go on sale, I just have to remember which game it was in the first place and scroll through all the deals to probably not find it anyways. It was a nice way to have a list of all the games I thought looked interesting that I might pick up someday. But nope. It’s already hard to find indie games on here so if you come across one you might pick up, you’d better write it down somewhere. Makes me think they want to make it harder to get deals so they can get people to pay full price more often.
2nd, it’s glitchy. I’ve put 3 games in my cart, but when I try to pull up the cart it’s just a blank screen. Like nothing on it. 
In conclusion, it looks nice. It’s easier to scroll through. But I don’t really think they have the consumer as the priority right now. It seems more like they care about the look and pushing the Triple A titles. I hope there are updates that make improvements because PlayStation has always been my go to.";"2020-11-13T08:20:52-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=410896080&type=Purple%20Software";"410896080";219;"en";"POSITIVE"

Hopefully when the PS5 comes out the trophy system will improve showing progression, like when u got to get 10 of something have a meter, or say the amount I collected, so u know ur progress.

The ability to post things from your phone to the What’s New section and the fact that the What’s New section is completely gone (no bueno) being able to comment and like your friends achievements or posts is what made the PS app stand out on top of any other gaming app that’s out there. Messages being intergrated into the app and the fact that you can actually buy things off the PSN are both welcomed changes, but all the accessibility that was in the original app needs to return. Profile customization, themes, I personally enjoyed the fact that close friends or family could see your actual picture with the Avatar made it so much more personal. If those changes are to occur I would not just recommend this app, but if you have a PlayStation, you NEED this app. As of now though the app is just...meh*...hope to see these changes in the future, but this is a decent start.";"2020-11-15T11:19:26-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=410896080&type=Purple%20Software";"410896080";171;"en";"POSITIVE"

I am new to PlayStation (lifelong gamer elsewhere), and I did hours (HOURS) of research on the best PS-exclusives when I got my console last year. I added all the ones that interested me to the wish list, and that wish list is how I buy games. I previously opened my app, looked at my list, and boom.

For example, the Playstation Store is now easier to navigate and find, such as most everything in the app, but I give it such a low rating because, for me, the past version of this app had two really important features that kept me using this app often. The first feature is the where it allows you to turn on and off your PlayStation while connected to the same Wi-Fi as your PlayStation. I used to always do this when I was too lazy to get up and turn it off while I was laying in bed on my phone, but now this feature is gone. Not only this, but another feature with the ability to text other players and friends is gone as well.

The big problem is that for user that doesn’t use the PlayStation app very often I often find myself signed out of the PlayStation app every update! Is insanely frustrating because I would love to be able to talk with people that are messaging me through my phone instead of having to turn on the PlayStation but I have to sign in again and again and sometimes my password doesn’t even want to work on here.
The worst part about the app is that it’s separated from the other two core features of PSN! Communities and messages are both part of separate apps where as with Discord there are no separate apps for different features. Even Xbox is better than PS in this area.

BUT, there are 2 things I REALLY want changed and I don’t know if I’m alone here, but I think they would make the experience a lot better.

 1.) On the PSN feature of the app, it is confusing to navigate. The part that is confusing is the back button. It is too hard to find and the X button kicks you out of PSN leaving you to start all over. This is annoying esp if you are shopping.
 2.) I use the PS Communities app ALOT and I like to post photos. Offline! It would be nice if I could access my photo gallery from my phone, even if it meant being hooked up to WiFi and being in the vicinity of my PS4.

I’ve been using PlayStation since I was a little girl and I always HATED typing out messages with a remote. When I found the PlayStation Messages app, I was delighted to finally be able to message all my friends with ease! I was using it for years. 
Then they updated it. They tore down the messaging app and combined everything into one app. That sounds wonderful and efficient, right? WRONG! It is VERY glitchy, hardly updates the messages on time (you have to refresh, frequently), the party invites make it hard to maneuver and constantly glitch out, and you can’t even do something as simple as check the trophies for your games without it saying an error. 
I would say the best part about this update was the layout and the party option where you don’t even have to be on your PS4 to join. I just wish this layout was for the original PS app and we could still use the old Messaging platform. 
I’ve quit messaging any of my friends and trying to be active online for this very frustrating reason. 
I hope they fix this because I just hate it with a passion.

The app design is great and all but the fact that the psn store is not built in is horrible, instead it directs you to the psn website in safari.  I would like to purchase content from the app not log in to the website and buy games or dlc, makes no sense. Also the live from playstation feature can at least send you to the twitch, and ustream apps instead of the website.

Sony’s definitely lost money from me by restricting access to the wish list - it used to be that any time there was a sale I’d quickly scan through the ~40 items in my wish list and pick up anything at a sufficient discount.

Some other cool additions would be the ability to see how long you’ve played each game. Maybe like a play log sorta thing like other consoles have had.

Why are the chats in a separate app?! They should be in this same app!

2) Trophy display (Plats): Plat trophies are no longer displayed by game titles. 

3) Trophy display (totals): Users can no longer go further into a game's trophy breakdown to view total trophies for a game (i.e. 55/47 trophies collected -> 0/1 gold, 9/9 silver, 35/36 bronze, etc.)

3) Automatic updates to information: users, on many occasions, now have to pull down on a section to initiate an update.  The previous version of the app did this automatically. 

4) Recent notifications by user: Users can no longer review all recent notifications for a user by going to their PSN profile in the app. In the previous version, all recent activities were listed at the bottom of a given profile.

It used to always suggest around 40 people I might know but all of a sudden they all disappeared and now I’m hearing there isn’t anyone I might know. My guess is it has either something to do with the GDPR regulations being rolled out or with Facebook being under fire recently over privacy concerns (I’m assuming the ”Players you might know” feature worked using Facebook’s API in some way, and it’s now blocked) and having to bend on some policies to the European Union.

It’s ridiculous a useful feature like that could go through I could best describe as a dark-deprecation in some regions and players aren’t informed it’s happening. It makes PSN and this app worse. Sony Twitter support wasn’t helpful at all and was elusive in their answers when asked about this.

It’s a wannabe discord without the function to MUTE certain groups. 

The quick message function is nice but needs a few more options or possible a custom function. I’m in a big clan, and our group messages can get to 1000 in an hr of people going off with over 10 people in the party.

Another function please for dear god add PASTE! Also make report function easier like the old PSN messages app. You can only report the person directly and not messages. I get a lot of hate mail for being better than most. Lots of things I know shouldn’t be on PSN.

So muting certain groups or even during time frames would be a HUGE upgrade.
Being able to paste links or a copy pasta.
Making it where you can make certain custom messages to quick send.
These three alone will make it the best app out there for gaming.
So without these three MAJOR flaws it’s a 3/5.

I’m not sure if this is an app or PSN issue, but I’m throwing it out there anyway because it is incredibly frustrating.

2. The messaging doesn’t allow you to copy/cut/paste. In the dialogue box, there’s no option to paste. There’s also an invisible character limit (no ranting about bad teammates, then, I guess), so when I cut part of the message to not have to re-type & paste in a separate message, the app didn’t let me paste!

Please make it easier for the entire PS community and get rid of the extra apps and throw it all into the main PS app.";"2019-06-10T16:13:22-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=410896080&type=Purple%20Software";"410896080";112;"en";"POSITIVE"
