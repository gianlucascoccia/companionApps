See, it works when I first put it in, up until I close the app, and it picks up here and there. So I know it’s not due to the normal response I get (everything updated, SD card good/new, turn it off and back on < my fav). There’s a cpl conclusions I came to - 1) the app isn’t properly designed and/or updated 2) it’s a greedy way of getting us frustrated so we just buy their cloud - add the fact that the “program” that HAS to be used to see what was recorded isn’t even clickable, much less downloadable, so unusable!

I haven’t been able to edit my Recording Schedule or Alerts for several versions now. The recording schedule I did have is probably messed up as my camera now just records constantly until the SD card is full and then it stops. It doesn’t overwrite the old videos, just doesn’t record anymore. I haven’t gotten an alert/notifications for motion or a snapshot from a detected motion event saved to the SD card in months. And now I can’t even get to the settings to see what the problem is. (I also tried to access the settings on the website’s browser “Live Feed”, but it just will not load on a mobile browser and the website is outright blocked on my work computer.)

Most of these issues with the app should have been caught and solved with testing before app deployment.

What’s happening now: 
1. The time somehow registers incorrectly on videos and stills despite being set correctly in settings. Naturally this is bad for many reasons.
2. I used to get four notifications for every tiny little shift of a sunbeam. They supposedly fixed that and indeed it was better. For a month. In this place, the camera is in a spot where the light barely changes and yet it still takes dozens of pictures of nothing. 
3. The pictures and video thumbnails don't match what the pics and videos actually are but are of much older stills/videos.
4. The videos are not even a second long and show nothing even when I’m the one that set it off by coming home.
5. I just got home and checked the feed of while I was gone and out of 10 stills over an hour, all of them were exactly the same: they were all the same image of my hand on the side of the frame. When again, no one was home and it caught no other “movement.” (It feels very Adams Family...)
6. I get ZERO notifications now. Seriously, no notifications for anything although my settings are the same. 
7. The settings say it’s set to continuous recording (although that’s not what it’s doing) but it won’t let me turn it off. This would explain why my SD card was almost full even though I haven’t used it in awhile.

So basically, unless I can find another app to interface with my cameras, I’m going to have to spend money I don’t have (read: charge) to buy new cameras from a much more highly-rated company because this is absolutely the worst app I’ve ever used. I’ve only used it this long because it was marginally useful before but now it’s not even that. The only thing it seems decent at is a live view so for like checking in on your dogs. Otherwise, don’t bother.";"2018-07-11T22:33:37-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1025437540&type=Purple%20Software";"1025437540";354;"en";"NEGATIVE"

The feature allowing video clips (includes sound) to be saved to the iPad (not to the mem. on the card)...is fantastic.   It's better than saving to the camera SD card, because in most cases, the person taking the quick clips wants them as quickly available as possible.  Having to log back in the the camera to review them later ....even if they could be transferred to the iPad...would just be an extra ( inconvenient ) step...in most cases. 

HOWEVER...Please add the ability for these locally saved video clips to be""saved to"" the iPad's camera roll.  AND when playing back the video clip, regular video playback controls would be VERY USEFUL (pause / rewind /FF, etc).  currently, you can only press play...and then must wait for the entire clip to play before (if needed) replaying it, in order to review a certain part.

Lastly, it would make a huge difference if the audio mute button could be on the bottom tool bar...maybe off to the left edge.  Currently, being embedded / overlaid in the video itself makes it almost impossible to see.  No matter what color it is...it will inevitably just blend in with the given muti-color video scene.  And if it's simply made larger...it will just be in the way.  Having it disappear while the video plays is a problem as well because, often, the user will need to mute/un-mute several times, while a clip is playing.

With still images....the current function works fine...but, to be honest, on the iPad, it's easier just to use the iPad's built-in screen-shot function...which more quickly puts the image right in the iPad Camera Roll (preferable).

Summary - the app is good...and the image quality is exceptional, but these few changes related to video clip playback would make a Huge difference

The Vimtag app has a few serious omissions from the App that is required to use the wireless security camera. For example, you can purchase a two (like I did) or even three camera bundle. However, the app does not stream more than one camera at a time. Unlike security systems that allow you to stream 4, 6, and even up to 16 channels at once, the Vimtag app can only display one at a time. That means if you want or need to look at a different angle you have to exit the stream screen, go back the camera screen, and select the camera you want. Not an efficient way to utilize multiple cameras.

You can record video to a micro SD card and the App surprisingly has several recording options, which is great. The videos are recorded in 30 min increments. So even if you set the camera to record 24/7 you end up with 48 individual files per day. Not a big deal, and it actually helps review any recorded video much faster and easier than a single file would be. However, again the app is lacking here. There are no options to fast forward or rewind the video. So if the recording you seek is 20-25 mins into a video clip (as was the case with me) you literally have to sit there and watch 20-25 mins of nothing. There’s also no option to delete video files using the app, although you can format the SD card and wipe everything off of it from the app. 

Overall the app is OK, it let’s you setup the camera pretty easily and it let’s you remotely stream (one) video. But there are just too many omissions that hold it back from getting anything more that an average rating.";"2016-03-07T14:58:57-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1025437540&type=Purple%20Software";"1025437540";327;"en";"POSITIVE"

The latest updated wiped all recordings from the SD card and now I can't even access anything because the submenus for the recordings pull up one that is all Asian language characters . . It keeps telling me to insert an SD card even though there is an existing one there that clearly has been recorded over because the capacity level. It appears that I'm not the only person suffering from this issue I see another reviewer has the same problem . Every time I try to access the SD card it reverts back to the Asian menu and get stuck and I have to hard exit the app on my iPhone. This company really needs to get their act together because every update that happens is challenging ... customer support is next to zero! I already have four of these cameras in my house but will seriously be researching other companies because this is ridiculous. 

Original review:
This has always been fairly decent camera it was somewhat easy to set up everything as a system. every time there's an update, the cameras are very buggy and it takes a couple of days to adjust. the latest update however has rendered the ability to basically control the camera via the app useless. it takes away the ability to snapshot a motion detection (scene function) and only allows video. The scene function has been taken out of the settings so you can no longer tell your camera system if you're in or out,  which basically voids the ability for you to determine when the camera is going to record. I'll be more than happy to change my review once I'm able to use my cameras for what they were purchased for.";"2019-05-05T21:12:12-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1025437540&type=Purple%20Software";"1025437540";292;"en";"POSITIVE"

You replied to change the network and just add the same networked before this new update , so no need to change the network you should replace the camera for free since this is caused of the new update there is no doubt about this since everything worried for 1 year so it has to be the update

Crashes on startup on iPhone X. Doesn't surprise me, as the developer of this app clearly does not care about keeping up with the latest software/UI developments.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

This app does the basic job of viewing and controlling the camera, but it has MAJOR flaws that makes it infuriating to use.

First, the responsiveness of the video feed will often randomly slow down to unusable levels, even when viewing the camera on the local network. The picture will be delayed up to 10-20 seconds, and slows down in frame rate, which makes controlling the camera in real time nearly impossible. The only way to fix this that I can tell is to reboot the camera.

Second, if you reboot the camera, any Vimtag client that was previously viewing the stream will NOT automatically attempt to reconnect to the camera when it reboots. The image will just freeze on those clients with not obvious indication that the connection was restarted. We use this camera as a baby monitor, and it's a huge pain to have to always go upstairs to physically restart the Vimtag app on the iPad that we use for viewing the stream. In the grand scheme of things it's not a huge deal breaker, but it's annoying enough to be absolutely infuriating when it does happen, and there should be no reason why the Vimtag app can't detect loss of connection and keep trying auto-reconnect.

Third, you can't download videos recorded by the camera to either your camera roll, or to a computer. Yes, the app claims that you can ""download"" to your iOS device, or to a computer, and both claims are technically true. But from a practical standpoint, the execution of this basic feature simply doesn't work to the expectations of any human who has used any video app in the last 20 years.

In the case of the iOS app, you can ""download"" a selected recording to your device, but this has several showstopping flaws: 

1) It takes FOREVER for a recording to download to your device. The software appears to be doing some kind of on-the-fly transcoding or conversion of the raw camera recordings when it transfers it to your device, resulting in insanely slow transfer speeds.

2) No support for running in the background: While a video is downloading to your device (which can take in excess of 10-15 minutes!), you absolutely CANNOT minimize the app, receive a phone call, close your lockscreen or tap on any notification banners/pop ups from other apps that may appear, otherwise the download silently aborts, without telling you that the resulting download was truncated. 

3) If you are lucky enough to download a video to your device in its entirety, you still cannot transfer that downloaded video to your computer, or to your iOS Camera Roll so that you can view it on another device. The video is held prisoner by this atrocious app, and you are forced to watch it ONLY on the device you downloaded it on. There is no ""Open In..."" iOS Share Sheet support, nor are the videos are downloadable via the iTunes File Sharing interface. The next to useless video playback controls in the player interface, which makes it incredibly difficult to navigate and pinpoint specific parts of the video, is the final rotting cherry on top of this dumpster fire of an app.

And if you try to download the videos from another computer via the Vimtag web interface, you will experience the same, interminably slow download speeds (even if the camera is on your local network), and there is absolutely no way to ""batch"" download multiple recordings at once. So if you plan to download and archive a day's worth of recordings, you're totally screwed, unless you sit in front of your computer, manually babysitting the download process for many, many hours.

Oh, and don't try to pull the SD card of the camera, plug it in to your computer and expect to be greeted by a mountable file system that you can use to simply drag and drop the recordings to your computer. The SD card is formatted to some kind of proprietary file system that neither my Mac or PCs can read. And to add more insult to injury, if you plug the card back into the camera, it will reformat the card and erase everything that was previously on it! It's truly insane, and seems downright malicious on the part of the developer.";"2017-11-15T08:36:35-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1025437540&type=Purple%20Software";"1025437540";749;"en";"NEGATIVE"

Update - 3/30/16 - Latest update is a bomb. Can't even connect to one of my cameras. Brings it up on the ""list"" view, but then won't connect when I select that camera.  Will post another update in a few days in case it is a network issue. Additionally, it is very unresponsive so I end up panning back and forth, over correcting because it doesn't respond. And watching the network speed - it cycles from nothing to decent to nothing. What is that about? Something in between the last two updates made it go from better to much worse. :-(";"2016-05-31T10:10:03-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1025437540&type=Purple%20Software";"1025437540";127;"en";"NEGATIVE"

I went to the Vimtag website and filled out a tech support form. Tech support called me. I was told that they are making many more changes to the app so (my words here) there will be some more kinks in the road before they get the final product/results that they are looking for but they are making great progress. 

I don't understand 100% the new format. If anyone does please post a review here. It will be helpful to everyone. 

The video quality is very good. 
I still miss my still snap shots. 
I don't like having to play all of the video clips so I can save a still but... 

I do like the new calendar. You just click on it and all of the videos from that dad are listed. 

It is very strange to me that the 24 hours period goes form noon - noon instead of the normal midnight-midnight. Hopefully that will be addressed soon. 

The tech person told me there is a new devise that can be purchased on Amazon that will hold put to 2 months worth of video recording. That way one does not have to rely on the card in the camera. For now I am not going to purchase it but it sounds really good. Up to 6 cameras I believe. 

The app is finally getting better. 
Today there were some hiccups though with the thumbnails of the recordings. The still had nothing to do with the video clip. The still actually was from other days all together. 

On the other hand, knock on wood, I don't see the great number of black stills & thumbnails that happened far too often with the previous version. 

I have not tried working with this upgrade using my computer so I can't share my experience. My experience is with my cell phone and tablet. (Both iOS)

Here is my original review that I gave 1 star for.
--------------------
I upgraded one of my 3 cameras. Thank goodness I only upgraded one. I can no longer locate the snapshots! 

When I click on what used to take me to the recorded still and video snap shot recording list something totally different appears. Y
There are 2 icons located at the top right on the screen. One is a calendar. The other I have no clue but it kind of looks like a strange funnel. 

Clicking on the 'funnel' icon brings up a new screen. There are 2 headings listed. The first is 'category'. Next to it you can select 'EVENT' or 'ALL'. 
The 2nd heading is 'Duration'.
Clicking on 'all' brings up 3 choices under 'Duration' : 1 hour, 30 min, 5 min. 
Clicking on 'Event' the choices are: 1 hour, 30 min, 5 min, Shortest. 

I don't understand what all of this is or how it works. I will be calling tech support when the open this morning! 

I am very upset and suggest, especially if you only have 1 cam to wait before upgrading!

This is horrible for me.";"2016-04-20T14:55:44-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1025437540&type=Purple%20Software";"1025437540";518;"en";"POSITIVE"
