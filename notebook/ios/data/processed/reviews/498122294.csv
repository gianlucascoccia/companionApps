Problem is when I check events it only records a few seconds at a time and does not get the things I need like a break in or my dog breaking out of her kennel and destroying everything in the house from her anxiety when alone. Conversations or theft. It will record light changing as the day goes on or if my cat comes in the room. But only in seconds not minutes. It also does not record in color as stated and does not get close up to faces. I have them located in every room and upsets me that the audio really doesn’t work much either. 
Sometimes it is not available and I have to reset it when I get home. But when at work I cannot see what’s going on if it decides it doesn’t allow me to click on that camera. 
I like it when it works but wish it was in color most of the time. Please fix these problems or I will have to upgrade to new cameras.";"2018-09-19T06:18:46-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=498122294&type=Purple%20Software";"498122294";196;"en";"POSITIVE"

This camera constantly loses Internet connection. To reset it to your phone has to be in the house. So when you are away, and need the camera, when it loses connection, you cannot fix it until you are home. Defeats the purpose! The communication on this camera has a very heavy delay. If you were trying to talk to somebody that is home, the delay is approximately five seconds. Meaning, the people at home (most likely children) need to wait five seconds before they answer you. No child, even a teenager, remembers to do this. It is extremely frustrating on both ends. I would definitely look into another camera.";"2018-08-06T04:32:07-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=498122294&type=Purple%20Software";"498122294";117;"en";"NEGATIVE"

The camera itself is pretty good and I like that I can see at night too. My problem is the recording; I guess since it’s free service you can’t complain but it’s so sporadic that it doesn’t always capture what you think it will. It is catching the changes in light and some sounds, like when my heater comes on because it’s blowing over the camera. But yet when my dog got a hold of my shoe it totally skipped recording that. Very disappointing, but my dog appreciated that. So even when it records, it’s in few second sections so the whole time my dog was spewing trash around the house, I only got the last of it as evidence.
Lately it is not letting me log in right away I have to close the app and open it again sometimes a couple times before it logs me in.";"2018-02-28T14:24:29-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=498122294&type=Purple%20Software";"498122294";166;"en";"POSITIVE"

Only problem is only random events are filmed and only for a few seconds. It will record leaves blowing in the wind all day long and miss somebody walking up to the house. I have tried the motion sensitivity on every possible level every kind of light and there is no rhyme or reason to what it chooses to record.  I literally have tried three cameras filming the same spot to try to piece together a single event like ‘what time did the mail arrive?’ and still fail to film the mailman. I cannot express how much I hate this app. I like the cameras but they are paperweights if I have to use this app. I know the app is free but my cameras were not.

Then, a second firmware update which disabled them. I used a workaround.

Then, a new app, my fault, I had auto update on, made all cams useless. Made password change impossible. Cameras will not reset.

Can not obtain a new pass word. Unsure of user name, requests do same, no results.

Username and pass sent to another address.

The change from iSecurity+ back to a redirect to Belkin has been a disaster.

Bear in mind, do not use these camera's in the house. All activities are monitored. Including your children and wife.

Do not aim them at license plates.

The email update intrusion was a failure from the beginning and never addressed.

The rear yard cam will activate an intrusion alert, on the street at the cams lowest setting.

This was reported, nothing done, making the 10$ to ?, a month service, a total waste.

Your iPad will capture stills and video stored on your iPad locally.

Do not use share, nor ever ask to have someone else share their camera feed with you.

Make sure your account at Belkin shows no camera image at all on all camera's.

It you have security problems, do not use a wireless system. Hard wire cams with a monitor, absolutely no internet access.";"2016-10-20T12:10:33-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=498122294&type=Purple%20Software";"498122294";231;"en";"NEGATIVE"
