The functionality of the Powerview app is unbelievably practical. I can close the shades to block out the UV rays of the afternoon sun, open them later and totally close the shades for the evening-all automatically. I don‚Äôt have to even think about it. Save a lot of $$ on air conditioning bill too! In addition, it gives the house an ‚ÄúI‚Äôm at home ‚Äú look when we are away for a few days.

I‚Äôm an app developer, and I‚Äôve been impressed with everything Hunter-Douglas got right: the UI is especially intuitive, and for the most part, the app and especially the shades have been rock-solid reliable. 

However ‚Äî there‚Äôs a continuing issue with the app occasionally not setting the scene data in the hub correctly. It appears as if the scene data can somehow get corrupted between creating/modifying a scene, and then transmitting that scene data to be stored in the hub. 

This issue was verified when Hunter-Douglas‚Äô superb support technician guided me to slightly change the scene data, causing it to be written out to the hub again. That solved my problem. 

As an app developer it appears to be an initialization or corruption issue, which could be tracked down by embedding more data validation into the app. I might suggest the data be checksummed and the checksum be stored both in the app and on the hub. That way, any degradation of data could be automatically detected and perhaps the issue could be found and corrected. 

All that said, the above issue is mostly a temporary frustration: the product has been a pleasure to work with, and now that HomeKit is supported, I can ask Siri to invoke any scene.";"2019-06-10T16:56:43-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1009384826&type=Purple%20Software";"1009384826";228;"en";"POSITIVE"

My PowerView network consists of a hub and a repeater. The skylight, which is closest to the hub works without any issues. The two honeycomb shades which are within a few feet from the repeater work about 20% of the time. The pebble remotes work consistently so it is an issue with the PowerView app or network.

Overall Installation wasn‚Äôt too great as my installer did not set up the PowerView app and I had parts installed correctly that I had to fix (I had blackout channels on the side that were not fully affixed and the flashing/molding that is used to help stop light leakage along the sides is not installed correctly).

I have spoke with Hunter Douglas twice now trying to fix the inconsistent behavior of the app/shades and nothing has worked. I have moved the location of the hub/repeater and performed a hard reset on the repeater and shades to try and fix my issues.

On paper, it sounds great. In use, the system isn't reliable. We added motorization to nine of the 19 window coverings. Half of the powered shades work reliably. The other half seem to have minds of their own. Sometimes they respond to the app. Sometimes they don't. It appears that some shades don't wake up from standby mode like they should.

Using the pebble remote will often (but not always) wake up a non-responsive shade and enable it to be controlled by the PowerView app. I've tried rebooting the hub and deleting shade memory but the results are hit and miss. I ended up deleting a couple shades to start over but they're still not reliable even after reprogramming. All PowerView-enabled shades are in the same room together with the hub. I added a repeater device but this doesn't help either.

The app shows signal strength and battery level for each shade. The obstinate shades sometimes show a green status, presumably indicating all is good, but at other times the battery level and signal strength icons are grayed out. Batteries are brand new in all shades--they were just installed.

Nest integration would be great if it worked reliably. When Nest determines no one is home, most of the shades move into the appropriate position, but there's always one or two that don't cooperate.

Similarly, because PowerView communications are unreliable with half the shades, the automation routines just cause eye-rolls when shades refuse to cooperate. Some stay open when they're supposed to close. Some stay closed when they're supposed to open. Hub reboots don't fix the problem, nor does deleting shade memory or removing shades completely. As mentioned earlier, using the pebble remote often jump starts the communication between the hub and shade and re-enables app control.

With all the shades assigned in the app to specific rooms, I began to build the room scenes and scheduling.   I found the app menus to be clear and easy-to-use.   The ability to customize the scenes with your own labels and colors adds a fun touch although for future versions I hope they offer a broader selection of scene icons.

Ive now got 4-5 daily shade scenes programmed in each room.    They all activate on cue.  I love the way they give the rooms just the right balance of privacy and sunlight throughout the day.

It would be nice if the Hunter Douglas hub would pair directly to Alexa. But since I programmed them for everyday and different scenes it's easy to change one window if I want with the remote. But it would be nice to say Alexa open shade 1. The silhouettes were expensive but worth it since are windows are 70 x 70. Nothing else would have worked because of the weight.

I configured several scenes and schedules but the execution of these scenes are very inconsistent. For example, I have 3 window covers in 1 sunset and in 1 sunrise scene. When you activate the scenes via the app sometimes nothing happens, or some but not all blinds close or open. The same happens with the schedules. Coming home at night I expect all blinds to be closed but most of the times some are still open. In the morning not all of them open. Triggering the same schedule or scene again will complete the remaining actions. Removing and creating new scenes and schedules doesn't change a thing. It's very frustrating working with an app like this. The app also loses connection with the hub frequently while using it, even when you are only a few feet away from the hub, so it's not a strength of signal issue.

This app works great when the developer updates it, however when Apple updates their phones the developer doesn‚Äôt update the app and it stops working again. Please continually update the app!

The app ask for which hub I want to connect to every time I open it (There is only one for your house). After I select the one and only hub it's a 50/50 shot it's going to connect. The scheduling worked for a little while and then stopped. My installer told me I might have to reinstall the app every once in a while or I'll have to go in to the app when it works and reconnect the shades to the hub when they aren't working. When I pay over $7,000 for shades in my house I expect them to work 95% of the time. I understand electrics need refreshing once in a while but not ever to this extent. The software part of the system is just junk. The whole reason I went with these was to use them with the Amazon Echo. However using that you need to use it with the IFTTT app. That fine and easy to setup but takes for ever to complete the action after you say the command. I heard all kinds of excuses from, ""weak internet"" which actually made me laugh out loud at them, to ""well it's having a hard time going through you walls"".  At that point they had repeaters that didn't really help either. Save you money and just hire someone to live with you to open and close your blinds.";"2017-05-27T14:03:36-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1009384826&type=Purple%20Software";"1009384826";245;"en";"POSITIVE"

I am lucky that I am computer literate because my dealer had no expertise in setting up the blinds and after three or four hours, I finally just told him to forget about it. 

After many hours over several days and two fruitless calls to customer service (all they did was read, word for word, the awful set up brochure), I finally got the blinds to somewhat do what I wanted. In fairness, their online PDF help file is much more informative but still hard to navigate. 

Now six months later, they still work correctly only about 75% of the time. Often at night one or two blinds will fail to close or in the morning one or two will fail to open. Using ""scenes"" will often result in erratic results as well. Unpredictable. 

When I am away from home (I travel a lot which was one of the reasons I bought these), I have no confidence that my blinds have closed properly and indeed often they don't. 

This blind system came highly recommended and my expectations were high so when they fail to work I am left feeling screwed.";"2017-06-17T09:22:58-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1009384826&type=Purple%20Software";"1009384826";226;"en";"NEGATIVE"

Unfortunately control of the shades thru the Powerview app is intermittent. Using the scene option results in the hub losing track of the shade position in the majority of attempts to adjust the shades failing. Using the pebble instead of the app is even worse. The result is frequent resetting of the hub, scrambling to find a repeater that will talk to the shades, and trying each of our phones and iPads to regain control. Scheduled events have yet to operate. However, there is a lot of promise if they ever work out the bugs. Hopefully there will be an update to iron out the bugs.

Update 2/16/16. Tried the app upgrade. Still can't find 10 of our 11 shades. So sad.";"2016-02-16T21:51:45-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1009384826&type=Purple%20Software";"1009384826";143;"en";"NEGATIVE"
