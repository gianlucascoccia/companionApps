The main source is on the top floor. I hook up the main router on the top. I have the small two that connects on the second floor one at each end of the floor. So far it is great as long as no one messes with it at the source. I love the app because I can share the password via text. Test the speed and look at the security and it has parent control and guest which I don’t use but options are there. I love the fact I can be anywhere and I can use and look at the app to see if internet is connected I do not have to be in my home. It is very easy and simple to set up.
I had Orbi since April 2020. It was my first router. It was price range $200. It is well the investment. I was looking more for width. This is  what I needed. My brother would get cheaper brands it always gets knocked off and he buys more and it is all over the place. It was very frustrating not being able to get connected.  I hope this help. Thank you for taking the time to read my review. Best luck to you in finding what is right for you. I would recommend this . 100%";"2020-08-15T12:23:50-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1182184397&type=Purple%20Software";"1182184397";231;"en";"POSITIVE"

Yes I like Orbi RBK50 design, it does fit into our space nicely. Counting all the Ethernet ports Netgear gave us (7) not including port for modem which makes eight. It really does makes a difference hardwiring smart TV’s, Apple TV and other devices through Ethernet ports like PlayStation. I have notice zero refreshing while streaming cable television or watching Apple TV. All cable providers stations look visually good and thinking about it my 5.1 surround sound sound fantastic. I have 22 devices connected including security cameras etc. I haven’t experienced one single hiccup. 

App:
It’s basic but very functional for what’s immediately important. I do question quality of Speedtest just because sometimes it gives ridicules low results compared to browser Speedtests which put Orbi off the map and beyond the stars fast. Maybe update for app will fix issue. I don’t mind having a second app called Circle to manage family members because it keeps apps much cleaner and less junky. What I don’t like is paying monthly subscription and since I don’t use Circle anyways it really doesn’t matter but I do get occasional notifications which is annoying from apps. Security: Running Bitcoin Core drives security features nuts and yet too redundant. I think to open ports and assign static addresses Orbi needs access through a browser. I haven’t needed to do this.";"2020-06-06T20:33:11-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1182184397&type=Purple%20Software";"1182184397";235;"en";"POSITIVE"

It didn’t recognize the satellite when it was 10 feet away. This app provides nothing but endless waiting. Search for the satellite? How about watching a spinning circle for 3 minutes? Now do that 20 times and you will start to get the idea. For some operations there is a progress bar, but for most it is just a spinner and a message to wait for several minutes. After a reset the router forgot all admin passwords (including the default!) and was inaccessible. Finally after some combination of resets and new setups and power cycles, it finally found the satellite. Ultimately I started the install around 5pm, and everything was up and running by 9pm. The router has been working well for 8 days, but the app is broken. The device list is populated, but the app says none of them are connected to the network. The network map shows both routers, but no connected devices for either of them. The web interface for the router works as expected and shows all connected devices properly. So it is clearly an issue with the app parsing the data provided by the router. Finally, the app forces you into creating an account, and demands personal information. It automatically signs you up for trials of some virus protection BS, filling my inbox with spam from a company that I never interacted with. Welcome to a world with ads ON your router.

I get pings when one of us unwittingly opens a website that may be malicious. It is nice to get advanced warnings from invisible cyber threats. It is hard to know otherwise. I can perform updates without going to a website and so far all updates have been minimally intrusive. My only complaint is the Armor, Netgear, Bitdefender rabbit hole you wind up in once you pay for a device. There is no way to define/understand these individual, free standing products when they get bundled into a subscription. And good luck getting support when you get a message that your device isn’t protected when you thought it was. This can be troublesome. It gets worse when it is about to expires. Then you get emails telling you to renew...I shut off auto-renewal in all my accounts so I can be a good consumer at the end of a contract. I won’t spend money to renew if a product drops in productivity. However, in the case of Orbi, I have little concerns.

I’ve been hearing such great things about mesh type WiFi routers.  Setup was easy and comes in two flavors; the Orbi app or a web browser.  I chose the Orbi app and it was easy.  Our WiFi was up and running within 20 minutes.  Every item we have connected easily to the router and speeds seemed great (no specific speed tests were run, just watched Netflix on each device).  I have a 14 year old and needed to setup some limits.  I had time limits for each day on my old router where it would allow a connection to the internet between 7am and 10pm on his devices.  I also have a few websites blocked through my old router.  I could not do this on the Orbi.  You had to use Open DNS (separate website) along with the Orbi’s parental controls menu to setup websites or servers.  You could not, however, setup times for internet access to devices.  This is unacceptable to me.  The Orbi has Circle Disney setup on it, which gives you more parental controls at a cost of $5/month?!?!  That is also a separate login. Both Circle and what little parental controls within the Orbi router was just too complicated and lacking for me to keep the device, so we returned it and reconnected our old WiFi router.  We now will be looking for another router manufacturer for our home.";"2018-04-15T16:14:41-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1182184397&type=Purple%20Software";"1182184397";243;"en";"POSITIVE"

I switched from a normal tri-band router to this 2 satellite orbi (three piece unit) because I was unable to stream two roku sticks at one time. I have a three story home with one orbi unit on each floor. Not only are my streaming devices spit fire fast, but I’ve got noticeably faster upload and download speeds to my Xbox one console, my computer, work laptop, the families laptops, our tablets and cell phones. 

The app is easy to use and understand allowing me to password protect the router, check on the net time and traffic, and even check my speeds and diagnose connectivity with the tap of a block. If my net is down because of the fiber optic work the phone company is doing, my 4g/lte still allows me to connect to the unit! 

All in all it’s a very... VERY... powerful unit for what I believe is an affordable price. I feel like I spend less time working on the families computers and more time enjoying them and our streaming services. If you’re a multi level home or a multi player household, or even if you just have lots of friends, family, or company in your home, orbi is a must have in my book.";"2018-11-27T07:09:27-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1182184397&type=Purple%20Software";"1182184397";217;"en";"POSITIVE"

Initially when I bought it I expected to have good internet coverage throughout my home. So far, the orbi has exceeded my expectations in that regard. Not only do I have good coverage in my home, but also just about everywhere else on the property. The interior walls of my home are constructed of 4 inch concrete blocks and the exterior walls are constructed of 8 inch concrete blocks with rebar. All devices on the wireless network experience the same network speed everywhere on the property. There doesn’t appear to be any dead spots. This is especially useful for my wireless Reolink home security cameras which I have located on different corners of my home. I can also see all of the devices connected to my network through netgear’s mobile app and I can allow or deny access to any of these devices. Disney’s circle app which can be used with this device is a good free app for enabling different levels of restrictions for devices on the network.

But the problem is, when a device is connected to the WiFi, which ever Hub or Satellite was closest on first connecting... that’s where it forever stays. Simply put, no matter where I go in the house, say with my phone, if I’m closer and better connected to a different satellite, the system doesn’t automatically switch my connection to the best connection. It keeps me at the first, which may be bad at the other side of the house. This is retarded and defeats the purpose of adding more satellites... other than to just extend that initial link, which is fine for a static device, but seriously, mobile devices need to be able to get the best connections always. I should also be able to manage at least manually how a device is connected with whichever base or Satellite I want. Give me the control if the system itself fails to optimize the connections automatically. This to me is a huge oversight and failure of the company and product.

Once you’re in there’s not much to the app other than monitoring the speed and connection.

My one critique is their insistence on downloading a separate app called “circle” to utilize most of its unique features.  If you want to pause internet, set up parental controls, and manage specific devices, you must download Circle.  First of all why cant all of this integrate with the Orbi app?  And second, upon downloading Circle (and setting up yet another account), you must pay a monthly subscription if you want to use it.  (Yes there’s a free account option but it’s extremely limited - not worth it).  Call me old fashioned I assumed all this would be included with a very expensive router but I guess not.  It’s not the end of the world, but the circle thing felt like a bait and switch.

But Netgear has got to figure out why it’s iOS setup process is so terrible. I have as simple a setup as one could: pulled the router and satellite out of the box, plugged them in, but it took half a dozen tries for them even to recognize each other. And worst of all, every time the devices refused to cooperate, the app just sat there with no help, no advice. Netgear is clearly a hardware company, not a software company. I hope they’ll do some serious, advanced testing of their app—especially the new user onboarding process—so others won’t find themselves stuck in a seemingly endless loop of failure and rebooting as I was for nearly an hour.

Finally, their decision not to devote the meager resources to enabling landscape mode in the iPad version of their setup app is a slap in the face to users.

I did that and now have a strong signal at the pool equipment but still the iQ20 will not connect. After talking to Zodiac tech support they said that iAqualink will not work because the Orbi band steers between 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz and that the Orbi needs to be set to static 2.4Ghz. There is no easy way to change to static 2.4. I ended up setting up two separate SSID’s: one for each band. Now the iQ20 will connect about 10 percent of the time.

The main issue is that the status that displays in the app, is sometimes inaccurate, and is usually different than what displays on the web portal.
Overall, I am VERY dissatisfied with both the hardware and the software, because I’ve only had this kit for 18 months and the satellite RBS50, is inoperable after 1.5 years of use.  Netgear support admitted that the satellite is now useless and refused to address it, because I didn’t purchase the extra coverage and I am past 1 year.  They did not want to discuss it with me, and longer, so they lied and said they would escalate it and email me within 48 hours.  The only thing this accomplished was getting me off the phone.  It is true that the customer service rep was cordial, but I really don’t appreciate being lied to, not to mention wasting money on something that should last more than a year and a half. Now, the WiFi signal on the router (RBR50) goes out about once a day.  I guess Netgear expects consumers to replace technology about once every 2 years or so…Keeps them in business, I guess.

No other device, even if it's properly logged in and can manage all other aspects of the router (devices, network maps, wifi settings, etc) can manage the Armor settings. It stubbornly refuses to allow access to the Netgear Armor settings with an ""Error: Unknown Error"". I talked to Support about it and they were unable to meaningfully assist.

75% of the settings that you would expect to be able to change you cannot, either through the app or through the web interface.

Some settings you cannot even access through the web interface and have to be performed through the app.

The netgear armor system is a nightmare, whatever you do do not under any circumstances turn it on, otherwise you lose access to a lot of sites including Apple Updates and a lot of first-tier sites which the system just arbitrarily blocks for no reason, on top of that, if it will give you the option to open a ticket to have it checked then you have to submit a ticket to bitdefender and wait 72 hours for them to add the site to the allowed list.

I cannot be the only person in the world and looking at the netgear forums I am definitely not the only person in the world that has asked for the iOS updates to be unblocked, yet every time an Apple device in my house needs updates I have to put in a ticket to have it unblocked.

I’ve tried turning off the bitdefender armor system and it makes no difference.

1st the Orbi is both amazing and infuriating. When it works it’s the best home router hands down, but it tends to be unreliable and plagued by half baked firmware updates. Now they just updated the app.  The first thing it asks for is a Netgear account. Not the router login. So now I can’t manage my Orbi without having a Netgear account. It’s so frustrating. I just want to go into the app and turn off my kids iPads. Why can’t I do that without a Netgear account?  I could one version ago. Everything piles up. Eventually the Orbi is going on eBay.

This is a follow up to Netgear’s canned response as to why it’s good to require the Netgear ID for app access.

You’ve got to be kidding me. Your own post from the community page advises against using remote access to protect against the VPNFilter Malware.  This right here is emblematic if the whole Netgear experience. Oh and BTW on the Genie app you’re off on the device type so when I set a device type on the Orbi, it is miss identified in the Genie app. Again an example of what to expect from the Netgear experience, just slightly off.";"2018-07-24T20:52:24-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1182184397&type=Purple%20Software";"1182184397";239;"en";"POSITIVE"

The installation was a breeze and it included the base and a satellite. I’ve connected few wired devices and the remaining 18+ where all wireless.

Very quickly I’ve experienced fluctuations in  speeds. Over the time few firmware updates seemed to stabilize speed issues. However, one thing that has been happening is the abrupt internet connection drops.

The device shows strong WiFi signal yet it struggles to load google page, eventually timing out with no internet connection message. What’s interesting is that the connection comes back right after it and everything loads just fine.

To isolate my internet provider issues, I was able to confirm overall internet connectivity trough cable modem during Orbi connection drop.

This issue has been now hunting me for over a year. I’m very disappointed and surprised that such premium retail product is in the market and not being addressed by netgear. Btw, the connection issue is one of the most user reported problem and can be found on Reddit and google search.

The big problem with the app is that it doesn’t allow your device to see the network. We are on Apple devices and when we would use the app we frequently got the message that we were not connected to our Wi-Fi network. So therefore, we could not use the app to do maintenance on the router. The only thing that seemed to work was deleting the app and logging in over the Internet.

It’s been disappointing. The forums are full of people trying to figure out which version of the firmware is stable, and whether some promised feature (like the Ethernet backhaul) works reliably or not.

The software feels wobbly. The app is relatively slow to connect to the router and report on its condition. The router itself needs to go through a slow reboot for configuration. When you reboot the router, you need to physically unplug the satellite unit and wait minutes to plug it in again, in order to be sure changes are propagating to the satellite. 

When you run the app, it tries to get you to sign up and pay regularly for a Disney content protection service.

Also, this latest version of the iOS app seems to require you to create and login with a Netgear account, in order to do anything. This is rather ironic, considering that one selling point of this system is that it was supposed not to require any interaction with cloud services to operate.

This is a very frustrating issue that could be resolved by moving to a combined WAP2/WAP3 security setting, but that is apparently harder than it seems. It gets resolved when issuing only WAP3, but many devises around the house won’t work with that setting, so that’s not a solution. 

Also, the app is disturbingly limited. You can only pause a devise on the network (essentially turn it on or off). You can neither schedule a devise nor the wifi to turn off/pause at set times. I have teenagers and this feature, which is available in other systems, would be very useful.

When placing the satellites, I used a third party speed test app to find the best location within our house. It would be nice if the Orbi app did that. 2) the app makes it hard to identify the devices connected to the WiFi.

Focus on core functionality. Perhaps directing a device from main router to satellite in the app. I’m 4 feet from the satellite and yet mine fails to the router 60 feet away.

Improve ability to mask 5g for certain, selected devices. Cameras, etc.

Improve service accessibility from community to direct help when needed. Very poor marks here! Too much trying to upsell. When someone pays nearly a $1000 for product u need to step up ur service. Until you do your product and service are Nd will be low!

The Netgear website give me the WRONG troubleshooting & password recovery info for the model router I have (The Whole Home Mesh WiFi AC3000 / RBK50). The app worked well with the hardware for the first few months, then after a software update the app stopped working.
It seems the only fix is to reset everything to factory settings and set up the network over again from scratch, which is time consuming....Then I guess I’d have to do that again every time Netgear updates it’s app.

So I do not have the benefit of the Netgear App, which helps to maintain and police the network.

The speed test in the Orbi app is nice until you recognize that it is only a test of the modem and router and doesn’t give you the speed delivered to your device over WiFi.   What bandwidth my device actually has is what matters the most to me.  

Since my new mesh network is not delivering consistent bandwidth, so diagnostics would be helpful.

Example:  Google won’t reliably load in Chrome on my trusted Mac, but the Orbi app says I have 70mds of download and >10mb of upload speed. 

The app and the device instruction do not included provisions for custom setups like static IP addresses and security types. 

 Orbi requires a Netgear account be setup before the app works.  I don’t see the value in this but I do see potential security vulnerabilities when I expose potential access control of my router to Netgear (or any outside party).

— original review —-

Netgear’s Orbi RBR50 + Satellite work well once set up properly.  I found the initial setup to be clunky with repeated resets and restarts.  My ISP did not set up properly, had to use another router to get the initial DHCP synch with my ISP to work.  Re-syncing the Satellite with the head unit is manual, not automatic, and requires running around the house to reset each unit by hand.  The app is out of date, not iPad-ready (doesn’t rotate, needs to be re-initialized for correct device lists, for example). 

This is an example of a high performance product with poor fit and finish.  I’m not recommending it to non-techies.

The app refuses to acknowledge the fact that I have a satellite in my setup. The web interface sees it properly, and everything works correctly, so it’s definitely a bug in the app. I have re-run the entire setup from scratch to prove that it wasn’t a fluke.

This app also allows you to configure essentially nothing of any importance. The only thing you can really do is configure security methods / keys for your primary & guest SSIDs, view a device list, update firmware (only as of very recently), and reboot the router. *That’s it*. I end up using the web interface every time I need to view or configure something, since this app does only a tiny fraction of what the system is capable of adjusting.

There’s also no iPad compatible version (it’s portrait only, low res).

3- It forgets past speed test results. 
4- the traffic meter is so badly designed and so completely inservible that I’ll be submitting it to a site that collects horribly designed charts. This chat will win the prize to the worst example.

Even when it was running this app and the Orbi are missing some essential features. For example,  I can’t see network activity in real time to know what the data hogs are. I can see aggregate summaries of activity, but that’s pretty useless when trying to manage discrete users and devices. 

The “map” if the network is literally three nodes in line: internet-Orbi-Orbi. Really? What good is that as a map? What does that tell me other than Orbi is on the internet and has two units connected. What about seeing which devices are connected to each Orbi? That would help debug access and signal strength issues.

With your new router, you get a free trial of their network security software. But as it gets close to expiring, it starts sending you nagging notifications to buy a subscription, multiple times a day. You can’t just tell it to stop nagging.

Parental controls and monitoring specific devices are hard to use.

Had I realized the app required logging into an account every time, I would have looked for a different product.";"2021-05-08T08:06:57-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1182184397&type=Purple%20Software";"1182184397";145;"en";"NEGATIVE"

I cannot see what is connected to each Orbi. It fails the speed test every time. I have contacted support and was told to uninstall, check for updates and firmware. Nothing helps. The Orbi units themselves work great, no issues there at all. But this app is worthless.  When you spend hundreds of dollars on a premium unit you would assume both the app and tech support would back it up!  And I was wrong!!!!!";"2020-12-03T02:59:11-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1182184397&type=Purple%20Software";"1182184397";86;"en";"NEGATIVE"

The app will very often not find my router even if i’m on the WiFi network and so I have to press the “Anywhere Access” button. Speed tests in the app will very often crash. And the section for “traffic meter” is ineligible and impossible to read because it’s so small to read the numbers. Very few options in the app compared to cheaper routers like Google’s nest WiFi. The hardware is superb but software/app is really lacking in features and buggy.";"2020-09-22T19:01:11-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1182184397&type=Purple%20Software";"1182184397";92;"en";"NEUTRAL"
