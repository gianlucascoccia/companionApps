I did not give this five stars because I cannot seem to figure out how to get the proximity sensor to work. I tap proximity and it tells me that to change proximity settings I must go into the app again and it logs me out. I think the proximity is set and detected, but the lights fail to turn off when I get out of blue tooth range and of course do not have to turn on either if I had them off first. In other words?  Proximity detection is a no go. 

Also, I would like to be able to change the speed of the preset lighting color cycles, which currently cannot be done. Maybe a future update?  Also, custom color cycles would be a nice feature. And the alarm feature, while basic does not allow for a gradual on or off.l gradient. It just turns the light on or off at a specific time and need to be changed every time you log in to the app. Would like to be able to set my lights to turn on or off for different weekdays or even multiple times in a given day. 

Quality of lighting seems good though. 

Biggest complaint is proximity detection not working.";"2015-04-26T18:08:11-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=810201950&type=Purple%20Software";"810201950";230;"en";"POSITIVE"

There is a proximity option which I assumed meant that when you get near the light with your phone in your hand, it will turn on. This is never the case and never works. There's also timers for turning off and turning on, but they are very confusing to understand and also do not work. 

Such an easy function and I can't figure out how these things work. Also the app always loses connection. You have to turn off the light manually and then re-open your app to get a connection. Once the app is connected it's fun playing with the colors and getting an ambient light that you like. But all these other functions need to work too. Especially the timers. I would like the lights to go off and on at certain time. Why can't it be time coded properly? 

Please fix this app.";"2015-11-09T03:46:55-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=810201950&type=Purple%20Software";"810201950";174;"en";"POSITIVE"
