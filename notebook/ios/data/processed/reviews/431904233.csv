Scrolling thru the menus showed it had WiFi capability. Cool I thought! I was at first disappointed to find out it only works with a Nexia hub or app, which I had never heard of before. So I installed the app on my iPhone and created an account. Then it came time to get the app and the thermostat to talk to each other. The good news it’s the app takes you step by step thru the process. For security reasons I recommend configuring your router to have a guest WiFi separate (lan access blocked) from your main WiFi and tell the thermostat (via the app) to use the guest WiFi. Once everything is configured, the app talks to the “cloud” and then the “cloud” talks to the thermostat and the thermostat reports back what it’s doing. The thermostat can be fully controlled from anywhere there is an internet connection.

However, I have not been able to get Alexa to work with the Nexia app. The Alexa skill for Nexia is enabled but Alexa says it can’t find the thermostat.";"2021-09-16T20:41:54-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=431904233&type=Purple%20Software";"431904233";192;"en";"POSITIVE"

This would be the ability to manually adjust the temperature different from the schedule running but with a system end time versus running at that temp until the next schedule period which could be hours later. An example for you would be doing vigorous housecleaning that causes a person to get hot such as mopping, dusting and vacuuming where I would previously set the temp for cooler for about an hour duration and then it would automatically revert back to the scheduled temperature at the end of that hour. I have to remember to go back and set back to Run Schedule when done or realize I didn’t when I get too cold when the work is done.

As an HVAC dealer I have to say that I love what we can do with this system. I mean how many others can allow the homeowner to give the dealer/technician ability to check everything about the thermostat remotely? Not only can you allow us to control your thermostat temporarily, but we can always check system run stats and make sure your system is working correctly!

It does also operate as a hub to run other compatible things such as a camera. 
What’s not: The Nexia thermostat touchscreen is terrible. Most of the time it does not work and you can only make changes using a mobile device or computer. Their is no way to do a temporary hold for a set time such as when you have a party with lots of people the way Honeywell units work. You can only set it on permanent hold and then you must remember to change it back. It takes forever to reboot the thermostat. The hub operation has very limited functionality.
Summary:  Delete the hub. I would much rather have better HVAC operating options, since anyone wanting a hub would purchase a more sophisticated model such as Samsung’s SmartThings to run household equipment. The thermostat application is poor system design with mediocre capability. I will probably change it out to Honeywell.";"2021-01-24T14:13:21-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=431904233&type=Purple%20Software";"431904233";187;"en";"POSITIVE"

I’m only using this as a thermostat control, so that’s the extent of this review. In short: it’s a train wreck. Run away. Longer: the interface is ugly. It might update after a while...or it might not. The scheduling conventions were clearly designed by an engineer with little to no UI experience.

I think that’s the only way to get the app working up to the level of what you paid for your “smart device”.

As some others have mentioned, this is not nearly as functional as the app for a Nest or EcoBee.  Those dedicated apps are focused on a single product, whereas the Nexia app is scattershot across a diverse line of products.  The only commonality between the products is the technology employed to allow it to communicate.  Therefore the app lacks focus and control for an advanced item, such as a Trane thermostat.

On the positive side, it does the very basics - change temperature, set schedules, etc.  But for what we paid for the thermostat (or insert your Z-Wave device here), I would expect the app to closely match the presentation and functionality of the thermostat.  Go to your Account on Nexia’s website, and you will see a nice colorful display that resembles what you see on the thermostat.  It doesn’t fully replicate to actual unit, but it comes closer than the app, and is easier on the eyes.

The unit is “smart”.  There are tons of information available on the unit that can be accessed online - why is it not available for the user/owner?  And why does the display have to be so Spartan?

Ask the developers.";"2018-07-04T07:22:45-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=431904233&type=Purple%20Software";"431904233";228;"en";"POSITIVE"

The only significant complaint I have about the app is the constant annoying surveys.  They need to make a survey area within the app which doesn’t prevent use of the app, instead when you open the app a survey pops up and prevents use of the app until the survey is closed.  I deducted TWO stars for this.

If the surveys were a once a year thing then I probably wouldn’t even complain but they aren’t, it seems like they have been doing surveys once a month or once every couple of months and I’m sick and tired of them.

UX looks like it was designed by an engineer. If they were trying to make a confusing app with difficult navigation then they succeeded. (I have one thermostat device. Why are there two different settings screens in the app? Thermostat and other device settings should be a sub-item on the main settings navigation controller. Or just call one App Settings so it’s clear they’re different.) Nexia badly needs an actual UX designer, or to even just look at Nest app for ideas on how to make it less bare and ugly. 

That said, we no choice in the matter. We had to get a completely new HVAC system and the variable speed system we wanted was incompatible with Nest. It is what it is. Our big thing was to be able to tweak the temp without going downstairs and we can. But overall, Nest app was a fantastically better user experience, Nexia is definitely not an improvement. 

Hopefully devs are reading reviews and take this as constructive, I’m not trying to be brutal, just honest.

Second: (A) often there is a connection failure from the app to the thermostats
(B) Within the app I tried about 5 times to set a schedule but there was always an error or just didnt save the schedule. Had to use the computer browser interface to set it.

Thirdly: Necia does not allow for the user to set cooling temperature and warming temperature less than 4 degrees apart because, the app states, it could cause the system to switch between cooling and warming rapidly. The obvious solution is to let the user select which temperature control function is enabled like Honeywell smart thermostats let.

Also, Apple Watch, surely you've heard of it?  Not this developer.

So after my initial review the developer informed me they are ""working on being more compatible with Apple in the future"". Gee, thanks. Keep working on those iOS tutorials🤦‍♂️ But they had nothing to say about HomeKit. I guess they haven't started on that tutorial yet.

It took me 4 days just to get my phone connected! Why? Because nowhere does it say that two people trying to use the app to access the same thermostat must use the same account! It simply tells you to sign up for an account and take these steps! But halfway through, OUR thermostat showed something entirely different. After trying to find an answer over a 4 day period, I emailed them. I got a prompt reply telling me that I had to sign in with my husband's account!

I've just spent another hour trying (unsuccessfully) to set up a schedule! I've finally figured out how to do much of it but there's no explanation as to why Saturday and Sunday can't have a second time added (it's simply from 8am to 8am), nor why, when I adjust Monday it asks if I want to apply the settings to Saturday and Sunday, but not the rest of the week! But when I adjust Saturday it offers to apply the setting to M-F but not Sunday! And don't get me started on the frustration of setting a day's ""cool"" temperature, then trying to set the ""heat"" temperature - but if you change the heat a degree or more then what THEY chose, THEY change your ""cool"" temperature with it!

The Alerts feature was one of the most useful features for us. However, that feature quit working completely, including the disappearance of all alerts history. When I accessed the app to determine why I wasn’t receiving alerts anymore, there was a message indicating there were no alerts set for our home and instructions to click the settings button above to set up alerts. When I clicked the settings button, it showed at least 10 different settings that were set up. Despite them being set up already, I hit Save and was returned to the Alerts screen where I was advised, once again, there were no alerts set up for our home. 

Contact with Support via email provided no help. 2 days after sending my email requesting assistance, I received an email advising me to call them during specific hours and days. So I call during a specified time and day, negotiate the automated system prompts, finally reach a Support person, and am told to delete and re-add, then reactivate, my phone in the Nexia system. This not only doesn’t fix the issue, but now Alerts are not even available among my dashboard menu.....  So, I am advised to delete and reinstall the app completely on my phone. Same result, not fixed and Alerts no longer visible at all. 
Support then advises they need to escalate the issue, they will have to email their support (that’s right, Support’s Support person), but nobody is there at that time to provide them an answer. Why would you instruct your customer to call during a time when ALL levels of support are not available to actually solve a problem???
So, after a half hour of wasted time with “Support”, I’m no better than before and Alerts aren’t even visible anymore. 
And I pay an annual fee for this.....??  Probably not much longer....

  We have our Schlage door locks, Alexia, bridge, and my recessed lighting hooked up to it.  For us (husband and sixteen year old) we love it!  We all know when someone enters and leaves. It's even great for my parents who stop in from time to time.  They just put in their codes and they're in! 

 We have even used the app to unlock the door for our contractor who needed to stop in while we were at work.  No missed work for us.  Just had him text me he was at the front door, checked my Nest/Dropcam camera to see and clicked on the app button to unlock the front door for him.  You do need the person to turn the knob back to lock the door when they leave (this part I wish was better but this is a Schlage issue NOT Nexia).

 I have even setup the living room lights to come on and off when our codes are put in. This is a great feature for coming home at night.  None of us use the computer we just use the app.  

I will say you have to play around with it.  It is a leaning curve.

The only complaint I have is that it never notifies me when a recording takes place even though I set it up in the Alert options.  I don't know if I'm missing a step to activate this option or not.  The main point is so I know if/when someone enters the house.  If it doesn't alert me, how will I know? I notice it stops recording every now and then too even though I have sufficient memory remaining.  Also, we get power surges often and it takes over a day for the camera to reconnect to the network. It shouldn't take that long in my opinion.  Power surges last a second or so.  Once the power returns, it shouldn't take more than 10-15 minutes for the camera to reconnect.  I don't understand why mine takes over a day to reconnect.

Nexia needs:
1) ability to adjust schedule on phone. Currently,  can only be done by walking to wall device. 

2) ability to toggle FAN from 0-100%. Currently,  can only be done by walking to wall device.  (Note: I am not referring to compressor which is and should remain automatic)

3) ability to schedule FAN. Ideally, I might want fan (again, not the compressor or furnace but the FAN which circulates Air) to run a schedule of 80% during day and then perhaps a quieter mode, 35%, at night.  Something like that.  Currently,  can only be done by walking to wall device.  I manually turn fan up or down. 

 4) the Usage app...needs to get out of Beta and provide legit information.  How about eye candy line chart showing compressor percent by hour? 

None of this should be rocket science. The ability to do most of this exists on the panel already. 

At the very least...just copy Nest. At the best, please add essential functionality beyond a competitor.

Pros: 
Can set schedule from phone in this version. 
Easy clean interface. Try scheduling your thermostat using the AT&T Digital app. Seriously, it’s extremely painful. Too many steps. 
Many users mentioned the 1 degree variance between their phone and the actual thermostat. While I have seen that a few times, more often than not, it is accurate. This may have been a bigger issue with prior app versions. 

Cons:
The only con I can think of, and it is significant, is that the app does lock up frequently. And the only way I’ve found to get around it is to reboot my phone. I know, that’s not really acceptable but I’ve learned that if I don’t go too fast through the app, I can typically avoid these freezes.";"2018-05-25T17:53:51-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=431904233&type=Purple%20Software";"431904233";155;"en";"NEGATIVE"

Oh boy, tiles.

Fewer features than the last version. A horrible and confusing user interface. Possibly the worst use of green since the leprechaun was invented. 

There is no need for them to have done this update so poorly. The last interface was fine. You could tell at a glance what your settings were. 

Now you have to figure out where your thermostat is in a bunch of identical tiles. 

It's like someone said ""hey ios went to a flat design. And they used green in some buttons. Let's to really flat and really green."" 

Then someone said ""how flat"" and the designer was like ""totally flat. Like so flat you can't tell what you're looking at."" Boss goes ""but how green?"" And the designer is like ""oh we will use this sort of baby vomit pea soup green. And lots of it. It'll be awesome.""
