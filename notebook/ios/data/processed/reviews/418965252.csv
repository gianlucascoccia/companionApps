Paying top dollar for a home alarm that worked when it wanted to. 
Since Coronavirus came around seems they tightened up their services and are actually creating fewer problems for the people that reliably pay their bill. 
Would have to assume when all’s good in the world they have soooo much money they let their children run things. But when a pandemic comes around and millions of dollars in WiFi and cable bills aren’t paid. Because of people that are out of work and can’t pay their cable bill. Xfinity finally wakes up and properly services the good paying American citizens. 
Therefore, will say that at a time when Xfinity is going through hard times, would definitely recommend their services. 
As for my bill doubling in the second year of service. Even with inflation. It’s just not worth 200 a month for an alarm, WiFi and cable I’ve only watched for an hour in years. Like the original price. But, after a couple years, seems they now do as agreed, (finally, after years) monitoring my house without foolish interruptions of my business. Less frequent senseless outages. Now then, I have no complaints. But, the dealing with their equipment and services, prior to Coronavirus, has been like dealing with a drug addicted relative. Their always an angel till you let them in your house.";"2020-05-23T19:57:21-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=418965252&type=Purple%20Software";"418965252";231;"en";"POSITIVE"

Comcast has always provided excellent service for me and I’m a huge fan of all their services and applications. The Xfinity Home application does exactly what it’s supposed to do. The UX I great, and the development teams built a fast, pixel perfect, stable application. 

I do have a feature request: could you enable geofencing using the mobile application to automatically arm the system when I’m a certain distance away from my home? The technology is available, you guys just haven’t implemented it yet (at least with my setup). Arlo cameras and base unit do a great job of this. With Arlo, I can set the cameras to arm using a user defined distance from my home. When I pass the geofence, the cameras arm and start recording and alert me to motions detected. Having this feature would provide so much value to your customer base. It would keep users from having to manually arm/disarm the system and would increase security from forgetting to arm the system when away. It would really increase customer satisfaction and would put Xfinity far ahead of other competitors.

Keep up the good work!";"2019-05-11T22:35:11-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=418965252&type=Purple%20Software";"418965252";201;"en";"POSITIVE"

It also did not have a reliable remote activate/deactivate feature and when it would randomly go off all I could do When Comcast first offered a home security system I switched to it immediately!!   It has an annoying alarm tone when a window or door is opened once I have the system armed.  That happened a couple  of years ago when we had a severe storm in the middle of the night after I had armed the system and gone to bed.  The wind from the storm blew my front door open and triggered the alarm.  2 Police Officers showed up at my front door within 10 minutes.

I know and read lots of complaints about Xfinity but I think some customers are spoiling for a “ fight”.    I treat the customer service agents like humans trying to do their job.

This affected me with the driving focus turned on. We had a false positive alarm triggered over the weekend, and luckily while my wife was in the car and she got all the relevant notifications, my phone remained silent. This is partially due to me not having allowed my Xfinity contact through my driving focus, which I have now fixed. Unfortunately, you are unable to allow specific app notifications through the driving focus. However all focus modes have an option to allow “time sensitive” notifications. I believe a security alarm qualifies!!

If I were alone in the car, I may not have been alerted, and not been able to take timely action, even if that’s just making a few calls from the driver’s seat! Luckily everything played out fine, again as it was both a false positive likely due to our own modifications as we recently replaced the offending door, and I had my wife with me. This is just a minor change in iOS now affecting a fringe use case.

Otherwise, we have been a happy customer at this address for almost 5 years now, and had many reasons to appreciate both the security system and cameras.

Heck all the rules/automation for thermostat are gone except for low/high range which, in my opinion, is useless. 

The app has removed “closed” sensor from list so now I can’t have a 24/hr sensor turn off a light when it is closed. I only have the option to turn on when “opened” and A - Leave it on or B - turn off after set amount of time. Why can’t I have the light turn off when sensor is closed again?  Please bring back “close” state for rules/automations for lights. 

I can set notifications for open and close on a door and window, why can’t I setup a light to go with close state of door or window?  

Also, why can’t rules/automations include door locks and garage openers to work with arming state of alarm system and or with individual sensors. The app states “more rules on the way” but I haven’t seen any new rules. I’ve seen just to opposite - rules being removed from app and online portal for pc/Mac. Heck I can’t even view my alarm system anymore on my computer. I have to use my app now.

However, due to unlivable circumstances related to my health, I was forced to move and relocate to a new apartment down the street. Fast forward- Xfinity came to my new apartment to install the alarm system I had to keep for another year at the time (per the original contract). When signing the form at the time of service for the installation at the new address, I stated in writing that I did not want to be entered into a new contract. The Xfinity employee told me I would not. Unfortunately, I was entered into a new 2 year contract for a home that most certainly does not require an alarm. I have about 6 months left of the contract, Xfinity will not let me opt out unless I pay a $300+ fee, and now the useless alarm system is sitting in a drawer and half of the sensor batteries died.

From the app we are able to monitor all status and activity, what does open and close and at what times. We were able to like up out compatible smart garage door opener and front door electric smart deadbolt all to this one app. Soon we will be adding smart lights and thermostat all compatible to the XFINITY home app. 

The best thing we use it for now is to monitor when the kids come in and out of the house, when they’re not and suppose to lol. Also being able to choose and set the alarm from any location just with a mobile device is extremely handy.

The app lets us arm and disarm the system with several options and lets us manage each of the cameras. It records 24/7 so you can pick a motion event and watch it and even let it run past the clip if you wish by touching “play more”. The slider lets you fast forward and rewind at any speed exactly as you wish (something out Lorex app wouldn’t do). 

Watch footage on your app, your main xfinity security panel at home, any of your televisions, or on the web.

I find it funny that every other time my app would work but whenever the alarm was going off it decided to log me out and i would end up getting charged.

I know that my neighborhood should be contacting me prior to letting the contractors in but that’s another issue since I should able to use this app for what it claims to be able to do.

Also, I wish that it was smarter. When I leave home Homeboy is smart enough to arm my cameras. XFINITY Home does not arm automatically.

We are not using any of the camera features so I can’t speak to that.

The mobile app lets me bypass a sensor when the alarm is armed but that does not work and the alarm goes off if you don’t bypass before setting the alarm.

I wish you could bypass without disarming, but if you can’t the mobile app is really broken.
