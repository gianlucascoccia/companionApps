I like that you can take photos of your zones, create zone maps using an aerial photo of your home, etc.  It is really easy to use as hoc and in scheduled mode.  Many devices are one or the other, but this is eased or both.  This is real easy to use with Alexa too.  Will just say, “Alexa, ask Rachio to run zone 3 for 15 minutes.”  Also, I like that I can VERY simply select certain of the zones to run manually (quick run).  Literally can have that started in 10-15 seconds of zone selection time.  You can also allow professionals (your landscaper or sprinkler repair company) to access it.  This allows them to work on your sprinklers  without you having to give them your phone.  I gave this a 5 because it’s not a 4, but I think it is really a 4.5.  So far I can’t fully trust the automatic weather feature.  I am all about using water only when needed, but in our climate, if you give too little everything will die.  I noticed that it won’t run the sprinklers when the slightest bit of rain has recently occurred.  That slight bit of rain would never have been enough to get to the roots of the plants / grass.  The good news it is a easy to use that I turned off the auto weather feature, and I just manually disable the Rachio if enough rain has occurred or is obviously going to occur.";"2021-03-07T10:36:52-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=864325098&type=Purple%20Software";"864325098";254;"en";"POSITIVE"

Or we have it set to run every day but Monday when it will getting mowed, and instead it says next scheduled run is two weeks from now.  Often I’m shocked to find it running at various times when it’s not meant too. Often I find that it tries to conserve so much that instead if running for 15 minutes it runs for a minute or two and new plants are dying. One zone we can’t get to run, we have had a sprinkler company come out and verify, it’s getting power and water and it’s set up and programmed right, and was working on our previous system just before switched over. It is either so convoluted and too smart for its own good, with all the skips and conservations, or even when you program it to not be, it’s doesn’t run when it should.

A few glitches but nothing a restart of the app didn’t resolve. I think some issues people are having is internet connectivity. If you have mediocre WiFi in your home it’s probably pretty bad in your garage if the Rachio is located there. I have a access point in my garage and the Rachio shows strong connectivity in the client list. Maybe that’s why it always works. I would totally give it 5 stars if it had a RJ45 jack on the back to possibly run it PoE (power over ethernet) over a CAT 6. This would give it rock solid connectivity and may resolve a lot of people’s issues. Sometimes when I pull my truck in the garage a certain way it will reduce the signal to 60% (metal barrier). With a hard wired connection none of these changes in everyday life would effect the connectivity and cause people to post un researched problems and immediately blame the device. Oh, and on a previous post on how the Rachio got his WiFi password. This is a HomeKit device, that’s why you bought it right? You said you had a iPhone so you are prob a iOS and AppleTV guy.

I would like to see a couple enhancements. On iOS the Unit sends you notifications like on saturation of soil. However, when you go into the App you can’t see that same information. You can only see that it skipped. It would be nice to see those notifications in history on the app to understand why it skipped.  Also on the saturation skip it would be nice to have a choice to reduce water verses skipping all together.  I live in a very dry place and the ground doesn’t stay saturated for long.  My only choices are on or off.  Having a “reduce” option  would be great.

The Alexa integration needs some work (recognize more commands) but it’s pretty cool to be able to kick off the watering cycles.  I have had no issues with this unit and happy that smart tech is here for controlling watering.  You don’t have to be an electrician to hook this up and programming is pretty intuitive.

I’m using so much less water. 
  My only pet peeve is when setting up the needs of the zones for smart watering. It basically gives you two options: lawn & garden, and within those two categories you set soil types and shade or sun   That’s fine. It’s very helpful. However, it should also include specialty beds for specific watering needs, such as vegetable beds. To compensate for that lack, I use programmed settings to water, or manually turn on “quick watering “ to supplement. Not a huge deal.

If you tell it to be done by sunrise (the default/recommended choice), when it determines what time to START watering, so that it will be done by sunrise, it completely neglects to check the schedule it intelligently creates, and instead assumes all zones will be watering for their maximum normal duration.  For somebody like me with 10 zones, that means even though it’s only planning on watering for 4 hours, it decides it needs to start watering at 8pm.
Irrigation 101 dictates you should not start watering early in the evening, because by letting the soil and plant surface sit damp and dark all night unnecessarily, you’re going to promote disease.
This is clearly a bug in rachio’s algorithm... hopefully one they fix soon, as I already struggle with preventing brown spot in my zoysia and that was before I replaced my old school controller with this “smart” one.

Many functions but the most useful to us was being able to set it for an hour after sunrise so we could check for broken sprinkler heads. It automatically tracked sunrise times & adjusted according.

Rachio unfortunately is missing this particular function, so i have to re-adjust every weekend to following the shorter daylight :(

The Blossom setup was very intuitive where as the Rachio was a little more involved and i had to re-do it twice before it each zone was accurately location labeled. We only have 8 zones - so if you had 12 or 16 it would be extremely tedious!

Thats why it loses a star. Otherwise no complaints. Keeps its wifi connection from day to day. (Blossom kept disconnecting after Scotts took over :( 

Our city allows us to water twice a week (Tues/Fri) so the custom scheduling was also important.

Have been using it for 2 months now. If the sunrise timing function is fixed i’d give it 5 stars… i’ll update my review if it is added! Please !!!";"2021-07-25T07:19:29-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=864325098&type=Purple%20Software";"864325098";202;"en";"NEGATIVE"

I tried the other way to add my address and found no states in the dropdown. Turns out you need to select you country first, which they don’t tell you. Very frustrating.
CRASHED when setting up first zone…after finally getting threw the basic stuff. When opening the app up again, the setup process was over and I couldn’t find how to start that again. So, I deleted my controller to try and start again.
After deleting my controller, they didn’t mention anywhere that I needed to also reset the controller by holding down the button to reset it. Ugh.
When I got the first zone, again…, the app crashed at a different place and messed up my setup. So, I resolved to figure out the app with no guidance.

The only drawback is that the controller needs the included adapter for power, which means convenience for any DYI warrior, but it also creates and unsightly wire hanging down the wall and the bulky transformer plugged into an outlet. Which makes the slick controller look like it was cheaply installed. I would like to see a hardwired option.

1. Whenever you need the app, it first needs to update. Ugh. 
2. The app is slow in starting up. Ugh even more. 
3.  We mainly need the app to pause or stop the watering, eg during picnic or play. Well, considering 1 and 2 above, if you don’t want to get the food ruined and the blankets or seats wet, it’s faster to run to the controller and take action from there, than using the app. 
4. When you temporarily do not water a section, it’s hard to find it to start watering g again 

We still have sections running on an old non-app conventional Hunter controller. Much easier in cases of emergency. But, indeed, we need to do the seasonal and other adjustments manually there.

Do NOT buy this product. The app is very poor. You will not be able to set up an account since they have trouble setting up email and passwords through the app and online. It will say password not recognized and when you to reset it doesn’t email you the password. 

I know 11 people who have the same problem.
