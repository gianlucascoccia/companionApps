-Setup is unreliable. I’ll get the thermostat connected to WiFi and it will never connect to the Lux server so I’ll just be stuck trying over and over before I finally get it working.
-WiFi signal drops and doesn’t reconnect. I’ve had to reconnect these things 5x a year and often just leave them disconnected from WiFi.
-The App is pure trash. You can’t reconnect a thermostat to WiFi from the app, need to create a whole new entry.

This is extremely important since I don’t want people to mess worth the settings. But they removed it for no reason with the new updated app. I noticed the feature was still available until I had to unlock the thermostats to change some settings and the app no longer had that option to do a level one lock. Why did they omit that feature when the thermostat still supports that feature??  Then after the updates, both thermostats will lose connection intermittently and frequently with the app simply stating there's a firmware update. The new app also makes changing the temperature the most difficult process ever. It's almost as if they don't know what a thermostats primary function is. You can't change the temperature past 10 degrees at a time and you have to confirm multiple times to either pause the schedule till a certain date and time or cancel it. It's so frustrating and I don't understand who designed this. No one wants to be asked this. The old app was so fluid and nice and just made sense. Bring back the old app!

After installing it, I had to download the app, and then went thru wifi network setup. At first it upgraded the thermostat’s software. Then I was able to use the app to check the current temperature and change the temperature setting. I really like that you can look at statistics of runtime and temperature for 24 hrs on each day. I haven't tried to schedule temperature setting yet. But so far I haven't observed any issues and overall I really like the app and the thermostat.

Update: I was able to setup a weekly schedule, it allows you to setup 4 events per day. I have already changed the schedule few times. I believe the thermostat connects to wifi only once per hour in order to extend battery life. So any time you make any changes to the schedule it wouldn't take an affect until the thermostat connects to wifi.

I have never used an app less functional than this. This “ UPGRADE” to v2 made the app unreliable and unusable.

After numerous attempts at reconnecting the piece of junk I have given up. At least it controls the temperature even if I have to manually turn the dial every morning and every night. It was supposed to do that by itself. So much for it being a SMART thermostat. Oh and the app is still telling me everyday that it has set the away temperature, which it clearly has not. The same goes for every night when I come home. 
The Lux app I downloaded is garbage too. Sure I can see the temperature and the weather, but can’t switch the thing from heating mode to AC mode remotely. Why? Yesterday the high was 62 so naturally the heat had been on for a few days. Today the temperature is going to be 82! My wife would like me to change the thermostat to AC.

Not sure what the developers were thinking with this release. At first install, thought it would improve the WiFi connection. Soon after discovered even with brand new lithium batteries installed, it now drops the connection more often than the prior version! It just does not work. Not only that, this version is much more difficult to set up with WiFi and the app. And the interface is worse: vertical line charts for temperature and heat settings? And the visual interface for setting the temperature is just stupid: multiple slides to set the temperature? Who thought these designs was a good idea?

A customer should not have to spend an hour hunting for how to do something, as we are likely to throw our hands up in frustration and conclude we should have bought another thermostat (but on balance I love my Konos, particularly given cost savings compared to the competition).";"2020-12-05T17:00:37-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1001612622&type=Purple%20Software";"1001612622";147;"en";"POSITIVE"

My big issue is that this thermostat claimed to be Alexa capable yet I can never get it to work.  Alexa never recognizes the thermostat, which is terribly frustrating .  I have also tried connecting the thermostat to Apple HomeKit to see if it worked better than  Alexa but I can't even get HoneKit to recognize the thermostat.  So now I am forced  to find my  phone or walk over to the thermostat to make any changes- which totally defeats the purpose of spending money on a higher priced smart assistant enabled device.

When I arrive home in the middle of the night it is still 55, even though the app shows I saved and ran the warmer program. It’s 3F here so that was a nice surprise. In the morning I wake up, the app shows it should be 68, but the thermostat has reverted to the previous 55, despite not having it on pause or away mode.

I don’t understand why these units have such horrible battery drains either. A lithium battery designed to last for ten years, lasts about four months. If you are very lucky.

However in the app the new silly temperature control needle swings left and right, but the temp won’t change. Completely broken. So I can look at the heat usage statistics, but I can’t actually control the thermostat.

My downstairs GEO can’t connect through WiFi at all since the update, so it’s now a dumb thermostat.

Not as dumb as this app, though.

And to add the cherry on top, Lux keeps sending me email after email that my filter needs changing. They have no idea what kind of furnace I’m using or what the filter schedule actually is, but the emails keep coming and there is no way to tell them to stop. No unsubscribe, no feedback link. 

Time to research new thermostats.

Update: I just received two new Sensi Touch thermostats and two 24v plug in power adapters  which I discovered can easily be used to power the Sensis without a C wire.

They arrived just in time. My upstairs GEO is doing that thing again where I wake up cold because it thinks the room temp is six degrees hotter than it actually is, and I have to raise the temp to 76 degrees until it randomly fixes itself, after which I have to turn it down again after coming home to an overheated house. The online scuttlebutt is that the wifi circuitry is too close to the temp sensor; it heats up when there is heavy wifi activity or problems connecting, and the sensor thinks the room is warmer than it is. When it finally finishes whatever it was trying to do, it cools down again and your house overheats. I put up with that more than a dozen times over the last three years. But this latest travesty of an app update and the barrage of unstoppable emails was the last straw.

Goodbye, Lux.

Last update: removed the GEO and installed the Sensi Touch with a cheap plug-in 24 volt wall adapter. It worked immediately and connected to wifi and the iPhone app with zero issues. Up and fully running in about five minutes. Lux went in the trash. Downstairs GEO will be replaced tomorrow. 

For those who have two wire systems, on the Sensi cut the RH/RC jumper loop, connect white to W/E, red to RH, and the two wires from the transformer to RC and C.  (Doesn’t matter which goes to which). The jumper to cut is a little loop of bare silver wire sticking out on the right of the terminals. It’s labeled.

Then it keeps saying the device is offline, even though the connection was “successful.” Also, the cool vs heat settings will simply disappear. The troubleshooting instructions on the Lux website are useless. They tell you to take actions that are not even doable. For example, it tells you to simply toggle between cool and heat.

The app is pretty much useless.
Also the new widget does not show anything just - - for each thermostat. Question to the developer team. Has anything you guys developed ever worked? Maybe it’s time to give up on IOS.

There is nothing right about this new app, nothing. The previous one was simple, intuitive, always did what was expected, and I couldn’t find any bugs. In this new app, the bugs find you, i.e. set up a daily repeating schedule, then toggle between 2 events and 4 events and look carefully at the temps you had set for each day. And why is the choice only 2 or 4 events? And what are the red and green circles supposed to mean? Off? On? Heat? No heat? Stop? Go? And forget about doing an interim adjustment easily. It either works or doesn’t, if you can figure out how to do it. Hint: it usually doesn’t work. We have to walk up to the thermostat and do it manually once we realize that the app setting didn’t work. And yes, the thermostat has been reset. And how could I forget how the thermostat now loses its wifi connection anytime I turn the heat setting to off and leave it there for more than a hour. I’d go on but my thumbs are tired, and cold. Please make something that makes sense and impresses in its simplicity and not its complexity. Just give us settings and wrap them in human, is that too much to ask for?

Don’t get me wrong - I’m glad that I can now change the temp on the app and it works (like the old app used to), but now, when you open a thermostat in the app, click statistics, the last 24 hours usage and temp are missing. I can see how often the thermostat ran this time *yesterday* and how the temperature rose and fell over time prior to 24 hours ago, but I can no longer go into the app, and see how the temperature in the house change overnight at our other property. What’s happened? A bug, an intentional feature reduction? 
How on earth did this app get the green light. 

EDIT 2 11/30/20:  Is Johnson Controls’ plan just to piss off all the Lux app users so that we switch to other brands and you no longer have to support us?  When is the app going to get fixed so that it can equal how good the old version was? It is still frustrating and useless.  For example, one of my thermostats is on schedule and set to 72F. I want to dial it back to 68F. I do so in the convoluted app, tell it to pause schedule until 4:30pm. Click ok, and the set temp immediately goes back to 72F. I give up. It’s easier and less hassle to actually walk to the thermostats now and adjust them there. You’ve gone from a great product, to utter crap going to this “version 2.0” app. Never have I been so disappointed with a product. I give up. You are not responding to all the customer complaints. You just don’t care. 
To anyone reading this prior to purchasing- DO NOT BUY a Lux product. They manage to make the user experience unworkable after it working fine for years. You’ve been warned. Spend your money elsewhere. 

EDIT:  App was updated 4  days ago, allegedly, but *still* terrible. Updating the schedule in the app doesn’t necessarily mean the thermostat receives the update. Please get the app either at least as functional as the old version, or give us the old version back. Terrible. 

PLEASE respond to the many complaints on here about how crap the “update” to your v2.0 version of the app is being received. 

The new version is TERRIBLE. Overly complex and definitely focus was given on how it looked in screenshots rather than how an end user can figure it out. 

If you want to tweak the temperature until next period - good luck! Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. If it works, your new temperature either becomes a new “hold” temperature and your schedule is paused until you realize and fix it, or you actually get a pop up asking how long you’d like the new temp setting to last. Why is this functionality now broken when it worked before?

The home/away is now jacked up too. Previously it was easy to manually switch from home to away and back. Now those choices don’t appear on the location unless you have “smart away” set up. (Side note - smart away doesn’t work either). 

Oh, and if you thought you could use the web page to tweak settings because the app is so bad - that’s no longer available too. 

I used to love my Lux Geos. Simple to use, at the thermostat and app. Now, I can’t wait for them to die so I have an excuse to switch to another brand. 

Fix the “new, improved” app, or at least , let us use the old one. 

SO disappointed and frustrated.";"2020-12-14T07:19:37-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1001612622&type=Purple%20Software";"1001612622";606;"en";"NEGATIVE"

Also, we had to split our wifi bands to 2.4 and 5 and only use the 2.4 during set up. This was not mentioned in the original provided directions.
