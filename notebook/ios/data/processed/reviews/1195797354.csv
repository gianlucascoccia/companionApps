The recent software update did bring improvements such as the day review and automatic updates, but the camera’s are still buggy.

I inherited 2 more cameras from a friend recently and I found that all 3 of these cameras all use the same network name leading to some difficulties setting up. Also I found when viewing both from the app then switching immediately over to the integrated home app, one of the Cramer’s crashes every time requiring a hard power reset. The app isn’t bad getting around in but it takes WAY too many clicks on the GUI to get to any recordings from the cameras: see Nest or even the super smooth interface from Apples own Time Machine on MacOSX!

Another big hit is the inability to provide notifications only when you are not at home. Sure the new app has a button to press for away, but this all needs to be automated: also see Nest.

I hope the updates to both the firmware for the cameras and features for the apps continue to be released by D-link, as well as HomeKit capability improvements from Apple. I feel like it’s a solid product but needs support!";"2019-03-12T08:32:18-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1195797354&type=Purple%20Software";"1195797354";232;"en";"POSITIVE"

However features in this Omna app need polishing, specifically the recorded playback features. The daily recap feature is awesome, but only after the 10+ minutes it take for it to put itself together and finally play for me. There needs to be an option for these daily recaps to automatically create themselves everyday and save itself to the micro SD card. That way we can just stream it instead of rendering it every time we tap the thumbnail for that day. I just used it, and after watching I went back to the screen to choose a day, went back to the same day I just did, and then it started the long process again.... why? Just fix that and this will be an amazing feature. Also I run into a bug where it says only two people can be viewing at the same time something like that, but literally no one is viewing it only me. And I know because I’ve tested it with the people who have access to it.";"2019-05-16T13:38:51-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1195797354&type=Purple%20Software";"1195797354";190;"en";"POSITIVE"

It would help if the video thumbnails were bigger so a thumbnail might show a detail of what triggered the motion recording. Ability to download all or plug the micro SD card into a computer would be great, (My macs wont recognize card format) Then I could scrub through the videos so much faster in an app actually designed for video playback.

I appreciate the fact that the Omna camera gives you the ability to use a microSD card for more long term storage, which is something that I always wanted with my Nest cam, but what good is that if your home gets broken into and the camera is stolen?

I haven't yet found a way to integrate this with my Apple Watch tho that is featured in the video. A watch app is needed. 

No clear solution for notifications. I'd like an email or a notice sent to my iOS device, again as featured in the video, but it beats me how to set this up. Second day research continues. 

Would like a sensitivity setting for switching to night black and white mode. Seems to want lots of light to show color and darker rooms are often in b/w even during the day. 

Seems to me the most recent recordings should appear at the top of the SD card video file list. Or give us a sort option. Me, I'd rather see what just happened instead of the oldest content in storage. 

Desperately need the option to save a video to our Photos app. And yes, automatically to iCloud as well. The point made by another reviewer that a stolen camera makes a security camera worthless is dead on. 

Sound doesn't seem quite right yet. The camera speaker seems to play the sound the unit broadcasts as well as the sound from the distant app user. Duplex please. 

Security, vis a vis The Internet of Thingys. Please explain what you've done to prevent our cameras from being hacked. 

Motion recording smarts are needed. Yes, the suggestion that we be able to automatically disable certain cameras when the owner is home is a great idea. I don't want to have to dress up when I walk around the house at night. Or at least a very direct way to toggle on/off without diving into settings. Consider ""Off for X hours"" as a bonus. 

Documentation is non-existent. No. A quick start guide does not count as documentation. Maybe documentation would tell me how to do what I think is lacking. The FAQs on their site don't. 

A support link should go to this devices site info, not drop you into the general home page for support. 

FYI, for those who want to quickly delete all their video, just reformat the SD card - app will let you do that. All or nothing tho.

- Really needs a delete all or delete multiple function when viewing recordings from the day. Sometimes there is just way too many clips to browse through that aren’t necessary and deleting each one by one is annoying. 
- Need a way to either turn the camera off when I arrive home or turn off the motion sensor when I’m home. There is absolutely no reason to have this thing constantly saving video clips of me walking around my home. That’s just stupid and a waste of memory. 
- I wanted the motion sensor to turn on my Hue Lights when it senses motion. Worked great. However when I go to turn the lights off... the motion of the lights turning off sets off the motion sensor which turns the lights right back on again!!! It’s a never ending loop. Had to disable this automation for the time being. Please add a delay so that my lights turning off doesn't re-trigger the automation of turning them back on!!!!
