Sure, just understand what they are and set your expectations.  Otherwise, invest in a different solution after you do the research.  With the current system I can administer all six cameras as expected.  I'm able to monitor each camera with varying results depending on network performance which depends on cell service or local ISP and how well WiFi is performing on your home LAN/WAN... your mileage on may vary.  Again, can't blame the app for a poor local network or signal - if you can get a good connection from the camera all the way through the chain to your mobile device then all is good. Issues are really around poor WiFi performance of the cameras themselves... Had to invest in additional access points to boost my home WiFi performance to get reliable connections to each camera.

When iPhone 5S is on cellular connection only (no wi-fi), app works only in relay mode. This means you can not access videos stored on camera's SD card. Apparently, in iPhone-5S version, app checks if you are on cell connection only, and switches app to work in relay mode only. I was able to prove it using this setup: 2 identical iPhone 5S, placed next to each other. Step 1: disable wifi in both phones, launch SmartCam on both phones (one by one) - and you will get relay mode only. Close apps on both phones. This step just confirms that app on either phone does not work. Step 2: Enable WiFi Hotspot on one phone, disable cell reception on the second phone, enable WiFi on the second phone and connect to the hotspot created by 1st phone. Launch SmartCam app and you will see that it works in full mode, w/o relay. 
Support is not helping, ther official story is that Relay mode is used only if there is no enough bandwidth. The experiment above shows that it is not true.

1.  Let the app run in the orientation of your device.   If I am in Landscape, put the menu in Landscape.  I shouldn’t have to keep moving my device to portrait for the menu, wait for the video, and then move to landscape.  My iPad is sitting on a stand, this is extremely inconvenient.

2.  Allow us to see multiple cameras at one time.  Maybe support camera grouping for this.

3.  While viewing one camera, allow us to slide left or right to go to the next or previous camera.  Don’t force us to go back to the menu to chose a different camera.  If there is something happening, we need to get to the other camera’s quickly.

4.  Just because the internet goes down, I should not lose the ability to view my cameras.  They are on my network.  If I’m on my network, I should be able to view my cameras.  But they are not available on the local network if you don’t have internet access.  So, this makes them useless for security.

It first says, “Connecting...”.  Then after 15 seconds or so it says, “Access has failed.  Please try again in a moment. (simultaneous connection/network unstable)”.

But instead, I have to go into the settings to turn off notifications which I am likely to forget to turn back on. 

Regarding the SD card. It is true. It ruined my SD card it came with and I am now on a new SD card. I'm hoping that issue gets resolved. The SD card got ruined when doing continuous recording.

Among the many problems, broken server and frozen smart cam network are the most frustrating.  

Samsung’s server is down not only often, but when it’s down, it is down for days and days on end.  All without warning.  The smart cam is totally dead.

When Samsung server is not a problem, the Samsung smartcam freezes up when it cannot handle its local network conflict, like when two of us happen to access the it the same time .  Urrgh.  To unfreeze requires rebooting the smartcam.   And if you’re away from home, bad luck for as long as youre not at home.

Camera isn't bad, setup was fairly painless and quality is pretty good. I'm happy with functionality and because it's one of the only cameras that has on camera storage where I don't have to pay for a cloud service or set up additional equipment I consider that a large plus and the primary reason why I chose smartcam in the first place. 

The bad:
The motion area setting doesn't work, period. I set the region high to avoid my cats tripping the motion center and they do anyway. Because of that, the motion alerting option is useless. For motion capture, my cameras will miss events completely sometimes which is concerning and only capture a certain period of time even if there is continuous motion. Because of that I have been forced to turn on continuous recording. 

The Ugly:
The app is disgusting...seriously I can't believe a tech company like Samsung has something this bad out. It's ugly, clunky, unresponsive at times, and completely in-user friendly. There needs to be controls to move forward and back while viewing videos instead of having to go back and forth. Need to add a way to see an initial image of each motion capture clip so I can see if I care about it. Is it a car driving by or someone walking up to my house? 

Summary:
As much as I hate the app, I do like and recommend the camera and have high hopes of future improvements or integration with SmartThings.

If you have a really good and reliable Wifi connection then you will not have any issues as far as live streaming. I have internet service with Xfinity (Comcast) and getting about 33-50 Mbps on iPhone 6+ measured via Speedtest app. The delay is about 2-3 seconds monitoring live even with LTE not Wifi.  I'm waiting for this app to be able to view multiple cameras instead of viewing one at a time.  If that happens then for sure I'll buy two or three more.  The two way audio on the camera helps a lot if you're monitoring kids or pets. I only gave 4 stars because of not having multiple cameras on the app. Other than that then this is a good app matched with good camera. I've tried Arlo from Netgear and that is nothing compared to this.  Tried and tested both Arlo and Smartcam HD Pro and that's when I realized how good, easy setup, and reliable the camera and app. To the developer of Smartcam app - thank you but please... add mulitple camera view option.

I am shocked that I can not find the option view multiple live camera images on one split screen on my iPhone 5? If there is continuous movement (like my house was being robbed where are the recording saved? Can you save them to your iDevice or computer workstation ..in a cloud? Finally, I purchased the SmartCam Wifi Unit because I didn't want to deal with running cable wires all around my house but I am surprised that each camera has to be plugged in and there is no battery backup..so if not well hidden it can just be unplugged. It would be nice to have had iDevice Pan, zoom, tilt etc control and/or auto zoom on object moving. Also would be nice to add another iDevice or PC cams.

Slowly, but surely, I have had to whittle my praise down to what barely qualifies as a two star review. The whole point of this camera is to see who's at the front door! But every time I get an alert, pull up the app, and connect to the camera, it takes almost an entire minute before I can see an image, by which point the deliverator or friend is long gone! Then it takes another minute to pull up the recorded video, assuming it actually bothered to record this time, and hasn't destroyed the SD card yet... And don't even bother trying to pull up recorded videos if you're not on the same Wi-Fi in the same location! At least the new firmware appears to allow us to see who's at the front door remotely, and even talk to him! This is a fantastic idea, poorly executed but getting better. 

Now my big concern is that Samsung is moving to a subscription service. They just added their ""cloud"" service to the nagware update. If they force that on us, this is an utter waste of money, and to be avoided at all costs.

- If you turn off ""Event alert"" and turn it back on at a later time, you still will not receive events. I'm unsure how to fix this so I have to rely on ""Continuous Recording"" in the meantime. 
- Under ""Playback"", you oddly have to select the day after the one you want to view. It will then bring you to the day before. Why is this?
- The descriptions for some of the setting are not very understandable. For example, under ""Setup/SD Card"", ""Continuous Recording"" it states ""If you activate use of an SD card, the events will automatically be saved"". I'm not clear as to what this means exactly? Does this statement belong under ""Use SD card""?
I'd love to see some of these issues fixed, however I'm not sure how much effort is being put into updating this app. When I look at prior App updates, I see ""Other error fixes"". This is incredibly vague. I do not know if the App Developers are addressing any if the functionality issues or not?";"2014-04-24T13:00:56-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=519014699&type=Purple%20Software";"519014699";200;"en";"NEGATIVE"

The setup was super easy without any problems. The camera (SmartCam HD plus) works flawlessly with clear images even at medium resolutions. Even the night vision works well enough to be able to see my large living room in the dark. 

It's true that app could be a little better. The navigation needs a little getting used to, and there seems to be some minor bugs such as not being able to select 720p resolution for recording. It always goes back to default 1080p. 

Some people are complaining loudly that you can not zoom in on a recorded video, only able to zoom live one, but it's not a deal breaker. 

Otherwise, after selecting ""auto login"" and ""remember camera password"" options, I don't have to keep logging back in unless I'm switching to different network to access internet. 
Also I haven't had any ""time out"" problems either although I don't usually stay monitoring more than a few minutes.

The most difficult thing about adding a SmartCam to your network is getting it out of the plastic-wrap it comes in. The app, like any other, takes a little getting used to. I've had to reboot the cameras a few times but other than that, no problem. Costco's selling an updated version of the SmartCam with a preference setting that extends the dynamic range. It's killer.

I run it in the dark to keep an eye on my daughter, and I also see the IR cutting out pretty regularly for a second or more.  I get no audio through the app either which is part of the reason to have a baby monitor in the first place, no?  

My verdict is that the product is unusable, particularly when employing the iPhone app.   Samsung didn't take the time to get it right, so what might otherwise be a capable little gadget is relegated to paperweight status.

1.  There should be a toggle on and off button on the main screen to activate the the notices and motion/audio detection when you leave and deactivate when you're home.  Currently, you have to go through several menus to that.

2. I should be able to customize the alert tone so I can distinguish motion detection in my house versus a news alert.

3.  As far as I can tell, you can only automatically record motion/audio events to the SD card and not the app.  You can record to the app manually with 30 second clips.  This does you no good in the camera catches a theft/burglar and records him to the SD card if the theft then steals the camera with the SD card inside.

1. Good quality video day and night

2. Event alerts come on phone.

3. Free service 

4. Easy setup

5. SD Card has option to overwrite when full & only record events

6. You can play messages through speaker, set up a mic, or even talk through your phone.

CONS
1. No cloud based recording (what if thief takes camera)

2. No option to automatically record to your phone up to a specified storage capacity.

3. Sometimes it's very tricky to get accurate event sensitivity; night/day differences, bugs, focused event trigger, etc. Might need different settings for different times of day. 

4. It would be nice for there to be just a snapshot of event as a notification. This would eliminate having to pull video every time to decide if it's legitimate. Also, what if I don't have good internet connection on phone?
