It took me 15mins to set up including download apps into mine and my Dad's smart phone. One of the great function is it supporting many authorized users include my Mom's feature phone with different display names. if I triggered a sensor, the siren, my Dad and my smartphone will give us an alarm and a notification in the same time. My Mom's feature phone will get a phone call alert later on. 

Then, I found in their website, they do sale IP cameras separately, so I got 2 Wi-Fi cameras last Christmas, each took me 2-3mins to add into the system. The night vision and motion detection feature is pretty cool! If I go outside, I can access those cameras any time to spy on my parents and my cats. The most awesome thing is this time I can receive video alert if a event triggered! I don't think the monthly fee is expensive at all now, it worth,(I did hesitate, but I realized that it just equal 2-3 cups of Starbucks coffee).";"2014-02-28T16:38:03-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=572781326&type=Purple%20Software";"572781326";185;"en";"POSITIVE"

I'm very happy with the system but there are a few changes I would love for them to add to the app that would make it 5 star. But I it works exactly as described.  I've had no issues with its current specs. The video quality is amazing and I'm often watching using cellular.  The Apple Watch portion is buggy and tends to think that it's always in Armed mode and won't let me change it.  But most of the Apple Watch apps are buggy, so I'm not really going to hold them to high standards on that. 

Nothing worse than realizing I left my back door unlocked for days.  Would love peace of mind from looking at a log of door openings, and seeing if that door was ever opened in that time range. Currently it only logs if the alarm is currently set. 

An extension of that, I would love to get a notification popup on my phone if a door is opened. No matter if the alarm is set or not.  My sisters alarm speaks every time a door is opened and I found it very reassuring to know I'd be notified if the kids tried to sneak out a back door. Or if I forgot to set the alarm. Obviously this would need to have the ability to toggle on/off for people who don't want it. 

I would love to see a current status of door/window sensors.  Open or closed. Currently I have to set the alarm to find out if all sensors are in closed mode.   

And the ultimate wish, to earn an impossible 6 star review: I have tendency to forget to set my alarm.  I would love for the app to detect when I leave the area of my home and prompt me to set the alarm. (Update:  I just noticed there is an ability to schedule the alarm to go on and off on a schedule each day.  This is awesome will help with my daily forgetfulness.)";"2015-11-12T09:20:08-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=572781326&type=Purple%20Software";"572781326";345;"en";"POSITIVE"
