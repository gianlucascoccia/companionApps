Update 1/23/15: this new release was supposed to fix the schedule issue ""some"" users were experiencing. I can confirm that nothing has changed and the schedule page is still a total mystery. It appears to do nothing at all. Why could they not look at, oh, I don't know, the calendar app, to get a clue how to set a start and end time? Best to avoid this whole company. Going to 1 star. 

Original review:

I like the lights OK and the app is so-so, but generally does what I need it to do. 

I really want the lights to come on and turn off at a set time. There are so many easy ways to set two times, but Lumenplay went with a page that I cannot understand. If I change the bottom scrolling time it does nothing. If I touch the top time it resets what I just scrolled to. Genuinely confused.

The app contains no help and there is no link from the web page. 

It's way overpriced for this kind of quality and I can't give it any more stars.";"2015-08-22T15:18:02-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=929847289&type=Purple%20Software";"929847289";217;"en";"POSITIVE"
