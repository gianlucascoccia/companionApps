When we initially installed it, it was very buggy and we constantly had network issues. Then it started I to issues with the camera. We were told by “customer service” that their workaround was to unplug the camera every few days so it could reset (umm, really? Still no fix for this). It’s been fine besides that issue the last several months, but the network has been down the last several days. 

Bottom line, I wouldn’t purchase this alarm system if you won’t be at the home regularly. For us, it’s adequate, but it’s screwed us in the past not being able to arm the system. “Customer service” takes a couple days to respond to emails. 

Gave it 2 stars because the system does alarm as expected and send us alerts (although the notifications has also been down within the last 2 years which really makes this pointless) when we arm it with the remote.";"2019-02-10T19:58:40-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=615159814&type=Purple%20Software";"615159814";171;"en";"NEGATIVE"

The basic interface remained the same for the 6 years that I used it. The biggest draw to this alarm ecosystem was the DIY aspect and no monthly charges. I speak of all this in past tense because according to its website,  iSmart Alarm products are no longer supported and app functionality is being transferred to a third party company without guarantee of continued functionality. So those of us who invested considerably in their starter system and add-on offerings are understandably concerned that they invested in equipment that is being deprecated before our eyes. I found all this out, not by a courteous email from iSmart Alarm but when my system just stopped working. The third party “meShare” who will be supporting the hardware through their app for a year, does not guarantee functionality of the equipment. And even if the hardware eventually starts interfacing with the app and they continue free service and support past 12 months, they might switch to a monthly fee system which puts a nail in the coffin of what made this system special and worth it in the first place.";"2021-02-03T10:37:25-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=615159814&type=Purple%20Software";"615159814";209;"en";"POSITIVE"

I originally got the system because of the flexibility of it and the fact there wasn’t too many other choices at the time. Since then smart home security has exploded forward while this company has inched along. They promise new tech that doesn’t see the light of day for over a year. They’ve come out with 3-4 different cameras when customers are begging for other sensors or keypads. The finale straw was when I upgraded to the iPhone X and the app wouldn’t even open anymore. A few days later the company came out and said they were working on a fix and it should be out shortly. It’s been almost two weeks and still no update. That’s two weeks I haven’t been able to arm or disarm my system. You know apple contacts these developers and helps them get their apps up to snuff before major updates or new hardware releases so they’re ready to go at launch but somewhere along the way iSmartAlarm dropped the ball.  What good is a security system if I can’t use it? On top of that they cameras cut out constantly and don’t record half the stuff that should set the alarm off.

Their system at that time was having growing pains, and was flakey as hell. They have got it working very well now. But they are slow with new extensions, and don’t seem to have an overall corporate strategy to compete against the Nests of the work. So things like a video doorbell, that was promised several years ago, have not materialized. And their wall-mounted keypad, which started pre-orders in January 17, with schedule delivery in July 17, have only now in Nov 17, begun shipping. It is like they can only work on one sensor at a time, and each one takes a year to develop. The system is totally dependent on connection to their server — but has no monthly fee. I don’t think that is a sustainable business model. My suggestion would be to get some capital investment, offer a service that has 24-Hour monitoring for a monthly fee, and use the money to hire a whole bunch of people to build out the rest of the system sensors, and provide complete integration with other gear like Alexa.";"2017-11-16T10:04:52-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=615159814&type=Purple%20Software";"615159814";186;"en";"POSITIVE"

This alarm is perfect for a small place and I would make sure that the sensors are no further than 30 to 50 feet away from the Cube one unit
After reading many reviews I see that a lot of people are having problems and I think it’s communication because of the distance of sensors from the main cube one unit
Other than the Keypad issues I rate this unit four star
The software on the app is very easy to navigate and is actually very good to help set up devices
One huge plus this unit has is no monitoring fees
Siren is very weak but it should wake you up out of a deep sleep if someone attempts to coming to your place of residence

I would not recommend these cameras to anyone. 
They have a arm feature for motion sensing. I wish I could choose with camera I want to arm and leave the rest. This would be perfect since one camera I got from them once it’s armed it actually follows you when you move. This is a nice feature but I wish you could turn that part off. I would not invest in this company again and would not recommend you as well. Spend the extra money and get something worth it. 
Also to add I switched from Comcast to att thing the connectivity was because of my provider. Still had the same issue.

My main use for this is in my studio, I just want  to be able to set a time that it arms every day because sometimes I leave and forget to arm it. Would be really nice if it would auto-arm at 5PM every day, and even nicer if it could auto arm after a period of inactivity or ONLY auto arm at the set time of no activity etc. This should be simple enough to program but I have a feeling this is a smaller company than they let on and they just can’t prioritize these kind of updates. The system works well and I am happy with it, just feel that it is lacking some features that would make it mindless to control which is really what you want from a security system these days.

I’m very happy that we don’t have to pay a subscription fee for monitoring as other reviews on here have suggested. I can easily call the cops myself if I need to.

In addition, the cameras are frequently inaccessible and just spin on steps 2/4 of initializing - then if you try to clear the app, the entire phone freezes.  I am constantly power cycling the cameras and cube to get them back online.  Also, when the alarm IS triggered, my cameras no longer record any videos on any of the cameras.

Most problems were minor and the company was responsive. One day my alarm stared triple beeping (instead of single beeping) when arming and disarming. No big deal, just a little more noise, but everything still worked fine. It took 2 months or so for them to fix that little annoyance, again not a problem. For the last month or so, ostensibly following some buggy sprint, the app starts acting weird. Can’t see the cameras, can’t see the devices. Multiple restarts worked for a while, then even this workaround stopped working. Now it’s intermittent, but mostly broken. Tech support says to delete and reinstall the app. That works for a while then we’re right back to broken.

I have invested in an array of motion sensors, door/window sensors, and key fobs. 

When the system is operational it’s great, however, too often there are issue with the network server or the app itself. For example, very frequently there are several nights where the alarm is triggered but the app (or even the key fob) will not disarm the system. This means that I literally need to unplug each siren in order to silence the system. The issue with the network server will either prevent the app from disarming the system if armed or prevent the app from arming if unarmed. This has caused much frustration. 

Another issue relates to the app. It is not always responsive and will lock up when trying to login in or change to a different security mode. 

Due to the constant issues with system reliability, I am now considering a different system if things don’t improve within the next couple of months. Hoping they can address these issues soon.

Major design flaw of which the company has LONG been aware and has not attempted to fix!

Not sure what others mean by the app crashing, it hasn't once on me. After my home was burglarized, we bought the starter set for $150, and added 2 additional sensors. Not only do they set off an alarm that's louder than a car alarm if an intruder comes, but you get a phone call and alert on as many devices as you want letting you know which sensor went off. I love that the alarm is in the main room, so even if someone tossed a sensor or destroyed it, the alarm would still go off. I wish I had this a few days ago.

Prior to my purchase,I phoned the company, and they were very responsive to my questions. In the spring of this year 2017, the system started to go wacky, at first sending me notices of detected motion, even though the motion detector and camera were always in the same location and there was no motion.

Then it was the system going offline for days, until I had to unplug and plug it back in to get the cube back online. And this keeps happening.

It started to be one problem after another with another motion detection problem last week, when it culminated this week when I noticed that two of my window sensors were offline. 

According to my phone, all the batteries were ok. So, I removed the sensors but could not add them back (device not found). Then I noticed that the red light that blinks when a window is opened or closed was not working for any of the windows that were supposed to be ok. In setting the system to home, the alarm was not triggered when I opened one of those windows. 

In order to check whether the batteries were in fact ok, as the system noted, I took the battery out of the front door sensor--since that one flashed once when I opened and closed the door--and tried it with the window sensors. But nothing worked and now the battery doesn't work with the door sensor.

BUT THE WORST PROBLEM is that iSmart no longer answers their phone and everything as to be done by email and nothing gets solved. I've been doing this since spring with the first motion detection problem.

This last round as of yesterday included a non-attachment of a video for installing batteries that was supposed to be attached to the email (even though I had followed the instructions that are found on the phone), and a note that a software problem was showing that all the batteries were ok although they may not be.

I'm waiting to hear back and also checking into getting a new system.

The iSmart alarm system is junk, and consumers are dropped like a hot potato after purchasing the system.";"2017-08-30T05:08:22-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=615159814&type=Purple%20Software";"615159814";371;"en";"NEGATIVE"

Woke up this morning to find that all of my cameras and recorded footage WAS GONE- Upon lunching the app, it opened a blank start page, The kind you see when you launch an app for the first time.

As I understand it, this is a result of the compete overhauling of the app and after the initial shock wore off, I wasn’t upset, but actually relieved... I thought to myself “Ismartalarm must be turning over a new leaf. This is gonna be good” and was optimistic to be starting over fresh with the new app.

Boy, was I a fool to think that this app would get better under new leadership. From the get go, the newly revamped app was plagued with EVEN MORE PROBLEMS then the original! 

At the time of this posting, I have yet to set up a single camera. Because the app thinks I’m on 5GHz Wi-Fi, it says “Not supported” and won’t left me progress to the next step.  And to contradict that error message, right below it reads the text: “Using cellular data“ WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN? 

To make sure I wasn’t crazy, I went over to my Apple Airport router and disabled 5 GHz, and also turned off cellular data on my iPhone, but to no avail.

Ironically, the iSmartAlarm PRO app managed to save all my cameras, but they want $49 a month and to that I say... BWAHAHAHAHA!!! You’ve gotta be kidding me if you think that I’m giving you guys a penny. That’s not how this works- have to EARN OUR BUSINESS. 

Need I remind you that the previous owners ripped us off, so the burden is on YOU to regain our trust and you can start by giving everyone a free year of iSmartAlarm Pro and refunding the customers who are paying you to beta test this broken app. 

We’re not your guinea pigs, we are your customers. Everything you need to know to build a great app is right here in the ratings. You don’t need to reinvent the wheel, every bud, every feature request, every idea, is ALL RIGHT HERE, so I suggest you read every single review and build the app your customers have wanted for years.";"2021-04-06T04:23:02-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=615159814&type=Purple%20Software";"615159814";389;"en";"POSITIVE"

Tapping Arm/Disarm can take up to 10 MINUTES to be processed by the Cube, even on the same network as the unit and gigabit Internet speeds. But last night I still set it off with a 30 second countdown timer despite tapping “Disarm” frantically on two different devices. I had to listen to the siren while I fetched my key to unlock the enclosure physically securing the cube to kill it, which is inexcusable for an alarm system. 

The app, even the latest version, crashes randomly when I go to view a camera (such as to investigate a weird noise outside in the moment), and I have to reopen it. After reopening it you have to wait for it to log back in, dismiss some in-app full screen ad trying to get you to buy more hardware, and then eventually get to your camera. 

The app crashed for a month on the new iPhone X, which was announced and made available to developers to test on a month prior to the start of the month of crashes. I had to carry around two phones just to be able to use my alarm system, for a month. What does this say for forward-looking reliability to you?

Cloud backups of videos recorded during alarm triggers never seems to work. They just don’t appear. Same with most SD card features - don’t even bother. Just use your cameras in real-time and hope they don’t lock up and need their power bounced off and back on again.

The only integration you have with the Home app (HomeKit) at the moment is a janky IFTTT plug-in via HomeBridge, which does not relay state two ways. 

No firmware updates for a good 8 months. Which means the firmware in my cube, camera and sensors must be 100% perfect, but the other issues tells me that’s probably not the case. 

I’m going out of town soon and I’m hiring a house sitter rather than trusting an alarm system I’ve paid over $500 into so far, since last Christmas (less than a year ago).

Do NOT buy into this ecosystem, the company has completely given up apparently. The app is a joke, as is the backend it talks to given the massive latency for simple commands. I’m not sure if outsourcing is to blame or what, but it used to be a rock solid service until the past 4-6 months. 

Lastly: the packaging looks like they want to be the Apple of alarm systems. The software bugs make it clear they are definitely copying Apple this year on software development quality control 😂😂😂

I can also give other family members access to the alarm so it will not go off as they come in to feed my dog. If you're buying the system because of the camera then don't do it.

I used to have ADT and hated the $30 per month ""monitoring fee."" 

With the iSmartAlarm system you are notified within a few seconds of an activation. No monthly fees and no contracts!! Plus the top of the line system is only a few hundred bucks. 

The app itself is simple and very user friendly. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure it out. In addition to arming / disarming the app will send you a text indicating exactly where the activation is AND a picture of whats going on inside your home, office or wherever you have the camera installed. Plus an actual telephone call also advising of the activation. There is also a feature (that can be toggled on/off) that alerts you whenever a sensor is activated even when the alarm is disarmed. Great for keeping an eye on the kiddies should they try to go out to the pool or my teenage son, who will think twice about sneaking out in the middle of the night...!!!

The product, quality of the app, customer service, and even packaging is VERY Apple-esque. 

It is my understanding that they will be adding even more features such as fire alarms, smoke detectors, carbon monoxide detection, and garage door sensors! 

In conclusion, I HIGHLY recommend the iSmartAlarm.";"2013-07-11T17:36:09-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=615159814&type=Purple%20Software";"615159814";244;"en";"POSITIVE"

We didn't want to have a contracted monthly pilfering of our funds so we thought this was a good solution. It's super easy to set up and so far seems to work well. I agree with the first reviewer about the alarm not going off immediately if it is armed and there is an intruder. That needs to be changed. Also. I would really really really love to see them develop an out door camera as we have things on our property we would like to protect as well. I'm still learning the options and how to use it to its best. As far as the app goes. It's a bit hard to navigate. Ease of use gets a 2* rating. Menus are on different pages and confusing. Not intuitive. Things that seem like they should be together are separate. Buttons for settings are small and not obvious. Would love to see it completely revamped for easier navigation.

The original remote doesn't confirm the system's status as armed or disarmed, hence the preference to use the app to confirm the disarmed status after too many false alarms after the remote did not disarm it properly. The notifications setup was not clear after the update, as other reviews noted, but figured it out on the online forum before the developer comment below. 

Original review:
Do not update the firmware of CubeOne and the app. It screwed up our alarm system, as it no longer arms or disarms with ease, but requires closing out and restarting the app (a few times) and waiting much longer than the mere seconds required before. Also, despite having safety notifications set to ON, none of the notifications are being sent anymore. Too bad this update broke the whole alarm system; now we have to go with a real alarm company.";"2017-04-01T22:25:18-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=615159814&type=Purple%20Software";"615159814";161;"en";"NEGATIVE"

The folks in their tech department are fantastic, and truly work closely with their users to solve problems, including complex ones. 

A few suggestions for improvement:

1. Create optional integration with other smart systems. Nest, August smart lock, etc. Allow the app to know if I've set my Nest to away mode to automatically arm the system if it is disarmed. Allow the system to know if I've unlocked my August smart lock, to automatically disarm the system. Create fail safe rules for re-arming the system after an event. (If I unlock my August Smart lock, disarm the system for 5 minutes and then arm it again). 

2. Integrate with Apple home kit. This would probably make suggestion 1 a lot easier to implement. Your company is an iOS exclusive - the fact that you haven't integrated with home kit isn't good. When my phone or tablet is unlocked, I should be able to tell Siri to arm/disarm/set home/dismiss-siren my system without even launching the app. 

3. WHERE ARE THE SATELLITE SIRENS? :(

4. Create optional schedules and rules for automatically arming or disarming the system during certain a times of the day.";"2015-07-21T13:57:24-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=615159814&type=Purple%20Software";"615159814";220;"en";"POSITIVE"

A few quirks regarding the hardware :

-Had to remove plastic housing on the iCam to resolve a weird white reflection issue in camera app screen. 
-Cannot access camera remotely for some reason. I have other cameras I'm able to access from other hardware companies so I know its not my network. -Can anyone else access their iCam via LTE/3G/4G or via someone else's wifi network? Ive tried the static IP address as well as well as placing it in the DMZ out of sheer desperation 😖 (I know bad yea yea )
-I would like to customize sounds and edit the notification text.
-Motion sensors have strangely poor range and only detect motion really close up.
