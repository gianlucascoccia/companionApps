Granted the Apple Watch app has always been buggy but the iPhone   app (which is your primary access point) has always been strong. All of a sudden, about 3mo ago, the app updated and I started getting logged out of the app quite often. I don’t have a clicker so Garageio is the only way for me to park in my garage. You can imagine was a hassle it is to have to log into the app several times a week as I’m driving up to my house and trying to park. I’ve notified Garageio of this issue and they say it’s a known issue and they are ‘working’ on it. It’s been months and I’ve seen no progress in resolving this issue. If you’ve just bought a Garageio, return it and wait for this know issue to be resolved.

*UPDATE*
I was contacted by Garageio customer support about a couple of months ago and told that the new software was available and this version should stop all the issues that I’ve been experiencing re: the app spontaneously logging me out. Well, unfortunately they were wrong. I still continue to get logged out at least a couple of times a week. I’ve brought this continued issue up w/ customer support yet again and I’ve heard nothing back. There are other options out there to integrate a garage door into your smart home. I think it’s time that I stop fighting my Garageio and let it RIP. I just wish I didn’t have to replace a perfectly functioning device all because of a poorly designed app!";"2018-11-10T04:55:48-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=762037516&type=Purple%20Software";"762037516";275;"en";"POSITIVE"

The software doesn't seem to check the status of the door properly, so you can't know by looking at the app if your door is opened or closed. Which is a major reason why someone would buy such a device. 

Second, you aren't notified in a change of status. Door opens or closes? You'll never know. Even with iffft integration it doesn't work. 

Lastly, you get a notification 30 minutes after your door had been left open. That's it, no automatic closing, no option for any other kind of notification, no adjusting the time.

Still garbage.  You can't cancel out of Touch ID.  Eventually the app will pitifully give up and crash.  Still won't connect to the system.

You took a perfectly good app that worked every time and destroyed it.

Since this been going on the last 5 months now, I can only think that the company doesn’t have the personnel to fix it??? I guess they’re not interested in keeping their customers happy. If I were in the market for an automated garage door opener, garageio would be at the bottom of the list. 

So frustrating!

Update 03/09/19 
The “log out” problem was fixed, but now the swipe up/down function works intermittently leaving the app and the technology utterly useless.

The second Garageio box worked for a few months, and now it doesn't work at all. I've rebooted, reinstalled...everything.

Yes!  Problem is resolved. Such a relief. Increasing my rating to 4 stars. The login issue is gone!  Thank you for recognizing the problem and fixing it!  It’s unfortunate it took so long, but all is well now. 

Original review:

Several times a week the app requires you to re-login. Driving up to my garage all I want to do is open the door, but have to sit at the entrance and renter my credentials then open the door. Would be faster to get out, go in the man door, open the garage and return to my car to drive it in. Customer service has known of the continued issue for months. Still no fix. 

My recommendation is to go with another solution. I’m about to throw away perfectly good hardware because Garageio can’t fix a bug in their software. Run far, far away, stay away from Garageio.";"2019-02-18T05:31:57-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=762037516&type=Purple%20Software";"762037516";150;"en";"POSITIVE"

Very disappointed in this device.  It started to open spontaneously for no reason.  I purchased this device to make my garage smarter and home safer. However it has made my garage even dumber and my home less safe.

I called the company to report the issue and see if I could return it however they said I could not return it since it was purchased through Amazon. I contacted Amazon and they said it was too late to return.

These issues did not show up immediately while I was still able to return through Amazon. If you have purchased this I highly recommended you return it before you start having problems and it's too late to return.

Amazon was gracious enough to make an exception and except my return, probably because I purchased so many items through them. However I don't think most people would be as lucky.";"2017-04-02T18:43:06-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=762037516&type=Purple%20Software";"762037516";149;"en";"POSITIVE"
