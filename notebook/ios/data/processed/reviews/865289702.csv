We have our Scout integrated with Alexa and IFTT. This is ultra convenient for voice arming and disarming, as well as auto arming on a schedule.

The app is pretty good and gives the notifications I need. And allows good control.

I see this alarm as a deterrent to a burglar. And a warning to me as owner. Not a full-proof one. Though I think few are full-proof.

Sometimes there is a delay on sensors responding-due mostly to the location of the hub-so plan ahead on that. And I’ve also had sensor need to be reset to work at all. ...So on these points is where it gets 4 stars instead of 5. Ideally it would be perfectly reliable. But it’s pretty darn good. And if you are willing to monitor it a little the little things are workable.

I didn’t find a better solution for what I was willing to spend and for the convenience this has.

There's no ""immediate trip"" in home mode, you can't add anything other than their hardware - their ZigBee choice (ZigBee with a proprietary stack) doesn't support any 3rd part hardware (unlike the zillions of zwave devices - what were they thinking) and if you lose cloud connectivity you lose your alarm system plain and simple.

- screen does not refresh. If you arm/disarm the system, you now have to leave the page and come back (if not restart the app) to see whether the system is armed or not
- logs do not update in real time any more (similar to first quirk)...this makes it incredibly difficult to troubleshoot a sensor. You have to fully quit the app and restart it to get the updated logs.

Widgets do not perform well.
Icons are suppose to show in widget to indicate the state of each. 
When arming/ disarming your suppose to receive an audible tone on phone, indicating that has taking place.
Also, the widget showing activities ( access sensors etc. ) only shows blank lines with no information being stated.
Please note: widgets are not the app page itself, widgets appear when you swipe down from top of your phone screen.
After contacting support was told they were aware of problem and a new app was released to correct problem.
That was on 6-9-017 and I downloaded that update. Problems still exist even after uninstalling and reinstalling app on two separate occasions.
This is my second Scout system as the first had many problems with performance and poor battery life.
The new, and greatly improved system is working just fine with the exception of the app function as mentioned.
My wife has the same app on her Android phone and receives a audible tone on a arm/disarm .
