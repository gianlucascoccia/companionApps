Take that into account and this app update is awesome. The old swipe feature had its place but this looks more like a real remote and that’s what we’re all used to. The app is easy to pair and comes in very handy because the remotes that come with the Fire Sticks are crap. We have 3 Fire Sticks in the house (2 HD and 1 4K) and only one remote still works. It’s the remote for the 4K Fire Stick and we decided to re-pair it with the bedroom tv. The “d-pad” on the app needs to be smaller, it should be at the bottom of the screen for people with smaller hands like my wife and there needs to be more options that would be on a basic remote (like a sleep button or volume control) but overall this update to the remote app is a HUGE step in the right direction. Adding the remote listening feature, which is available for the Roku remote app (we have two Rokus as well), would be awesome too.";"2020-06-26T17:04:42-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=947984433&type=Purple%20Software";"947984433";192;"en";"POSITIVE"

I came on here in the reviews to see if anyone was having this issue I had attempted to unplug and re-plug the fire stick and I was still have the same issue. Today I decided to contact support through the app and selected call me, so I immediately got a call waited less than 1 minute and they actually helped me. She was able to take control of my screen and see what I was talking about she had me troubleshoot by reinstalling this app on my phone than unplugging the fire stick from my tv wait 2-3 minutes than plug it back in and to my surprise it WORKED i guess waiting before replugging helped because I had unplugged the fire stick before but not that long just like a couple seconds so yeah hope someone can find this helpful.";"2020-06-25T08:28:36-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=947984433&type=Purple%20Software";"947984433";235;"en";"POSITIVE"

(my mom must’ve had the app previously) It took me by surprise of how good it was! I functioned just like my fire stick! (My fire stick was awesome btw ;-;) But there is two things that irritates me. And one of them is when my phone turns off automatically, it would have a little “Reconnecting” thing. This didn’t bug me much, until now. Now, if you leave the app open for a long time, the “Reconnecting” thing will be a bit long. (Not too long, but enough to annoy me) And, there is the last thing I need to complain about lol. If you leave the app for a long time, the thing I just said above is if your fast enough to come back. If you leave it for a long enough time, when you come back to the app, it shows how to connect to your fire stick TV. Now, this happens a lot, and it’s really stupid cause it takes so many taps just to be lucky and actually connect to it. Let me get straight to the point. Sometimes if I try to connect to it, (which means tap on what my TV is called) it doesn’t work. It’s like a frozen screen, but it’s not.

My remote works fine for one button press and that’s it for up to 15-20 minutes. My iPhone app does the exact same thing so if I want to watch a Netflix program, I have literally had to click Netflix with the iPad, then while it’s getting ready to use again I try and type in what I want to watch, then when I’m done with that, I have no choice but to sit and wait 10 minutes for either the iPad or iPhone to work again then repeat the process, till I am finally able to get to a show and push play before it freezes again. Which, being as it’s only job on the world is to change channels and it can’t do that, then you’re quite lucky I gave u two stars instead of one.

Now, after I’ve had  Fire TV on for a bit & it asks if I’m still watching  but when  I open the app my fire TV (usually only one device, mine) shows up as in the cloud and not on active wi-fi. I close the app out, re-open, select my device and it just shows “connecting” until it finally says “Cannot connect”. I even reset my phone, turn it off/back on, disconnect from wifi/reconnect but I’m unable to get back in my device to “continue watching because it shows in the cloud (not on wifi) while my other device shows on wifi as normal. So, it’s not an internet issue, as one device shows on network & one doesn’t and it’s not a loose Fire TV connection issue as all my fire devices are permanently attached to and behind the TV, on wall mounts without cords accessible or in the way of traffic & zip tied in place.

There was another remote app that has this, but it wants you to pay to subscribe and does not seem to be as good as this app. The only major downside of this remote app and other remote apps I’ve looked into, is that they don’t seem to have volume control options, so I’m still going to have to buy an actual remote because of this.

Its design is painfully obscure to use, making menu navigation maddeningly impossible. Inexplicably, neither a screen interface appears on your phone nor does a cursor appear on your smart tv. It’s clumsy, offering no reprieve from its terrible mismatched jigsaw puzzle of functions that seem to argue with you as you try them out in vain, systematically destroying your patience and sanity one step at a time. It’s about the only thing advertised as ‘free’ whereupon installing it you realize the steep price was your time and effort, and suddenly looking for the microscopic, equally unlabeled remote lost in the physical world is no longer so Herculean a task.

Yesterday it connected instantly on the 1st try. Other days it's all over. Inconsistent. The only complaint I have other than the connectivity (which I can get over) is the fact that you can't control your TV volume. They should have a volume feature built into the app itself to allow manual control of the volume instead of using the TV's volume functionality.

A NIGHTMARE. The only reason I’m using this is because the remote constantly stops working. Which is a common problem I see from the reviews. I’ve only had my fire tv two years but I’m giving it up and purchased a new LG due to the crappy remote and app. What’s the point of the tv if I can’t control it?

There are two main issues that I have with this App. The first one are connectivity to the actual fire stick.

The issue is the app automatically times out the pause and play button leaving the home button in the exact same place where you might have wanted to press pause/play.

It’ll kick me out, I’ll go back into it and the screen follows my touch, but never translates it to the receiver. I tried to give in and just buy a replacement remote, but $30 for a REMOTE is psychotic. They want consumers to buy more Fire TVs so they make them the same price as a replacement remote.

I like that the main navigation arrows are nice and big, but as soon as you slide up the pause/rewind/fast forward controls, the down arrow becomes too small and you end up pushing buttons you didn’t mean to.

On top of that, even when it IS working (very rare) the button layout is unintuitive and difficult to use. Why don’t physical volume buttons control the volume?

As a basic remote, it is barely capable.  It disconnects at least 90% time you switch between apps, forcing you to choose your Fire TV device over and over again.

Sometimes, when you choose your device, it still won’t connect, and you have to restart the app before it will let you connect again.

Here are a few suggestions for improving this software:

- Make connection between the remote app and device seamless (user selects the device ONCE, app remembers which device it connected to last time and automatically connects QUICKLY, and only has to select device again if they wish to SWITCH between devices)

- Add private listening (listening through phone), which is available on the CHEAPEST Roku devices, but not the flagship Fire TV Cube device (yes, I know there is support for Bluetooth earbuds, but let me use my phone)!

- Add interactivity between what you’re watching/listening to and the remote app (show actors, related content, etc)

- Add a recent/suggested page to quickly access shows/channels that have been recently used on the Fire device";"2018-08-13T17:40:58-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=947984433&type=Purple%20Software";"947984433";189;"en";"POSITIVE"

It loses connection constantly and sometimes kicks you back to the beginning. Between episodes on Netflix it takes more time to get it back alive and hit skip than to just wait it out, and a new episode will start before you can cancel exit. 

That’s not so bad though. The really silly part is once the stick goes to sleep, you can’t reconnect. They didn’t think of having any WiFi feelers our while it’s in standby like with the BT remote apparently. So you basically have to unplug it and plug it back in each time you want to use it. 

I’d give it one star except it’s technically better than throwing the hole thing away when your remote suddenly decides to quit working. Yeah, my remote just gave up the ghost. I assumed the batteries were dead (even though it’s supposed to alert you of low battery), but no, in between episodes one day it just decides to say that there is no remote connected to the stick and that’s that.";"2019-03-28T21:15:19-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=947984433&type=Purple%20Software";"947984433";200;"en";"NEGATIVE"

But I'm wondering if you have thought to develop a remote that is more accessible to the elderly who have difficulty with the regular remote. It's very small and the buttons are not labeled other  than the play, stop, pause etc. symbols.

For example, my mother had a stroke about 2 years ago and is unable to use the remote and she can't use Alexa because the stroke affected the language center of her brain so her speech is poor. Someone always has to sit with her and find something she wants to watch. She doesn't understand the functionality of the remote. 

However, if she could see  pictures of what was available, to watch (on an iPhone/iPad  remote), she could select the one she wants. Then, the remote could display what she is watching, with the play, stop, rewind, forward functions. It would also help to have the name of each function next to it. She can usually understand the words. 

I don't know where this information goes but it would be really great to see something like this.

Another issue is that sometimes (like just now, which is why I’m writing the review), I try to adjust the volume a few clicks, and it’s like the digital button sticks.  I clicked the volume up button twice, the app crashed and I had to just watch as the volume kept increasing to maximum.

My other gripe is with the very nice touch pad of sorts. I wish the gestures were reversed. Currently to go right you have to stroke left to right versus right to left (similar to turning a page in book) which is far more of a natural gesture.
