After a few months though, the cameras would be unresponsive until rebooted. In addition, the laser on the camera—which I use to entertain my cat—is no longer in the center of the camera view. The laser has drifted to the bottom right corner, despite finding no physical damage to the unit. 

This could’ve been a wonderful cat camera, but I’m uncomfortable with the lack of reliability and awkwardness of the laser pointer.";"2020-11-23T05:12:35-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=977591137&type=Purple%20Software";"977591137";80;"en";"NEGATIVE"

I noticed in the gallery there were videos of someone’s kitchen and a dog playing...caption said she was impressed she could watch her dog play while she was in Canada. She would be not so impressed that I could see her dog play too. Finally got that deleted and attempted to contact support. No response. Next time I logged in, those images were gone. Used it a couple of times to check on dogs when we were not home, worked ok. But then, I was sitting in my kitchen and I heard the camera moving. I keep it facing the front door when not using and it moved and was looking at me. I thought it was my husband who also has access, but he swears it was not. I removed his access and faced the camera back at the door. I came home the next day and it was facing a different way. It went back in the box and has been in a closet ever since.

To start off it rarely starts the first time. I catch a glimpse of the ui and then it crashes. Usually on the second attempt it will open up to the app ui. 

Secondly it rarely connects my cameras on the first attempt. I usually have to try 20 different times, alter my wifi to less secure settings for the cameras to even join, usually after about 15-20 attempts it connects. 

This last time I was rounding on the 30-35 attempts when I decided to try to connect the cameras using my wife's iPhone. It connected first time, no problems...why would I have thought that would be the solution after I have been able to connect using my phone before?!

Thirdly, don't even think about contacting support. When I have contacted support (I never wanted to attempt to speak to technical support because of the instructions that came with the cameras which is very minimal) it took MONTHS before they got back to me with any sort of attempt to reconcile my issues. 

When the cameras and app work they are a great tool. We use one in the nursery and another in the playroom and love the night vision, oh my goodness is it good.
