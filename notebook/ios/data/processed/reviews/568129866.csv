I have never had any issues with it. The video stream is super clear and I can hear everything. I have it set up to email me when there is motion and it does do that well. 
There are two reasons I only gave it four stars instead of five. One is that I had a friend go check on my house the other day. He said he stopped in front of the camera and waved. I did not get a notification of that. TwoI wish there was a way for the camera to start recording if there's motion, instead of just taking a snapshot.

These reviews are obviously not real. We use our 1 camera for a baby monitor. We use the app to hear and see the baby. Worked great for about 2 months and now after they updated everything so many times the app can't seem to find the camera on my network. We can get it to find the network for long enough to start the camera, but after a couple min the app will crash and read ""network connection cannot be established."" Yet when I exit the app and open it again, lo and behold my camera is magically connected to the network and I can turn the camera on again for a couple min. before crashing again. I highly doubt it's my wifi going in and out because this has been going on for almost 2 months now. I tried to call about it and email about it but no response is given. I'm sorry you wasted your money buying this camera if you can return it, do!

I installed them around the house. I use them as security monitors and as a way to keep up with the pets when we are not at home. 

One of the cameras has failed completely. Two of the cameras shut down frequently and require rebooting to come back on line. One of the units, the only one of my five that I have mounted outdoors, under the eve of the front porch, functions well. It requires only minor tweaking every month or so. 

The fifth unit functions relatively well. On occasion the picture washes out, but it often resets itself, or it too requires rebooting!

I suppose for the money I invested in the cameras, I should be disappointed. I tell myself, ""you get what you pay for!"" But for the most part the cameras (with the one exception) are performing... but with some inconsistency!

That inconsistency is most troubling when traveling, and I call up the units on my iPhone and can access only one or two!  I'm fortunate that rarely are the four working cameras off line at the same time.
