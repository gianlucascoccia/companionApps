At some point I'll have to make a video detailing the issues, but for now here are a few things: The app often has to be killed in order to accurately update and provide live results. While the user interface is quite attractive at first glance, it is extremely non-intuitive and difficult to use, not to mention it is outright glitchy. It gave me an alert asking me to tell it what room the device was in. I swiped the alert, but no option came up in the app itself to insert this data. 
At the bottom of each reading, there are tips. If the tip is more than a sentence or two, it is followed by ""..."" If you try to click the ellipsis to read the rest of the tip, you are instead taken back to the home screen. If you try again to read the remainder of the tip by clicking the arrow underneath it, that doesn't work either and instead you're taken to a poorly designed graph of logged data. If you click the top bar of the logged data in order to return to the previous screen, you are instead presented with a bewildering list of options for the chart, which you never intended to look at in the first place. If you want to get back to reading your incomplete tip, you need to click the tiny home button, reselect the category you were looking at, and then swipe to the tip. However, you will NEVER be able to read the remainder of the tip (as far as I can tell). Apparently they want to keep it a mystery.

The latest version crashes on starting it. Tried deleting app, restoring phone. The app is now broken. :(

Update: the latest version is great and generally have not encountered many bugs and generally have not had to restart the app. The new app with the new firmware update seems to have resolved problems that many reviewers had. I've changed my rating to 5 stars. I'm glad to see the Foobot team so active in providing timely updates.

I suggest disregarding reviews prior to July 13 as they are mostly irrelevant now.

--------

The Foobot is getting better with every update. At first, this update caused wifi connectivity issues before the Foobot's firmware was updated a couple days ago. Now WiFi issues and app stability seems better than ever.

A couple minor things. I am not impressed with Breezometer for outdoor air. I would use Plume Labs API for outdoor air quality and graphs of outdoor air. If it's not available for a specific area, then use Breezometer.

The 5 minute live graphs look nice but aren't intuitive. It took me a while to figure out how it was graphing 5 minutes. Basically, the graph shrinks with time.

Pollution events may not be working as well this update. The air in the house got over 100 ug/ml and Foobot didn't ask me to tag the event. I tag the events without notifications, but it would help if they work.";"2017-01-10T14:01:43-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=909284570&type=Purple%20Software";"909284570";250;"en";"POSITIVE"

As air quality gets worse and wore (and ever more polluted air goes east from deadly pollution central -- China -- towards the west coast of the US and even further toward the midwest), you and your family will literally die -- or at least live much less of a life -- without devices such as the FooBot. 

FooBot is so sensitive, it'll even tell you when toxic chemical VOCs (volatile organic compounds) from your very own cleaning products are in the air. Awesome!! 

Of course, it also does particles, too, including the ever harmful pm2.5. Google all this and you'll see how the foobot is really a dream come true. It really is the first device to really tell you what you actually need to know in a reasonably priced package.

Environmental medicine has become one of the most important kinds. See Dr. Crinnion and others online to learn just how important this to to genetic and epigenetic expression. I think Dr. Crinnion even has youtube videos now, so please check them out for your own good. He does some wonderful studies, but can talk to a lay audience in an entertaining and clear way we easily understand.

If you want to live a happy life and avoid things like cancer, you will absolutely NEED healthier air. Period. It's just NOT an option.

Pair this with a great air filter or two such as the IQAir or AirPura, and you are at least 10-50x better off than you were before. Seriously.

That said, I hope they convert this app to also work with the ipad. Most members of the family have the ipad. I'm the only one with the iphone. I'm sick of them bothering for my phone when the foobot turns orange. This is the only real reason I've docked it a star. Thank you :)";"2015-11-10T00:25:43-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=909284570&type=Purple%20Software";"909284570";314;"en";"POSITIVE"
