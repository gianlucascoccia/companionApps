 Trying to find other stations on the Bloomsky network without mapped or GPS tagged locations is kind of hard, so I just wait for an interesting station to get shared on twitter.

Essentially, I wish the app had more options for exploring the weather measurements that the station is capable of obtaining. Things to consider would be graphical data for past measurements. Ideally these could all be over-layed on the same graph (see WeatherUnderground's interface). Possibly a forecast graph could be included as well.

It's easy to setup and so far has been reliable. 

I would like the time lapses to have a few more frames to add a little more motion to the day, especially for win detection. 

If there was a way to add a rain gauge as well as a wind speed and direction indicator then this would be near perfect. The little water sensor pad today takes quite a while to dry out after being wet.

Apparently, this failure to connect is quite common, because the app connected me to a page on their website that described different failures and presented a form to fill out, saying that technical support would contact me within 24-48 hours and resolve the problem.

The unit itself is beautifully designed, solid construction, and works flawlessly. Setup was quick and simple. Took less than 5 minutes to get connected to my home network and immediately started recording weather data and photos.

The app itself is clean and simple. Being able to quickly view the current weather stats and sky view from my iPhone is very cool, and the end-of-day timeless of the sky from my home is now something I look forward to every evening. I'd give it five stars except for an obvious omission which I'm hoping they add in a future version - it doesn't display any graphs of the weather data it's collecting, making it far less useful than it otherwise could be. That was something so obvious I just assumed they would be there, so their absence was a real disappointment. I can view the last recorded sample of temp, pressure, etc. but unless I remember what they were the last time I checked I don't know which way they're changing and by how much. BloomSky is obviously collecting all this data so it would be a simple matter of adding a few graphs the the app to display it to the user. 

Still, it's a great start of what I hope will be a continuing evolution in personal weather data collection and dissemination.
