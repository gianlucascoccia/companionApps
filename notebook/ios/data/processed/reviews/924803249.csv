I would take those with a grain of salt as the apps responsiveness is heavily dependent on the connection speed and quality of the homes wifi network. For reference, I have a Netgear Orbi mesh system, am seeing plenty strong WiFi speed/strength at my main panel. Install was relatively easy, though I ended up having to invert my phases after install, which took a bit of support searching to find the advanced settings to do so. I also have solar monitoring and can confirm that the real time feedback of Neurio mirrors the generation figures I am seeing on my separate monitoring app supplied by my solar installer. On the consumption side, the reporting is near instant when a device cycles on (example A/C, pool pump, microwave, coffee machine). Loving the data so far and can’t wait to see what kind of stats I can play with once it does some learning. For all of those complaining about the iphoneX scaling—BFD...the app UI works just fine, regardless of not scaling full screen. People are petty. For what it’s worth, I was originally going to install a Sense CT monitoring system, but their CT clamps were too large for my bottom fed bus bar style main panel. Neurio’s “universal CT” clamps were the PERFECT low profile fit for my setup, so that alone made this system worth it!";"2019-08-17T14:59:31-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=924803249&type=Purple%20Software";"924803249";245;"en";"POSITIVE"

I’m starting to think this must have been the cheapest one available.  It won’t stop crashing or locking up forcing me to crash. Sometimes it’s so bad I have to reboot my iPhone just to get the app to open.  I’ve only had the app 5 days.  
When it does work, I like it. I have 2 Sunny Boy inverters by SMA and this app is more responsive and timely with the data then the SMA app.  It would be nice if it would auto refresh. Every time you view it, you have to switch screens and switch back to get the history chart to update. It would also be nice to be allowed to zoom out on the run chart.  Other whole home monitor systems also allow you to label the devices that turn on and off.  You can instantly see the spike when turning a device on or off, but there isn’t anyway to label it and then see a list of what’s on.   
All in all, a decent entry level monitoring system, but they must first get the app to be stable; this is very frustrating as it is today.";"2018-12-01T06:25:48-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=924803249&type=Purple%20Software";"924803249";212;"en";"NEUTRAL"

The software has always been abysmal though. And generac buying neurio has not changed that. Since then, the only thing that’s changed has been the app name and icon, twice. 

It’s slow to load/open w data.
Still no support for recent iPhone resolutions (looks like some kind of clown app).
The detection algorithms need to be completely retaught and re thought. They are useless and that section of the app barely works anyway. 
You can’t export the entire history of data at once in app or online.
No integrations with other platforms ie SmartThings.

This goes in your power panel and sends power usage data to Neurio's servers using WiFi. It's not cheap, but it's worked reliably for me for over a year. 

I've owned several power monitoring systems, but the Neurio is the best I've had. It has separate input for mains power and solar power so you can track your generation and compare to the grid. 

It has a feature that attempts to identify which appliances are active and maintains a running total. This gives you insight into how much power a specific appliance uses. It tracks things like AC, microwave ovens, refrigerators, heaters, and virtually any other device that pull significant power. It will generally not be able to detect small appliances or devices that use less than 400 watts. 

The feature I use most often is the 'Always On'. This attempts to identify your lowest power usage that is always on. When I first started using this app, I had over a 1000 watts that was always on. This was items like wall AC adapters, lights, and various electronic devices. By converting to LED bulbs, adding some timers, or just unplugging unused devices, I was able to get my always on to under 500 watts.  That's still a bit high, but 500 watts saved that was on for 24 hours a day really adds up!

This app does has a few flaws, but the Neurio team is issuing updates on a regular basis.";"2016-05-27T06:20:24-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=924803249&type=Purple%20Software";"924803249";254;"en";"POSITIVE"

I researched all the other offerings out there and this one kept staying at the top of my list.

Glad I bought it.   I wanted to figure out why my electric bills were consistently $300+.   With Neurio over the course of 3 months..... We have reduced our bill to less than $110/month.   I foresee being under $100/month within the next month.

I had used a killawatt meter to check various appliances before but you don't get to see the whole picture.   I just used it to make sure I knew my fridge and freezer didn't have a stuck defrost timer leaving the heating coil on and that they were drawing less than the name plate rated amps.

Using Neurio, quickly saw various improvements could be made.   Checking what various items used.   Lights, lamps, TV's, ceiling fans, furnace, AC, fridge, freezer, dishwasher, dishwasher with heated wash and dry cycles, outdoor lights, dehumidifier and various vampire loads like satellite receivers, computers in sleep, monitors in standby...etc.

Invested in some inexpensive LED bulbs from Menards.   Adjusted refrigerator and freezer set points to the temps they should be.... We're too low before.   Got the family to make sure they stop leaving lights on all over the house and start turning ceiling fans off when not needed.

Amazingly, my ceiling fans are horrible energy wasting devices.    Researching further.... They make decent ones, they just cost more, so keep in mind.... It all adds up, so pay attention to the wattage each device uses and note that better more efficient models are available.

This all possible due to being in the know because of Neurio.";"2016-02-13T08:19:05-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=924803249&type=Purple%20Software";"924803249";291;"en";"POSITIVE"
