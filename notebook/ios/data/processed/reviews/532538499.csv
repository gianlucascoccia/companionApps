We live in the Denver metro area where temperatures and weather conditions can vary greatly across the area. I can check the temperature outside my house and then look at the temps across the area. I can see how much colder it is in the mountains than on the plains or between where I live and Boulder (this is in the map portion of the app). If you swipe left in the app, you can see pollution levels (helpful if you like to exercise outdoors). I love how the device warns you when the CO2 level is too high in your house. I also like that I can see noise levels. The app will alert you to any hazardous weather conditions in your area if you turn on the alerts. We recently purchased and installed the wind and rain gauge. Hopefully, we will love them as well. I find Netatmo an extremely useful device.";"2017-12-01T11:23:34-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=532538499&type=Purple%20Software";"532538499";166;"en";"POSITIVE"

Old review, but still true...
The temperatures are highly inaccurate. It was in the low 80's yet they listed the ""Feels Like"" temperature at 117. The temperatures on all units are off by about 2-2.7 degrees. Still no way to initiate an immediate reading from the app. You must rely on old data or physically access the base station to request a reading. The additional units lack in functionality. I thought they included decibel meters but they are only inaccurate thermometers and supposedly measure CO2 levels. Those are also insanely inaccurate. Their support department takes about a week to respond and doesn't actually help you with the issue. I'd avoid the app unless you are only wanting inaccurate temperature readings. The other information is ridiculously inaccurate or just completely fabricated.

To say that I'm happy with this tool is to say nothing. It's just awesome.

I was afraid at first that CO2 sensor is not showing good results (I have checked against verified Autopilot and CO2Meter devices), but it all went back to nominal when device self-calibration was over (there's a mark on the device homepage when calibration is in progress).

I also found sound meter extremely helpful in my measurements, because noise is one of the critical aspects of the vent system functioning.

It was also helpful that device stored data internally when the connection failed so I did not loose my measurement data for several days.

I found the web-interface a bit difficult to scroll for long periods of time, so more graphana-like interface is welcome. Yet at the moment it can be worked around by exporting the data in csv and importing it in any analytics tool.

I purchased an additional indoor module for my unattached heated garage.  The wind gauge is mounted at the highpoint on my house roof.

It’s winter here, but we have warm spell and supposed to get rain, so I’m excited to see the rain gauge work.  

I also own two Netatmo cameras:  Presence (mounted on my garage with motion detector flood light camera) and Welcome (interior camera with facial recognition).  Very happy with both products.

Set up easily and reports accurately and dependably. The apps are just OK.  If all you're interested in is looking at the data remotely the apps are fine.  However, if you'd like to look back at your data (highs and lows for instance), you have to find them in your graph or download data.  Also, the app is not very customizable.  You're stuck with RH, but can't look at dew point.  The color CO2 hazard indicator also takes up too much screen real estate.

It's great to have hyper-local data of the weather broadcasted to me every ten minutes! All of the features work great, although perhaps because of my location far under an overhang my weather station does not respond to sudden weather changes as fast as some other stations in the area.

It does have some issues, the major one for me is that the CO2 sensor always has shown 5000. When I actually tried to have it fixed, the warranty had expired, and it's $79 for another indoor module. I would have loved to know CO2 levels in my house... Another issue I was having for a long time was that it was having problems connecting to the wifi. However, when I moved it to a place where there was a door and a wall instead of two walls between it and the signal, it connected consistently. 

Also, in times of low humidity, it always reads a higher humidity then other stations. When most stations in the area were reading 4-7%, mine read 11%. The pressure readings were too high as well, but I found a solution. I subtracted 90 feet from my altitude in location settings, and it fixed the problem.

I also have gotten the rain gauge, and it works perfectly. I like the graphs that are provided as well, although with the new update they get annoyingly zoomed in every time I leave and come back. Overall though, it's a great weather station and perfect for weather watching.

Please read: Everyone, this app requires a weather station to work, and to calibrate your barometer change your stations altitude in settings - 9 ft is around 0.01 inches of mercury change. Add altitude to increase the readings and subtract altitude to decrease them.";"2015-06-24T08:00:31-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=532538499&type=Purple%20Software";"532538499";310;"en";"POSITIVE"
