Like many others, it takes me hours to get the speakers connected and to create a surround group. Then, for no apparent reason, both rear speakers disconnect from the WiFi (sometimes a couple of hours later) and it takes HOURS to get it to work again. So frustrating!

No, it shouldn't. You should/have buy/bought a Bluetooth speaker for that. And then u can easily enjoy your music in ultra-crappy low bandwidth/low quality in exchange for a simple direct connection that was designed for keyboards and headsets/headphones at best. Def not meant for hi quality speaker hardware like the omni. Its a total waste and akin to buying a 2 seat porsche coupe and removing the engine and replacing with 2 rows of bench seats and a battery pack. And telling porsche they should have made it more economical and family friendly.  Should have just bought a Prius or a minivan instead. Cheaper and designed for your needs and intents. 

The rest of us intentionally bought this instead, to hear our music in hi quality/hi bandwidth over wifi/network instead. 

Yes network audio is sometimes more work than it should be but good things and new tech both always require more time and energy to get right and perfect. 

BT is def welcome by me as an alternative for when wifi/LAN not available, but should not be the default/main form of connection. Not for these speakers anyway, they sound great especially in hi res mode. More power than u expect, much better than sonos play 1 and slightly better than heos 1

Add in the fact that the S2 can be had with a rechargeable battery and still cost less than the competition and u have a winner, ESPECIALLY if they continue to improve the music services/software/connectivity going forward";"2016-07-01T18:54:03-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=914497069&type=Purple%20Software";"914497069";264;"en";"POSITIVE"

As of recently, the app has Constant disconnects. Cannot stay connected to Spotify connect for more than 20 seconds, cuts out for 20, then connects another 20. Frustrating.

Overall I am pretty happy. However I only use it with Pandora and it works great. I have found that when my iPhone or my iPad has been on too long the app starts to skip. I reboot the iPhone or iPad and everything works fine. So the problem is with the iPhone or iPad not the Omni. 

My one complaint is that the application does not work with Amazon playlist. It is not a big problem because Pandora so good.

It is not very intuitive, and it is a bit disappointing to find out that whereas it works with Amazon Music, it will not play my digital versions of purchased music (i.e., Amazon gives free digital versions of CDs I buy). I can access pre-set playlists, but can't figure out how to access anything else, or music that is included in my Prime membership. 

In addition, it's mind-boggling that the system doesn't work with collections in Google Play either. However, it works fine with my music in iTunes.";"2016-12-26T12:17:45-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=914497069&type=Purple%20Software";"914497069";92;"en";"POSITIVE"

Instead of simply acting as an extension of your phone, the app forces you to choose from a selection of predetermined music choices. This limits what you can actually play through the speaker since you can't use a service like YouTube. A better version would just let you connect to the device through Bluetooth, therefore allowing you to play anything you wanted to.";"2016-07-02T13:51:24-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=914497069&type=Purple%20Software";"914497069";78;"en";"POSITIVE"
