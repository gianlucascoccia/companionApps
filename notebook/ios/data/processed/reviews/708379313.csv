Bose refused to address this issue. As expensive as their products are. They will not help. They expect me to buy all new speakers. Every speaker in my house and truck are Bose. So disappointed. They are way behind in technology.  I hope your speakers doesn’t become lost on THEIR network because THEIR speakers can’t remember where to connect, you will get to run through a long drawn out process which includes resetting WiFi and setting up the speaker all over again. I DO THIS 3 to 4 times a week. I’ve stopped expecting them to play when I want to hear music. Bose has dropped the ball. Think twice. Coming from a guy who pushed their product for sound quality for years, it’s sad to say that their app and “connectabily” are horrible!! They will not even play your Apple Music playlist so I hope you don’t subscribe because any music or playlist you’ve downloaded you won’t be hearing through THEIR speakers.

We purchased a Bose Wave SoundTouch and a Bose SoundTouch 300. This got us exactly what we wanted and they communicate over our wireless network so setup was really easy and fast. Bose does not do a good job of making it clear that these two products can work together. It is clearly stated that the Bose Wave SoundTouch works in conjunction with the Bose SoundTouch 10, 20, and 30, but not clear about the SoundTouch 300 sound bar, bass and rear speakers. Even the very unhelpful store employees told us that these products would not work together. I did some research online while in the store and came to the conclusion that the employees were wrong. We took the chance and bought both and am glad we did. They work perfectly together. We can play music in one room, watch TV in the other, stream the same music in both rooms, or different music in both rooms. The system is very flexible like that. The app is easy to use and works great. Sound quality is what you would expect from a product bearing the Bose name.

The ability to rebroadcast needs more work. I love this ability...if only it were better. I have 3 SoundTouch speakers. The only one that video syncs is the one physically connected to the video source (TV AUX out). But when I try to bring up the second then 3rd speaker, it rebroadcasts, but it drops. And when the drops stop, the audio is distractinglily delayed. It does say it's a beta version so hopefully Bose reads these. 
I went from a Logitech squeeze box network, to sound touch and I love it. Richer sound and It's more stable. Only one wish: can you do something about the preset memory buttons? There are only six. Why not allow the ability to save individually? Meaning I have 3 radios. Each have six presets. For those of use with more than one unit, why not allow me to combine them, that gives me presets for 18 stations! Logitech allows you to do that. But not Bose?

This system does not work with a mesh network. We accept this and have improvised. We have Google Fiber 1 gig. This many speakers (16) need an excellent signal. We have a dedicated router (non mesh) for the Bose system as well. The speakers also need a fast signal. We have the router separating 2.4ghz and 5ghz. We only use the 5ghz. A 5ghz signal, while much faster than 2.4 ghz, doesn’t travel as far as 2.4ghz. The system in our house needs the speed of 5ghz. While there is some fade at 1 outlying speaker, I love this system. It can be quirky. We’ve had this system for several years now. It has been frustrating (extremely) at times. I just had to accept that it WILL NOT WORK with our Orbi Network. It confuses the speaker system. I’ve had to work with this and have improvised as stated earlier. 

If you are willing to work with this system’s limitations, it can be wonderful. It’s taken me years to figure it out. I’m still learning and Bose continues to work on issues with the app. 

Bose customer service is excellent. Even when I’ve called in a bit grumpy, they really do care and want their customers to be happy with their products. They will do their best to find a solution.

It’s annoying having to scroll from songs with the number 1 all the way to the “Ms” just to get to an album that starts with the letter M. 

Secondly, the app splitting songs up based on whether or not there’s a featured artist on the song is irritating. I find a album after having to manually scroll thru all albums to get to it to only then find out that only 6 of the 13 songs are displayed because the other 7 have featured artist i.e.; I select Lloyd’s album “Tru” and only 4 songs display yet if I go back to the album selection page there’s 6 additional songs by Lloyd that appear such as; Lloyd [Featuring Rick Ross] that do not show up under the actual album “Tru” simply because there’s a featured artist on the actual song therefore I have to go back and forth to play the full album.

I wish I could say they are catching up and if you call Bose they will claim to have a “quality” software team.

The problem is not my Internet connection; I know that, because for years I have streamed the same station on my laptop, and I never had to deal with interruptions. Also... when I use the notebook version of the app, it often says, for no obvious reason, that my iTunes library isn't available, and the only solution is to shut down the app, shut down iTunes, and restart both. (And even then, sometimes the situation isn't resolved until I install whatever SoundTouch update just became available -- it seems every day there is a new one, as constant nagging messages remind me). Lastly, the app does not let you stream podcasts, which is a sad limitation for this type of app. If you want to listen to a podcast, you have to download it on your notebook or PC (not your phone..), add it to an iTunes playlist, and stream it from your iTunes library (which by the way, won't refresh while the app is running).

Re: Sound Touch.

I have every model in my home and feel that I could make a few user comment.

Model 10. I have a pair in my bedroom. I Listen to them every night and morning.  I decided recently that I wanted to play my flat screen tv through them.  Checking the owners manual I could find information on this setup.  Called the tech line and was told that to do so I would have to separate right and left and use the aux inputs.  Turns out that the 10's don't have a stereo function when in aux mode.  Operating the 10's as two separate speakers the remote tries to operate both.  I gave up. Mayhaps if I add Bluetooth to my my tv I could do it.

20's, 30's and Wave Clock Radio. Use them almost every day.

Main System: I have it connected to my Bose home theatre system.   The theater system has been tuned to the room using The provided computer balance system.  Room sounds great! 

Here's the rub,  the Sound Touch Main system favors the right channel and the home theater and the main unit offer no right / left balance. 

System:  all of my units occasionally drop out for a few seconds.  The interesting thing is that not all the systems fail at the same time.  I feel I have good internet service but the dropouts are annoying.

I will continue to favor Bose products.......Nothing better.";"2017-08-09T18:07:22-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=708379313&type=Purple%20Software";"708379313";265;"en";"POSITIVE"

Added functionality of being able to switch to Radio receiver and presets would be nice; why is this not present already? Intuitively it should be there.

My husband thought for the longest time that my problems were user error but now he’s witnessed it too. Most commonly the speakers will just quit playing but sometimes they’re more creative. One speaker out of six might randomly switch to another station. A speaker may be playing but not know that it is, so you can’t adjust the volume.

Further the soundtouch app seems to interfere with the wifi management on iOS as opening will sometimes cause the iOS device to lose its wifi connectivity causing multiple error messages within the app.
Bose support is generally not reachable and when they are they also tend to be quite defensive and try to push back the blame on the user system rather than really help to solve the problem.

If you lose the remote you are stuck with the AirPlay or Bluetooth source unless you buy their $50 remote.

We stayed in the Bose family as it seemed unlikely we could easily integrate a different device. Bought a Soundtouch 10 for the kitchen. Oops.

Sometimes I lose control of one device & sometimes both. The 10 drops out for 5 seconds every 15 to 40 minutes for no apparent reason. If I use the handheld for volume it seems the app gives up and only a restart allows volume control from the app.

Very friendly tech support people have walked me through the a purge & reprogram process (about 30 minutes).

First issue is that all the time the app needs an update and all the speakers need an update. This takes 20 minutes for each speaker, so should you decide to turn your music on for a dinner party, it will be cold by the time you are done doing this update procedure. I think I own 5 of these nose speakers for about 2 years now and I have updated them more than 30 times.

This is really annoying because this seems to be my total user experience. The updates are not optional. You have to update before anything plays. Very often I just give up now because it just seems like Bose can never get their app to be sufficient quality that an update becomes “optional”

Well, then when it is finally updated, sometimes it works , sometimes it does not. Depends on what settings got lost during the update (I have had to regroup the speaker groups a dozen times ). Depends on whatever else . Time of the day, weather? They are on a wired network so it has no Wi-Fi excuses.

Speakers drop out regularly and it is not clear at all how to get back on to play

However in July 2018 the speakers were unable to connect to play any of my itunes music or any music on my apple devices. I was very frustrated after spending $599 for the Soundtouch III System. I was on the phone hours with a technician and it still did not work. I was through with Bose at that point and felt like I had wasted on $599. I wanted to sell the system on Ebay but was not sure if it was broken or not. But once  apple launched the ios12 update, Bose updated the speakers and they finally work after 4 months of no music.

After reading up on similar speakers, I narrowed down my options to Sonos and Bose. Sonos boasts integrated Alexa functionality but we aren’t big Google/Amazon ecosystem users at home. Even so, I imagine that integrated feature can be very convenient.

Coupled with Bluetooth, the Wi-Fi capability was a big selling point. At the price of these and similar speakers, I imagine a lot of folks are looking at audio fidelity. I was pretty surprised at the augmented quality playing audio through Wi-Fi versus Bluetooth. Having both connectivity options will definitely come in handy.

 Very happy with this purchase. I opted for two speakers so the stereo field is a truly pleasant listening experience.

Last, I am a huge fan of the tactile buttons as another control option. While I’ll probably do most of the controlling via phone/app, I can appreciate the availability and superior quality of the buttons on the speakers.

Connectivity needs improvement however. I am tech savvy but this thing is a pain to setup and often does not connect to a source on the first or even the second try.

The app is not revolutionary, but it gets the job done. It makes the setup a bit easier. You set a preset by dragging & dropping a station to one of the preset numbers. Those numbers match the hardware buttons on the unit. 

I have had some of the same issues that other users have reported where occasionally I'll start the app on my iPhone 6S & it'll say it can't find the stereo, even though both my phone & the stereo are connected via the same wifi network. I've tested this extensively by turning off the cell phone radio on my phone, only having wifi enabled, confirming I can surf the Internet, while music is playing on the stereo. It seems that when my phone has issues finding the stereo, my wife's iPhone7 doesn't have any issues connecting.

The app is glitchy. The volume control is not smooth. At times it reads quieter or louder than it actually is. Sometimes when you’re using it, it will suddenly take on a mind of its own and start increasing the volume without your permission. It will continue to do this, getting louder and louder unless you close the app and relaunch it. 

The speakers frequently (2-3x/week) become disconnected from the app and have to be reset by unplugging them. 

Lastly, the Soundlink feature for Bluetooth and Aux input playback creates a 3 second delay, making it impossible to use with any form of video. This was one of the big reasons we purchased these speakers rather than the Sonos, since we can theoretically use them when we watch a movie on the computer. We found a workaround that isn’t ideal as we lose the stereo effect, but it involves an aux cable splitter. 

All that to be said, it’s really confusing and disappointing that Bose would put out such great sounding speakers that are glitchy.

The only reason that I am writing this review is that it needs some fixing and improvement.

Fixing:  When I first purchased a Soundtouch unit, this software use to show the metadata (song information) when playing a SiriusXM station.  It no longer does so.  Every other SiriusXM app/device displays the music info, but not Soundtouch.  This needs to be brought back.

Improvement:  Apple Music and iTunes Match music uploaded to  iCloud need to be added as a service.  I do know that Apple is highly proprietary, and they do have their own speaker/home device; maybe that is why they don’t contract with Bose.  But my feeling is that it could be a win/win situation for both companies and the customer.  I’ve held off subscribing to Apple Music for this very reason.

Most of the time, either the speakers wont connect to the internet and/or the app wont connect to the speakers.  

The most reliable, but not guaranteed, way to fix the connection problems is to hard power cycle (ie pull the plug) the speakers and/or to go into the speaker setup and chose the “connect speaker > wifi” options.  You can hit cancel after a couple seconds and like magic, most of the time the app will find the speakers.  

This tells me that the app is poorly written and doesn’t handle reconnection issues well.

Once again, Bose leads the league is fantastic speakers and completely fails at everything else.
