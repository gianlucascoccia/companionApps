When trying to pair, there was constant static/disconnect rendering them unusable. JBL responded that only one speaker can be connected to your phone‚Äôs Bluetooth and the other connects through the app to the other speaker. I can listen with party boost or stereo modes easily. The one issue is that once I set up which mode I want, I cannot open the app and easily change between the modes. It wants you to reconnect the speakers, essentially start over.

But I admit, It‚Äôs hard to know where the problem exists, is it the app or the speakers?  However, after reading a large number of other reviews, it appears that there are problems using the app with many of the various speaker types that it supports.  I have two Pulse 3 speakers and it is almost impossible to get them working in stereo mode.  There is nothing about setting this up in the printed manual that comes with the speakers so I assume it is limited to setup via the app.  Also I can sometimes get one of the speakers set up to adjust the display but never so that I can adjust the other without without disconnecting both from Bluetooth first.  When I go to the Bluetooth setup on my iPhone to disconnect, I find two instances of one of the two speakers listed.  What is with that?

I bought two Charge 4s to listen in a stereo pair. Getting them to do that is nigh impossible. The app has been like this for a year now and nobody at Harman seems to want to fix it.  Just read the reviews in chronological order - recent first. 

My advice would be to stay away from JBL‚Äôs speakers, nifty-looking though they are until they fix the app.  Maybe it can‚Äôt be fixed.

If your goal is to set a pair of speakers permanently or semi-permanently into a stereo configuration then expect to be disappointed: the speakers don‚Äôt stay in the last configuration through power cycles. 

Even more frustrating the app doesn‚Äôt remember the state of the speakers: for example, the speakers will be in stereo mode from the last time they were set, but the app will force you to reconnect and reset the speakers to work with them again. 

The Charge 4 speakers, only one should be paired to your device. Nothing works if both are paired and connectedüôÅ. 

The app often thinks another copy of the app is running on a different device, even when no other devices are present. 

Unnecessary requests for confirmation from the app, are tedious, the infamous ‚Äògot it‚Äô button. The app does have difficulty connecting many times when trying to use a speaker not paired as a stereo speaker or party speaker. It will tell you to bring the device closer to the speaker when it is literally less than 2 inches away. I am not sure why the connectivity issues are so ubiquitous. I am sure that there is more that can be done within the Bluetooth protocol API to make use of these friendlier. The user interface of the app is really atrocious. It would be nice for the app to honor dark mode option of iOS. But there is so much more wrong than that I hardly know where to start.  It would be great if they would add a feature that would allow you to use a previous configuration with one tap on the button, and to try over and over again behind the scenes to set things up that way, letting you know it‚Äôs trying, rather than forcing the user to try over and over and over again until it finally works, which it will, but it takes a frustrating amount of time frequently. This should be done by the processor not the user. When the music is paused, no matter how briefly, the speaker controlled by the app (not paired) to be in stereo mode will not play music for 10 to 15 seconds. You will get only one channel being played until it sort of wakes up again and realizes it should be acting as the left/ right channel. It would be great to have a persistent configuration option. So that when the speakers are both turned on they automatically go to a stereo configuration, in my case I would ask for the blue speaker to always be the right channel and the teal speaker to always be the left channel and not to have to mess with it every single time I turn them on.  The application really needs to have some semblance of state and to try to work out the connectivity issues on its own before bothering the user. That it assumes another app is involved when there is no such thing happening it‚Äôs quite frustrating.

The first step was to update the software on both of them (one at a time) using this app and connecting the speaker to a power source. When paired with each other using this app it worked well enough (it even differentiated the speakers based on their actual color), though any kind of volume change would cause one speaker to cut in and out for 10 to 20 seconds until it ""caught up."" I'm not sure if this is because the phone is connected to only one of the speakers and then that speaker is connected to the other speaker, or perhaps it could also be the phone is connected to both speakers at once and the bluetooth signal isn't quite strong enough. Either way, there is a lag time for any volume inputs that *would* be slightly annoying in a party setting. Once ""caught up"" though, it worked well. It seemed the max distance for the phone from the speakers was cut way down when paired with both. I would recommend having the phone somewhere between them.

The app makes switching between light shows and adjusting brightness a breeze. I keep it at full brightness during the day and dim it at night. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because  I wish there was a way to turn the device On and Off from the app. Also, when scrolling through the different light shows, there should be an option to turn the lights Off, but there isn‚Äôt.

The app will not even show you anything connected, since the last update I cannot even see the speakers despite multiple devices connected, iPad, iPhone etc. I cannot get them into stereo mode because by default they are put into mono or ‚Äúparty‚Äù mode.

All flash, little functionality, and mystery meat navigation. New rule: Every product manager should be forced to 5-10 years experience ‚Äúusing apps‚Äù before being allowed to design one!

Here‚Äôs what you can do:

1. Upgrade the firmware on your speaker. Though many have complained of having difficulty, I had no issue. Just follow the instructions. Make sure you don‚Äôt have any communication interference. Note once you  update, no discernible way to go back .

2. Connect one or more of these in party mode or stereo. I only have one so I did not test that.

3. Change the name of your device. Very unintuitive. There is no obvious confirm button and I had to try it several times. I finally just left it on the screen where you edit the name and after a while it appeared to change by itself. Weird. FYI: to change the name you press the little gear icon on bottom of screen, then the little pencil and paper icon next to the default, then type over the default. Obvious....not!

It‚Äôd be nice to be able to enter a passcode or have an equalizer or even simple bass/treble controls. Something. But alas this is just taking up 65MB on my phone that is begging  to be deleted.

My main complaint comes with the lights. The whole reason I bought it was because a friend of mine had the original pulse. The connect app that comes with that one has way cooler light effects built in. The are more active and interesting to look at. I also liked the ability to choose the color from within the app. Please give us some cooler effects to use with the pulse 2! Bring back the original equalizer and even some of the other lighting effects from the original pulse. I would love he speaker even more than I already do. 

The only other thing I would add is that I wish you could turn off the lights from within the JBL connect app as well. Sometimes I'm laying in bed listening to music and enjoying the show and I don't want to get up and turn the thing off. It would even be cool if you could add a feature where the speaker turns off after 30 minutes of inactivity, like the original!

Other than those few pieces of feedback, I'd say the speaker and app work well together. I don't have any issues connecting and the app is easy to navigate.

Now I tested it My Charge 3 with my JBL Boombox, the Boombox being Connect+ enabled by Default I listened to a couple of tracks, I Right away noticed drop outs (Constantly) Which I guess is because of the software update, & or just not having 2 of the same speakers (2x JBL Boombox 2x JBL Charge 3)
Which shouldn‚Äôt make a difference when you‚Äôre going to add more units along the way.

Time to time I use both speakers in party mode, Which sounds good, but the delay in when you play (Any media content) takes time for the other speaker which is not the Master to come in to (Sync)

Overall if I am going to purchase more JBL Connect+ enable speakers, JBL needs to come out with an software update to JBL Connect+ to fix these Minor issues.

Also an update for previous Connect Enabled speakers to be upgraded to Connect+

Mids & highs were great too. NOT NOW!!! Big business & technology just screws over the freaking product like the tech is the most important part! This is a $300 piece of crap now! I better shut up or JBL will make me pay 3 figures for the tech. Back in the days of analog, & early digital, stereos did what the customer who purchased it wanted. This is a first!!

Now the speaker does NOT hold the sound at higher levels. The bass NOW sounds like a muffled dead thud. Like it's not a part of the song. Like it's in a sealed aquarium then set out in the hallway away from the rest of the song. Terrible!

on top of that, JBL will not allow you to connect to older generation speakers... and it‚Äôs not like you can argue the reason for this is the Pulse 4 just hit the market, because it‚Äôs been out for a while.

While this app is cool when it's not crashing it's completely inconvenient. My number one issue is the shade and color adjuster where did it go?? While snapshot is cool but just not practical I have yet to get any shade of purple and In addition to that I have to dig through my closet for colors it's ridiculous (pink) for instance if I'm going out to a bonfire for this October do you think there are going to be pink and blue colors for me to grab ???? 

Then second the light modes are so boring yeah it's cool that you can interact change the patten of fireflies but unless your consistently interacting with it the light shows are actually boring and static but at least we can control the intensity. 

Then finally what happened to the equalizer and club mode that interacted directly with source of sound?? Those were my favorite features of the old one!! Bring this back!! bring back the color and shader to the app!! 

I'm returning the pulse 2, I will consider upgrading once they have addressed these issues. What I can say positively is that it's splash proof and has better lighting.

When in stereo mode the speakers independently lose and regain signal every few minutes to the point that the mode is unusable. This is especially frustrating because I did get it to work once and they sounded nice.

Please get out of the professional lighting industry and concentrate on home entertainment. I purchased the Extreme and the Flip 3 which are incredible for what they are.

Also, you can have Stereo with 2 speakers only. If you have 3 or more, it changes to Mono.

Example use I‚Äôd like: two Charge‚Äôs as left and right stereo...with Xtreme as your sub would be easy and make this an amazing setup and selling point. Or, if you could do 2 pairs on each channel, I‚Äôd buy more speakers! ...should the sales team tell this to the app developer?!?!

It's a pretty awesome speaker, my disappointment comes from the lack of EQ sync feature. The light modes are good and pretty but they, in no way, sync with the music.
