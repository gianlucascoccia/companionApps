However if you want to add a timer, neither the start time or the end Time was able to save. You can choose hour, minutes, and am/pm, then no way the time I selected would stick. This must be a bug. If they fix this problem, I will change my rating to 5-star.

Good on them for fixing it quickly.  Hopefully there will be better quality control on updates in the future.

Updated from 2.8.0 to 2.8.1 on iphone. “Device does not exist” error appears.  Older iphone with 2.8.0 works fine.  Tried resetting, AP mode, adding device, etc to no avail.  DO NOT INSTALL 2.8.1.  Hopefully this ridiculous new bug will be fixed soon.  Meanwhile all devices with the upgrade are essentially bricked as remotes now.

I first downloaded the e-Control app per the BroadLink instruction manual. After about an hour of tweaking and wrestling with the very unintuitive interface in that app, I managed to get the app controlling both devices. Unfortunately when I went to set up the Alexa skill, the instructions there stated that “the previous version of the app is not supported” and to download the IHC app.
After downloading this app and resetting the RM mini 3 device, the app fails to connect to it. This feels like a very broken ecosystem and a shoddy product.

It has so much potential that may be going to waste. The developers need to pour time and money into this app. Here are my suggestions:
Optimize it for iPhone 6/6+ and iPad screens. Make it smoother and more appealing to the eyes. Get rid of the Chinese writing, fix the Temperature display, (the Celsius and Fahrenheit readings mix up). Make the storage bigger per ""remote"" ( I love having combo buttons but it maxes out at only 900bytes). Also make it so it doesn't sign my profile out every couple days. Apple is opening up HomeKit and Siri to developers now, so the new app could have extra functionality as well (imagine being able to control it all with your voice through Siri) If you fixed all these things, more people would buy the product and the company as a whole could do much better (I personally would get multiple more RM Pros if the app was better, and I know other people that would too).";"2016-07-25T08:38:19-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=793152994&type=Purple%20Software";"793152994";174;"en";"POSITIVE"

1.Accessing the hardware over cellular does not work, which makes this useless until you are either at home or work. If you're getting this to control lights, AC etc while you are on the go, that part is broken and has been for months now.

2.Also, control of the A1 sensor is practically useless. Even if you can set up some 'interactions' ( IFTT style recipes) that work initially, it is very limited in how that can be done, and they all stop working within a week. As it is now, the A1 makes an unattractive paper weight.

3. The interactions are unable to trigger scene modes on the rm2 for some reason, severely limiting what it can do in the first place. As it is now, each conditional statement can trigger only one remote button, and I think you are limited to 9 recipes total. So much unrealized potential on this...

Please address these issues so I people can actually use the hardware they paid for.  Get the basics working before investing all this time and effort into Alexa integration, which is useless when the initial product is so limited.";"2017-07-19T09:39:23-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=793152994&type=Purple%20Software";"793152994";202;"en";"NEGATIVE"

This is your third update and still not working with WiFi 
Do you guys actually try to fix the problems people report?
I feel like I purchased some smart plugs that became dummy plugs because no longer work away from home or without WiFi. 
-    -    -   -   

Still not working after the last 2 updates. 
It used to work fine away from home without wifi, but it not longer work anymore, so it became useless. 
Please fix it. 
I allready reset it and reinstall it but nothing work without WiFi. 
If you are reading this to control something away from home, make sure somebody wrote that this problem it's been fixed before you purchase any device.";"2017-10-02T21:34:47-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=793152994&type=Purple%20Software";"793152994";118;"en";"NEGATIVE"
