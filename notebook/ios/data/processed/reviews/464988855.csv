First, it was very easy to install. The instructions are easy to follow; I did not have to do any rework. I did not have to hire a professional. Programming the controls was also easy with step by step instructions. I like the fact that it self programs economic settings based on when you’re home. I’m single and working so it’s nice to know it is saving me money by reducing back the heating and cooling temps when I’m not home. And it does it automatically through a sensor that detects motion. This could, however, be a problem if you have a big dog. You can also control the settings using your smart phone, which is what I do pretty much all the time. I can even control it from work and by using Google voice. This system requires a dependable WiFi. If the WiFi goes off line, however, as it has done with me a few times, the system will still function but you won’t be able to control it from you smart phone. Once the WiFi is back on line, the thermostat will automatically resume previous settings. And best of all, it has saved me hundreds of dollars in utility savings. And it looks sharp on the wall. Well worth the money, and so easy for DIY’ers. Definitely worth a five-state rating!!";"2021-10-23T05:20:31-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=464988855&type=Purple%20Software";"464988855";242;"en";"POSITIVE"

Luckily I got them at Costco!  Costco returned them with no issues, and they also happened to have Nest thermostats available too.  So I got a full refund for the old thermostats, and bought two new Nest Version 3 thermostats (as my house is divided into two areas).  Replacing the first thermostat took a little longer than the second, as it was just getting to know how the unit works and confirming the wire schematic.  The first unit connected to my router with no problems, but the second one kept failing at first.  I ended up temporarily moving the second unit to the first unit’s location and got it to connect.  After I moved it back to its correct location, it was still connecting ok.  

The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars was that the actual application kept disconnecting after both thermostats were connected, and several times during installation.  It’s almost like it reset, and you’d have to start the install from the beginning again with the Nest app.";"2020-04-17T11:53:04-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=464988855&type=Purple%20Software";"464988855";198;"en";"NEGATIVE"

However, I have the Nest E and I wish that there was a temperature hold feature for this or something similar to that. I have attempted to troubleshoot this problem by clearing out The schedule and setting it two times but it always reverts back to Eco or the temperature goes up. I work nights which means I sleep during the day and since I live in a hot dry air and state waking up at 1300 hrs drenched in sweat because The thermostat and the app didn’t talk to each other showing my location and the thermostat were in the same place; the schedule that I set up wasn’t followed; or the fact that the thermostat did not detect any motion for an extended period of time. Not only is this a problem when I am sleeping on my work days as a nurse, but it’s also a problem on my off days when I just want to spend the morning in bed and after six or 7 AM it throws the temperature up to 86°.
Google developers I know you can fix this and I hope you can even if it means downloading firmware to help and upgrading the app. I also know that these are changing times and more people are at home so even more now than ever the thermostat doesn’t know what the hell it’s doing because we are all home now.

It has such a high latency rate - you open the app and it takes 45 seconds to load up to the main menu. (It’s not my wifi or cellular connection) So let’s consider this: your doorbell rings. You open the app, wait 45 seconds, then navigate to the doorbell where you can access the microphone and begin talking. At that point, the interaction time has been about 55 seconds. Most people, after ringing a doorbell, won’t stay at the door that long, thus by the time I can finally get to the mic the person is gone and the feature is no longer useful. Additionally, it’s a pain to guard nest guard with the app. I’ll tap the shield and it will load for 30 seconds and then say it can’t connect. I do it again. Can’t connect. After 5 or 6 times it will FINALLY arm the system. A last complaint I have is that nest is no longer integrated with HomeKit. It was previously before the company was purchased by Google. I get that Google instead wants you to use the Google home system however, as an avid Apple user, it’s frustrating to have to use 2 systems. We chose Nest because the physical products are far beyond the competition but there are some serious rooms for improvement for this application. Reduce network calls on app launch, considering auditing latency for the app and see where the problem lies, and please integrate with HomeKit.";"2020-10-17T06:18:33-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=464988855&type=Purple%20Software";"464988855";260;"en";"NEGATIVE"

I'm sure I've already saved money, because the learning function has already made it WAY easier to maintain a comfortable temperature, and I don't forget that I have the AC or heat on, and overshoot a comfortable temperature.  I was really impressed how quickly it learned my habits, and began preempting my changes, so I find I'm quickly losing the habit of constantly thinking about the temperature, and I haven't found  myself uncomfortable enough to be reminded since about day 2. It's really cool to be able to control it from my phone, but I find the more technical controls useful, and the data it records and aggregates is just as interesting and useful. I know this is supposed to be a review for the app, not the thermostat, but it's really just an aspect of the same product, so I believe it's relevant.

I have enjoyed being able to monitor and manage the temperatures at each home at any time. I have not found the Protect product as useful. I went all in a brought 5 Protects and found them to be supper expensive and annoying to maintain. After about 6-8 years Nest will send you a notice that you Protect will no longer work and you have to replace it with a new. The other annoyance it takes allot of batteries 6-8 that don’t last that long. It test it self once a month which is annoying and create a lot of unnecessary messages and disruption. Given the cost of batteries and the device and frequent messages I have decide not to replace theProtect as they obsolete. I will just replace them with stand alone 10 year maintenance free devices and save a fair amount of money and aggravation. When I started with nest they were just Nest but now that Google owns them ever time I sign it to maintain my device Google wants me to switch over to my Google account to manage them. I use a lot of Google products but at some point I want to restrict how much info they have on me so I keep saying no I don’t want to switch to Google.

i have not had an issue since then. the cameras were a lifesaver!
on another occasion, my mailbox had been hit, so i just scrolled back through the video & there it was. a landscaping truck had taken it out. i simply called the company, forwarded the video & they replaced my mailbox.

The costumer service is below average the take turn transferring you to the next person that can not help you. Defiantly a product to avoid. There are other cameras out there for cheaper.

Somehow Nest consistently releases bugs and the app gets worse every time I use it. At this point scrubbing through video streams is completely unusable. It glitches and jumps and freezes so much while trying to scrub that it becomes so irritating that I just give up. What’s strange is that it used to work just fine, some how they totally messed it up. Not only that but they actually accidentally removed the button to be able to switch between events and the ability to scrub through the video feed. The button was still there just didn’t have an icon so you could still activate it for a while.

For the record, I have four nest cameras, a doorbell, thermostat, the security system and two smoke detectors. I also pay for the subscription monthly. 

I also understand it might be hard having employees work from home and that updates might be tough but honestly it’s almost as if there is no quality assurance whatsoever.

The nest thermostat can run the fan by itself, but when doing so it must be in heating or cooling mode.  In spring, I like to circulate cool air from the basement through the house.  I also like to leave windows open for fresh air, and circulate that air too.  There are days where it’s 80* during the day and 50* at night.  These are perfect days to leave windows open and periodically run the fan.  However, for this to work with the nest, I have to set the cooling mode on and use a cooling set point above 80* to make sure the air conditioning isn’t coming on wastefully while windows are open.  It’s not the end of the world, but an item that I believe should be simple functionality that would bring me to like the product better.

-well built.  
-easy to install
-built in lithium ion battery backup
-Geofencing.
-runs fan after the heat turns off for a couple minutes to get the rest of the heat out of the ductwork instead of heating the walls.
-seems to connect well on both 2.4 and 5 G networks.
- the app does well at showing the thermostat wire connections.

Cons
-does not work with Apple home kit which would put the Thermostat control right in the control center of the iPhone.   I am hoping they add this in a future update!
-no geofencing range limit that can be set.  Not sure what range it is using.  It would be great to at least know.
-requires all home members who want to use geofencing (home/away) feature to have separate google accounts. 
-does seem to always recognize when I come home and doesn’t switch from Away to Home mode.
-cannot set the cycle rate so the temps fluctuate way to much.  I am guessing the different is about 2 or 3 degrees.  This maintenance band is too wide.
-both on the app and the thermostat it’s hard to know what temperatures you are looking at, is it the actual temperature or set point.  Especially around the dial, it just uses points and does not list out the actual temperature.  Very annoying.  I don’t want to have to add up 1/2 degree tick marks.  Include some numbers already.

In setting I think if they used inside the Nest aware tab maybe manage subscriptions, help, etc? Might be useful other than seeing what nest aware can do. Also there is a nest aware plus, I don’t believe it’s shown what’s the difference inside the app either which could be nice. These features I feel are important so having better usability would be appreciated!

Connectivity issues on the devices themselves (both newer and older devices) and connectivity/playback issues in the app no matter what router/cell coverage and internet speeds we have. Often the skip forward/back 15 seconds takes longer than 15 seconds to even load, so often it is useless to try to skip forward. No real useful updates or improvements made to the app in who knows how long (how about a pause playback button or better clip making features both of which are available just through web browsers?!). I know Google has been known to drive products/services they purchase into the ground but was hoping maybe Nest would be the exception since they seemed to be pretty hands-off for a long time.

The support of the sensors is done like a patch (when you are able to add them…in my old apartment I had a ticket open for 3 months before getting it fixed and being able to add them), meaning that is not properly designed and integrated. You can see the temperatures of the different sensors but you can only set one sensor to trigger the AC manually or based on only 4 time slots of the day, regardless of the day of the week, which is a big limitation. Should it be clever enough to calculate the average of the temperature of all the sensors of the house and use it to set the temperature or the average of specific sensors? Yes, it should…but it doesn’t!! What a big disappointment.
Last: there is no “snooze” / pause button if you want to temporarily stop the air from blowing : you have to change the temperature to do that and then change again when you want it to start again.

I also found it impossible to get three thermostats to connect. They seem to connect on their own mesh network and so even if you have strong WiFi the devices may not all register and see each other. I had to fake a second house to get the one in my basement to work at all. It’s fine, but it’s not connected to the other two sensors and it seems that’s part of the benefit as they are supposed to work together. 

One final point. If your electric goes out, you have a 1-2 hour back up battery. After that you have no heat. I have not tested this but thats important to know if you are dealing with heavy winter storms. I was surprised that the back up battery was not of longer duration. Seems like an easy solve. 
I would recommend keeping either your old thermostats in case you need them in an emergency or having some way to charge the nest faceplate if you had to. (There is a USB port but haven’t tested that and again you will take an hour or three to charge it for an hour or two of use.

We figured probably not, but we installed them anyway. 

This holiday season, we were 900 miles away - certainly not thinking of home. At church, I went to silence my phone & noticed a Nest alert that there was smoke detected in our home. Surprisingly calm, I called our local fire dispatch & contacted neighbors and family. By the time the fire department arrived, smoke filled our home. The cause: an overheated furnace! 

Our home was likely saved because of that Nest alert. We can deal with minor smoke damage! That decision to buy a Nest product made all the difference in the world.

I also love that I can control the Nest from my phone. If I’m in bed and want the temp moved up or down you grab your phone and change it.

I can set a schedule and within seconds, go back to it and find that Nest has changed that schedule, sometimes drastically.

Now for the actual Nest thermostat itself. The device looks pretty, but smart would not be amongst the words I would use to describe it. Once it latches on to a setting (“learns it”) it is almost impossible to change the setting. If it wants to set the temp to 70, and you feel like you want to change it, it will change it back. You can’t turn off the smarts completely. You have to reset it completely to get rid of what it has learned, but then it will learn again and you will be in the same place.

When u have two thermostats , ie one upstairs and one downstairs you should be able to see temperature for both at the same time. This app makes you click too left corner to then click again to choose which thermostat to view to see temp and then click to adjust. The circles (both) that show thermostats should ALWAYS appear on screen when you log into app so you can quickly see temp and change if desired. Also when looking at schedule it would be nice to have the time stamps fonts bigger. Hard to see small type especially at night.

But seeing how you can't separate the device from the app, there is some crossover.

It was ""the first"" and it's been a consistent performer. I haven't looked into the EcoBee enough to know if it can perform a few things better but here goes.

The good is that it does learn and does keep track fairly well of what we like. But I feel the bad are so easy to change I just don't know why Google doesn't.

I have a two story house, the front faces directly east towards sunshine. The Nest is in the shade on an upstairs wall and I have a Nest temperature sensor downstairs. Like most houses, my upstairs becomes a furnace while my downstairs is a freezer.

The first problem is that for scheduling which sensor I want the app to use, the times are not adjustable. Meaning for most of the day I want the downstairs sensor to keep the downstairs more comfortable as that's where we spend our time but we put the kids to bed upstairs at 8pm and the app won't let me switch to use the upstairs sensor until 9pm. Why does scheduling have to be in blocks that Nest forces?

The second problem is that setting the sensor to Away or back to Home when we leave for vacation never stays set. Twice now I've set the thermostat to turn back on because we are headed home only to realize the app changed back to Away once I closed it. We've resorted to keeping the app open or checking constantly to make sure the temp. gets back to normal.";"2020-04-02T07:18:00-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=464988855&type=Purple%20Software";"464988855";278;"en";"POSITIVE"

The Nest app is now the painfully slow app and it seems Ring updated their app and it is now quick and highly responsive... So much so that when deciding which company to use for home security I went with Ring because the app is just that much quicker to react. In its current state I do not recommend this app and thus unfortunately can not recommend Nest products because this is a security issue and the faster the response the sooner you can deal with any issues/threats/what-not.

I specifically purchased the camera to check in on my senior bulldog. While on a trip across the country she passed out while her pet sitter was feeding her. She immediately stood up finished eating and went for a walk, making the pet sitter feel comfortable enough to leave her but worried enough to call me. I immediately reviewed the camera and it was clear to me it was a heart arrhythmia episode, panicked I called a friend and asked her to rush my bulldog to the emergency vet.

Overall, very nice thermostats. They secure to their base a little differently than other tstats, so it would be nice if Google included paper instructions. 
I love that you can set the stat to a schedule that fits any lifestyle. Way to go, Google. It is a bit weird that there is a function to copy and paste a weekly schedule, but not the daily schedule. It would also be nice to have the option of entering a schedule for a day and then applying it to all weekdays or to every day. 
I use the fan scheduling feature, but it is slow to respond. Scrolling through the times is a pain. Hey Google, at least add the option to switch from AM to PM without having to scroll through 13 hours of times to get to the end time you want. 
I don’t like Google’s privacy policy and practices. The thermostat only learns if you are home or away by tracking your phone. To work right, Google will track all your household members’ phones to know when everyone is away.

There is one aspect that will significantly improve the performance and that is related to the control logic. When I set the upper and lower temperature control values, I notice that the Nest controller does not actually control to these temperature settings. The Nest controller actually allows the actual temperature to go higher than the maximum temperature (by about one degree F) before it sends the signal to the air conditioner to turn on. It also allows the actual temperature to go lower than the minimum temperature (about one degree F) before sending the signal to the heater to turn on. This situation is quite annoying and I find that I have to manually adjust the temperature settings in order to turn on my HVAC System. I even looked through the settings to see if there is an adjustment I can make to the tolerance in the control logic but could not find such a function. 

I understand that there may need to be a lag in order to ensure the A/C or heater is not cycling on and off too quickly in order to protect my HVAC System, but the situation I am experiencing is not a rapid on or off situation that would damage my unit.

There’s no release notes for firmware updates in the app or online, and they happen silently. This means I can’t check to see if a recent update may be causing issues.

The worst issue is that currently very obvious motion events intermittently aren’t even recorded on the timeline at all. A person leaving the front door, the entire car leaving the driveway, people walking up to the front door. I cannot trust the camera anymore, the one thing that sold me on Nest in the first place.

I don’t have much issue with the thermostat itself, it’s about as straightforward as any non-smart thermostat, the problem is the unintuitive dumpster fire that is the app. 

To be fair, the main problem is the scheduling section, but since that is literally THE most important function of the app, I don’t feel too bad calling the whole thing a failure. 

The schedule section has no instructions, no tooltips, and is unintuitive. It has buttons that are apparently useless, or if they do do something, then they’re missing stuff. I’m talking about the ‘copy week’ button. What weeks? There is no month view, there is no ‘next week’ or ‘previous week’ button, there is no ‘make this the default’ option. So when I go through and individually set every temperature (a process just begging for some sort of convenience feature), I am rewarded by having it completely garbled the following week when for some reason the app tries to merge my changes with what it thought that next week should be, resulting in 30 minute windows of the temperature I actually wanted. And of course there’s no option to turn off the schedule feature and just leave it at a set manual temperature. 

I bought this house with a Nest already in it, and I will be removing it in favor of a competitor that has some semblance of quality control in their interface design.";"2019-12-02T08:13:37-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=464988855&type=Purple%20Software";"464988855";254;"en";"NEGATIVE"

An easy way to reproduce a similar issue is to disconnect a camera for a few minutes and then later try and scroll to that time.

In my case, however, my cameras are recording just fine and it still kicks me out with the same error.

I quickly learned to turn off the auto learning because all it does is track the time and temperature you're setting. That's good enough in winter but in summer it's different. When it's hot and dry I can easily take 80F in the house during the daytime. When it's hot and humid I need 77F. The thermostat never learns this - it just doesn't take the humidity level into account. That's not ""Smart"" in my opinion.

There's also no way to manually adjust the cool to dry feature's humidity level. I'd like to have it at 70% max. That's not possible, so I keep adjusting the thermostat manually, setting it to 77F, then back to 78F a little later because it runs too long. 

At other times, it's clearly above my desired temperature and the thermostat just doesn't feel like it's necessary to run the AC.

As countless others have mentioned, the app has connection problems. It's either super slow, shows the thermostat as offline, or does nothing. It's been like that for all the years we've had the thermostat. Absurd.

All of these problems have persisted over the years.

The Home/Away Assist feature is frustratingly unreliable. There are two of us in the household, each of us using our own Google ID to log into Nest and set up Home/Away assist. Every few days, one of us gets randomly logged out of Nest, even though we keep the app always running. The Nest can’t figure out if anyone is home or not. I then have to go into the app to manually set the status or turn a camera on or off. Sometimes I have to drill down deep in the settings to determine if it’s logged in or not, even as the app cheerfully streams live video. I have to look for a little yellow exclamation mark and the message that “we haven’t heard from your phone in awhile.” (The phone has been literally running the app continuously!)

Then after logging in, Nest acts like we’ve never logged in before, asks everything about using the Google ID and setting up Home/Away for the same user that was previously logged in.

Finally, you can’t change the tone used for notifications from the iPhone default, which is ridiculous.

The scheduling however is pretty poor and the reason it loses a star.

Since my nest is in a room we rarely walk through it loves to turn itself off and I either have to check on it every 2 hours or wait until the house is stifiling hot or freezing cold to realize it has gone 5-8 degrees off the temperature I had it set at.
The app solves all of this! Granted I have to log in on my phone every 2 hours, but it actually keeps my house more on track. 
That was until it logged me out and as many times as I have tried to log in then requested a new password when the log in doesn't work, the email never comes and there is not a support option in the app if it won't log you back in. 
So awesome first week and now completely useless. 
I may be better off chucking the whole Nest and just getting a thermostat that actually keeps the house a steady temperature.";"2021-06-27T19:04:18-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=464988855&type=Purple%20Software";"464988855";170;"en";"POSITIVE"

Additionally, the face recognition is useless as well. Saved faces are not recognized and faces are pulled from shapes in tree branches. 

As far as the thermostat... it takes on a mind of its own. The user interface is not friendly and difficult to program.

I am not really a fan of the seasonal adjustment periods, though. Twice a year, it goes into “learn” mode to update its programming to stay in sync with your preferences and to identify possible efficiencies. Thing is, it just seems to turn up your settings by a degree if you’re cooling, and down by a degree if you’re heating. Even if you override the new settings, it doesn’t learn and sets *its* preferences at the end of the adjustment period.

There are two things I hate about this thermostat that ruin everything good about it.  First is that I have a new house with a high thermal rating.  I need to be able to decrease the deadband (the swing between turning on and off) on the thermostat to allow it to run to a smaller increase and decrease in temperature.  I can’t, it’s a feature they lock you out of.  So my home swings 5+ degrees over and over both winter and summer.  Too hot then too cold.  I hate it, causes arguments i the house and no way to change it.  On any other thermostat it’s a simpler change.  

The second nasty thing is that twice a year Nest automatically adjusts your temperature settings to what they think it should be instead of what you set it to.  It’s either a few degrees up or a few degrees down depending on the season.  Compounded with the above deadband issue it makes our home intolerable.  You have to go back in and change everything each time they preemptively change it for the season.  There isn’t anyway to stop this apparently.

Alerts from NestCams and the Aware service we pay for are valuable. Especially with the number of package deliveries we get and the need for a watchful eye during covid due to increasing petty theft. 

That’s where the problems begin. Alerts are great but the Nest app startup is very long. Then once I select a camera to view live or recorded video, the wait is ridiculous. I could be waiting a minute before video buffers and a live stream or recording is viewable. If it from the doorbell ringing, our visitor may have already left before I can see them and respond!

The learning mode works poorly unless you have a very strict, same schedule, I guess, because we don’t and the app couldn’t learn well.

The reason my ranting is so low is because: trying to rewind the security footage and see something that happened at a specific time is frustrating and broken. This is a huge issue for a security system to have. For some reason google thought a “snap” feature in the timeline would be a good idea. When scrubbing through the timeline the play head will “snap” to an event. The issue is that the events always start in the middle of the event and you can just rewind a few seconds to see the beginning of the event. The “snap” feature will keep snapping back to the same place or you have to rewind a few minutes and watch nothing for a while to see the beginning of the event.

The ring app is so much better!  My nest worked correctly for a week. Slightly harder to set up your zones than a ring, but all in all it was fine. Then without a reason, it has just stopped recording video. I can only see a snap shot of an event, no video. No sound. Literally a still picture. Not what I need. Not what I paid for. I can’t find any tech support available on the app. With a ring I only needed tech support once, so I just called them a spoke with a person that helped me. Nothing like that available with nest.

The schedule screen in the app is terribly inconvenient: it voluntarily rotates the screen, and it's hard to hit the back button - always takes me at least 3-4 attempts.
The app starts so slowly that in most cases it's easier to come over and manually rotate the bezel.

I also wish there were more stats and graphs. Room temp during the day, humidity, correlation between room temp and outside temp. Currently there is nothing. Currently i own this ""smart"" thermostat, but i still had to get a separate device to simply track the temp/humidity over time.

The app homepage is simple and straightforward. Overall, it is pretty user friendly.

However, the schedule settings need an upgrade because resetting the schedule is very tedious. If you want to clear the schedule, you have to remove each item individually. And you cannot select more than one. There’s no “Clear All” button. It’d be very useful to include a “Clear All” button next to the ”Add” and “Remove” buttons.

Cool trick I just figured out. Two ways to speed up the process of clearing the schedule. Both are Copy/Paste solutions.

1) Clear one day, copy it, Then select a different day and paste. Repeat until the schedule is clear.

2) clear the schedule except for one item. Then hit “Copy Week” (note: deselect the day). Assuming you have more than one Nest thermostat, you go to a different schedule and hit “Paste Week”.

I would recommend the first solution. It’s simpler and faster.

Clips only and no history on iPhone: all you will see is the vertical lines on top right of your Nest cam view and only the clips will appear below. Click the “off” button on your iPhone (for my 2020 iPhone SE, it’s the top right button). When you turn the iPhone back “on” via face or thumb print, the same Nest camera view will reappear but now the horizontal history lines will appear best to the vertical clip lines in the Nest camera view.

Nest attempts to “learn” your temperatures by remembering every time your adjust the thermostat.    The problem here is I don’t adjust my thermostat at the same time every day and to the exact same temperature.   So I’m often finding myself at some random time saying why am I so cold? Or so hot?   I go and check the temperature to find out that nest decided I wanted it warmer (or colder) because last Tuesday I set the temperature.   But it then resets it to Wednesday’s temperature the next day (which may be different).
Nest does have a schedule where you can set the temperature but often, if you randomly adjust it for say a party or a dinner with friends nest will yet again decide that this is the preferred temperature at that time so next Friday be prepared to have your heat suddenly turn off ( or the AC)

The interface lacks day and night modes, so some interfaces blind you at night, such as the schedule interface, or the fan schedule interface (bright white at night isn’t good for my eyes).

The temperature sensors’ capability is limited. Only being able to change their priority to a fixed four, who knows what time, schedule, is annoying.

Showing the temperature of the sensors and the thermostat in super small font on the device display list is ridiculous.

If a connection with the thermostat hasn’t been made recently, the interface shouldn’t pretend it’s got recent information. I’ve had it show outdated data while the thermostat reported wildly different info.

The app should do a better job learning from my location to know when I’m coming home from work, to start preconditioning, since I do not have a regular work schedule, so I can’t really set a schedule that’ll actually be accurate.";"2021-12-03T00:17:47-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=464988855&type=Purple%20Software";"464988855";162;"en";"POSITIVE"

Over time, it finds out what you want via your chosen patterns and then changes them so that you follow its wishes.  I can’t tell you how many times I have woken up and been hot in the summer and all because it chooses a comfort zone beyond what you consistently programmed to be your preference.

-Decent amount of options / settings.

Cons

-You have to give Google access to all your personal information / google email account for some reason?? Sick of this kind of stuff. 
-The Nest “learning” part doesn’t come quickly. In fact, it really never worked for us, even after 1+ years of “learning our behaviors”.  
-Can only add 1 schedule the fan. We have little kids and we like to have the fan on while we’re sleeping. It won’t let us schedule it to come on at night but also during the kids nap in the afternoon. Seems insignificant (especially if you don’t have kids) but I was able to do that on our last thermostat.

I tried reversing the process — deleting both devices, then adding the thermostat first and then the doorbell. Whew! For some reason, adding them in that order worked.

My app periodically (once a week-ish) signs me out. That’s not a huge issue, just annoying.

The app will sometimes think I’m away when I’m home, so my cameras are on when I don’t want them to be, or vice verse (I’m not home, it says I am and disables the camera). And yes, I’ve verified what products detect when I’m home and adjusted accordingly - same issue happens.

Or, the app will recognize I’m home and still keep my cameras on or, again, vice versa (know I’m away, turn my cameras off).
