I’m pleased";"I have 4 stars because of some minor issues but for the most part, I am pleased with this purchase. I had a slight problem setting it up there was slight differences in the LED color that the directions explained versus what the actual color was for the setup process (the camera has an LED that can display in different colors). The live feed for me is only off by about a second or two off (not too bad). When I’m home I turn the camera off but there seems to be a delay when I turn it back on before it reconnects (about 3-4 minutes or so). There again, for the price I paid I thought it was well worth the small investment and I’m pretty pleased. I would recommend this product.";"2019-12-08T18:16:23-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=464234175&type=Purple%20Software";"464234175";133;"en";"POSITIVE"

We are using it as a replacement baby monitor for our Withings camera. The video quality is great. There seems to be very little lag at all, especially compared to the Withings app we used before. One issue I have so far.. I have ""Always Listening"" enabled, but if I have the camera on in the app and app open on screen, and then shut off iPad screen, the video/audio stops and the app closes. But if I leave the app on in the background, then the video/audio will continue when I shut off the screen. As I mentioned, I use this as a baby monitor. I would like to be able to shut off the screen with app open, still hear audio, and be able to turn screen back on to see the video right there. Quite frustrating. Otherwise, decent app so far.

Update: I have to turn on the camera probably 10-15 different times before it will actually turn on thru the app. Unbelievably frustrating. Then it will finally, magically, decide to turn on and work.

The video response time is very slow. And it is also very noisy. Even if no one is at home, and the house is pinned silent, it still makes a lot of notice not sure from where!!!
Setting up was not easy because if you have cable internet, it does not work with any wifi other than 2.4 ghz. 
Night vision is horrible, you basically do not see a thing but very blurry shadow. 
You can buy some 15-20 dollar wifi webcam and it serves the same quality like this one. 
Bottom line is, if you want to spend this much money you should consider other brands. Their customer support is from Russia and the agents are very rude.";"2016-12-14T10:58:59-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=464234175&type=Purple%20Software";"464234175";147;"en";"NEGATIVE"

1) The app as a rule has roughly 8 seconds delay from the time something happens to when you see or hear it. 
2) The image quality settings do not appear to do anything.  I set mine to always use low because the drops outs and lag were so bad.  Despite this, it still appears to try to optimize the image resolution.  It then drops out when an event occurs as it buffers and reduces the quality.   So you neither hear not see the triggering event.  
3) The persistent audio feature doesn't work consistently.  Sometimes it turns off as soon as the display shuts off (I found pushing the app to the background before turning off the display sometimes helps this). Sometimes it turns off when it has a lag event.  And finally sometimes it will work for hours and then shut off at an unknown time in the middle of the night leaving you in a panic over the health of your newborn that you were listening to. 

I believe a couple of the issues are:
1) The fact that all of the data collected from the cameras must be uploaded to ivideon's servers and then streamed to the device.  This might make sense for remote access, but not if both devices are on the same network.  It is hugely inefficient and simply doesn't work as implemented.  
2) The previously mentioned attempt by the app to always use the maximum image resolution.  The advertised image quality just isn't supportable as currently implemented.  

I am running this on iPhone 5s, with an always up to date OS.  I have an Asus RT-AC66U gigabit router running on Xfinity cable internet in a suburb. There should be no bandwidth issues in this signal chain.  

As the title says, this app is not useful as a baby monitor.  I will keep looking for a better implementation of the concepts attempted by this app.";"2015-10-15T17:57:43-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=464234175&type=Purple%20Software";"464234175";333;"en";"NEGATIVE"

Rarely have I not been able to connect to check things when the motion censor pings me. However, my second camera quit after a few weeks and their tech support couldn't get it working again and, disingenuously IMO, finally blamed AT&T's modem or router, which works fine with everything else connected to it including 3 others cameras, 2 from Amazon and Ivideon. Why they wouldn't just take a relatively new camera back to see what was really wrong with it was not explained or offered. Evidently, after one month you are on your own with these cameras.

Also needs dvr rewind to see what just came through.
Also need longer recording times on alerts.

The 24 hour record of sound and motion and the alerts to my phone give me the freedom to  be away for short periods and still know what is happening with her.
