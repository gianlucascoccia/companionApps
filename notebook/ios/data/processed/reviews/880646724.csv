I use it to turn on my espresso machine in the morning so it's warmed up and ready for me when I get up. However the scheduling feature of the app is not reliable. If you setup different timers for different days of the week they randomly change themselves. I solved this by setting up one timer for every day of the week and just manually changed the time before I went to bed. This worked well for several months but then the timer would randomly change itself. The switch is much less compelling to me if the timer feature can't be trusted.";"2017-07-04T12:41:30-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=880646724&type=Purple%20Software";"880646724";121;"en";"POSITIVE"

The graphical user interface in this app is a complete joke. It is taken straight out of the early 2000's. It is almost archaic to the point of non-functionality. The app is also quite buggy-as others have pointed out.

The switches work fine and the on/off function from the app works well, but the schedule function does not work and so is very inconvenient and not what I was hoping for.  App needs an update.";"2017-12-16T02:49:08-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=880646724&type=Purple%20Software";"880646724";46;"en";"POSITIVE"

It doesn't save count down timer setting, so you need to reprogram count down every single time.  2. You can only program a single schedule & all subsequent attempts will overwrite the 1st program, but will be listed as a separate program, 3. There is no way to remove a schedule program, 4. Count down timer display doesn't count down ... You have to manually refresh screen to see updated count down ... and this is just the beginning.  The device HW seems ok, but please hire someone who had graduated from high school to program your app ... You'll get many returns because of the quality of your app.  I know your problem is software because I'm an engineer.  Many other people will think they have a faulty device.";"2015-05-31T16:22:20-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=880646724&type=Purple%20Software";"880646724";152;"en";"NEGATIVE"
