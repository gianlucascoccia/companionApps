Then last week noticed app no longer gave correct status readings ( showed units running when in fact they were off , and current and set temperature values were reversed).  Checked for new updates but none available last week.  Decided to delete one of the thermostats from app and add it again.  Big mistake.  I cannot get through the install process.  App gets to point to select network name and then nothing.   iPhone setting shows it available but no options from there.  I have tried deleting the app, backup data, reset thermostat to factory settings, nothing seems to help get the app to add the device.  Saw new version yesterday and downloaded it but same issue.  Not supposed to be this difficult to work with an app.  It is now Friday December 4, 1:30 pm central standard time and have been on hold on phone with customer support for 1 hour and 55 minutes with no indication when they will get to me or if there is even anyone at the office.

I used to be able to change it and it will follow the schedule properly (or even if I leave the schedule alone). Now, the schedule won’t change until you go to the app and close it, open it again and maybe if you are lucky it will show “following schedule”, otherwise, you have to close and reopen the app several times. It is always showing “no schedule”. Also, before when I click and adjust the temp, it will give me an option to either hold for a period of time, hold temporarily or remove hold, now it does not do that all the time, sometimes I click out of the main page where you adjust the temp and go back and it will show up, most of the time I have to close the app out a few times to be able to get these options to show up. Also, I did not change any of the settings in the app nor the thermostats and the only thing that I change constantly is the temp and schedule which I used to do all the time and the app always follows the schedule. Obviously something got messed up on the updates, I wish they leave the app alone, I understand that it is necessary for security purposes but sometimes if it ain’t broke don’t fix it.

Recently however, (since they changed to the Honeywell home app) the geofence has been sporadic at best. When I get home after 9 hours away at work to find that the thermostat never turned down and my house has been toasty warm all day, it is beyond frustrating. If it only happened once or twice I would have an issue with it, but it has occurred many times now.  I tried contacting tech support (because they were extremely helpful when I purchased the thermostat) only to be left waiting for a rep for over an hour with no response (three times now). I also tried chatting with a tech support rep with a similar hour plus wait with no response. My final attempt at emailing tech support was responded to after about a week (despite the fact that their web site says they will respond within 48 hours).  Unfortunate the email response did not provide a solution so I responded to the email with additional information. That was over a week ago and I have still not received a response.

The app was clean and simple, but after using it for almost two years, I’ve realized it’s too simple and their support doesn’t care. The app lately has gotten very slow. It takes a minute or two for the app to display the current temperatures or settings of my thermostats. Nest let you set a schedule but override that with geolocation.  Nest also ran the fan for a forced-air system for several minutes after the burners or compressor turned off to push that bonus heat or cooling around, saving additional money. Honeywell has neither feature. When I’ve asked about why I can’t have both geolocation and a schedule for my thermostats, I’m told “you currently can only have one or the other” with no explanation why or timeframe for it to get added. In fact, it doesn’t sound like they have any plan at all to implement these features. Honeywell Home is not actually Honeywell anymore, but was spun off to Resideo. Maybe Resideo doesn’t have the resources to properly support the app or the motivation to care, but now I’m stuck with a worse and worse app that hasn’t added features in…ever? and support that doesn’t want to actually listen to its customers.";"2021-08-30T10:33:54-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=880332077&type=Purple%20Software";"880332077";225;"en";"POSITIVE"

If you’re looking for a WiFi thermostat stay as far away from Honeywell as possible. Customer service hours are very limited, which when you’re thermostat is out at 3AM, for the third time this month and it’s 18 degreees out, know that there will be no one to help you, period. But also know that you’ll regularly lose the connection between app and thermostat, and you have to set it up again as if it’s a new thermostat, which takes close to 10 minutes, and sometimes it won’t connect without reaching out to customer service and getting help with a hard reset. I can’t tell you all what a mess this thermostat, app, and company customer service is in a reasonable amount of time, but I can say I have another house with a competitor thermostat and in the three years I’ve also had that one I’ve NEVER had one issue! My Honeywell has issues on a monthly basis. BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!! 
UPDATE: the app will now just not work. I have been using it with continued random issues, but now when the app opens it just gets stuck on the page with the Honeywell opening screen (hallway table and backpack with the name) and won’t do anything, deleting and reinstalling doesn’t help.

However, it is constantly disconnecting from the WiFi (multiple times a day). It only seems to remain connected to the WiFi when my phone is connected to the same WiFi. Now imagine if you have an upstairs and downstairs thermostat, with corresponding WiFi’s. Even if you try to access the system from home, one of them will always show as offline because you can’t be on two WiFi’s at once. Do I need to get into accessing it remotely, if I can’t even access it from home??

In addition, it has so many bugs. I will go in and change a temperature setting and the app reverts right back to where it was. For example: My thermostat is off, I will go in and turn the heat on via the app. The screen will allow me to change it and then seconds later, reverse it back to off, as if I never turned it on. Lastly, it will sometimes completely drop one or both of the thermostats from the app. 

The whole point of this app was the be able to control the thermostat remotely. If I have to be at home on the WiFi to access it, there’s no point. If I have to go directly to the thermostat to update it because the app is undoing my selections, again there is no point to this. It feels like such a waste of time and money.

iPhone 13 Pro: Compared to the Total Connect app, this is a huge downgrade. Weather takes forever to update on the main page but my biggest gripe with the app is that it is VERY slow to update and respond to thermostat changes. For example, when I open the app, it will be stuck on the last known settings (mode, temp, etc) - even if the settings are outdated (e.g., I changed the temp on the screen since I last used the app or someone else changed them on the app). If I change the settings at that point and then close the app, no changes will be registered (even thought the app temporarily reflects the change). Instead, I have to open the app, click into one of the thermostats, go back to home, minimize the app and continuously navigate back to the app until I see the settings update. At that point I can finally make a change and it's a >50% chance that the change will successfully apply. It's a guessing game if I don't know what the current settings are. Instead, I went back to the TC app which updates immediately and shows the settings in real time. Hopefully, they don't fully retire the TC app. Otherwise, there are plenty of other smart home devices to choose from.";"2021-12-09T06:07:26-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=880332077&type=Purple%20Software";"880332077";235;"en";"POSITIVE"

I then checked the app settings thinking maybe I’d muted something accidentally during set up, but this was not the case— I found no way to adjust or specify the alert types. In my view my phone should be blaring a loud alarm when a leak is detected. It’s an emergency, right? A badge alert does no good whatsoever, and if there was an audible alert, it was too short and didn’t even arouse me from sleep. This is very concerning, because if I hadn’t woken up by coincidence myself and happened to 1) check my phone and 2) notice the tiny little badge notification on my phone, there could have been thousands and thousands of dollars worth of damage taking place and I’d have no knowledge, being I was out of earshot of the alarm on the detector itself.

I open the app, select heat, select save, and it looks like it worked...except when I reopen the app, it goes back to cool on its own, the thermostat will not accept app changes, only manual changes keyed into the thermostat actually change its settings.

We shut them off for the season and have not been able to get them working again this year. I’ve reset our router, run the repair protocol through the thermostats themselves, factory reset the thermostats, deleted and redownloaded the app...all to no avail and each step creates a new sticking point. Sometimes it can’t find a network, sometimes it goes all of the way through setup and then errors out at the very end, and now it won’t even begin setup because the app shows the connection to my thermostat but won’t ever proceed to the next screen when it’s tapped (it just highlights gray for a second, signifying it recognizes the tough, but does nothing).

My only complaint is that sometimes it doesn’t recognize that my wife is home.   I set it to give me an alert and I keep having to turn the geofencing feature off until I get home.  Aside from that quirk it is terrific.

Second complaint is data logging, or the lack thereof.   It’s not a comfort issue or anything like that but I find it amazing that there’s no way to see how many hours it’s operated or in what mode and what the temperature was say every hour for at least a day or a week.  At one point I set the modes too close and believe that it would heat up the house then turn on the A/C to cool it back down.  With a data log feature I’d have seen that sooner.

My wife is disabled and we don’t leave the house at regular times each day so the competition’s device that “learns” your schedule was of no use to us.  In theory this is a much better option however Honeywell needs to build in a data logger and definitely needs to fix the Geofencing reliability.

I think it’s poor Honeywell App integration coding with HomeKit, third (3rd) party customer support (Honeywell Corp selling Division) and lack of WANT by Honeywell to continuing to support said product, even though it has a five (5) year warranty!
I have everything from window blinds, outlets, etc that is a whole Apple HomeKit “smart home”. The Honeywell thermostats and their App integration with Apple HomeKit is the ONLY problem devices I have. Hmmmmmm

Can’t believe Honeywell would put out such an inferior, useless app for its product. VERY disappointed - we got the unit to be able to control it when we are away, but it doesn’t stay connected to our WiFi and the app is so basic and rudimentary - it does not have any features that mirror the device other than temp up or temp down. What a huge waste of money this thing was. Would return it if I could. Honeywell, if you care about customer satisfaction you should invest in better app technology so, at a minimum, all your devices features are accessible via the app. Would NOT recommend this device until Honeywell upgrades their app to have a stable WiFi connection and has significantly greater features on their app. Until that happens, this product is a waste of money if you’re need if flexibility and control when away from your home.

Not  as pretty as Nest or Ecobee, but nicer than my previous Honeywell internet thermostat, and much better priced. Set-up was a breeze, as well, with zero hitches. Obviously other have had major headaches. Not sure what accounts for the difference. Geofencing could be improved as the App only allows for one perimeter. I’d like it to change the temp when I leave and arrive my house, but also when I leave work so it can warm or cool the house by the time I get home. Apple Home (or HomeKit as many people call it) does this, but it’s a bit confusing to use two apps instead of one. My iPhone was consuming the battery quickly, until I turned off location services on the Lyric app and only allowed while using the App on the Apple Home app. It still knows where I’m at even even if I don’t have either app loaded, but battery usage is much better. Honeywell sent me a few “appreciate your comments” reply’s to my posting elsewhere.

Every time a manual change or any change is made to the thermostat, it does not revert to schedule!!! Even a manual thermostat can do this!! It’s not just me, I asked my sister who has the same thermostat and she has the same situation.

(1) Capability to lock the panel with a pin from the app, (2) add Works with Vivint for basic temperature and home/away/vacation control and (3) set schedules to allow for the option to give priority to specific user geofencing. Since the units capture outside temperature and inside humidity, a useful feature would be to be able to set a unique Eco mode option to maintain an average temperature based on +/- of outdoor temperature. Maybe the same for humidity too. Besides these innovative opportunities, the app UX or user experience is slim to load fast and the controls you need most are easily accessible to change right up front.

For nearly a month my thermostat was running a program I did not want, but could not change because it could only be programmed from the app. I regretfully have 4 Lyric thermostats and a leak detector which I purchased with the primary intent to monitor and adjust the temperature in my homes remotely.

Then times where I’m constantly closing and reopening the app because it hasn’t refreshed. Or I select follow schedule and it continues to show a temp that is absolutely not my schedule, I will get up to physically look at my thermostat and it’s doing exactly what it’s supposed to be doing but the app simply isn’t refreshing properly.

 I’ve just never been happy with this app, seems to perform VERY POORLY AND SLOWLY. The original Total Connect Honeywell app I had on our last houses unit seemed to work so much better.

Then the app requires precise location at all times- battery drain, privacy issues. 
Then the connection goes…. Horribly. Had to try multiple times to get it to work. 
Then, one day my thermostat starts displaying this message that it needs to be registered…. I’m thinking, I know I did that. 
Get into the crappy app that I never actually use and it forgot me. Had to do a password reset, then had to try to go BACK THROUGH the multiple failures of connecting the app to the product.

Thermostat is used year round, however furnace and AC are used more frequent during some seasons than other. Under extreme weather season, one is used 24/7. Thus, filter reminder at 2 or 3 months doesn’t apply because it assumes that number of operating hours are the same for all seasons/months. Reality is that filter change out is dependent on hours of furnace/AC operation. Our previous thermostat had a filter reminder based on hours of operation and that worked really well — i.e., changing filter out every 300 hour of use was good practice as used filter looked the same at change out, regardless of season. A smart thermostat with email or text reminder to change filter base on hour of operation/use would be a perfect maintenance tool. We’re big fan of Honeywell and look forward to future updates.

So I have to wait 1-2 minutes before the app “catches up” with the most recent settings before I can adjust the temperature. It’s not clear that it hasn’t updated so often times I’ll change the temp in the stale app and nothing happens. It’s quite frustrating. I think it can be fixed.

For example: the T10 WiFi thermostats when in Off mode, do not show the current humidity. In place of the humidity information it shows “System Off” it should show both. Also there should be some offset adjustment between actual temperature and what the system measures for both the thermostat and individual remote temperature sensors. They seem to all be about 3° off. If you offset the main sensor, the remote sensors are no longer effective at controlling the temp since they will always drive the system to a way lower temp.

One issue I found that I didn’t like was you have to set everyone living in your house with the app on there phone.  There is no admin everyone shares the same privileges.

Geofencing: So far it has worked well for me but I would like to have the ability have more than 1 temperature setting for when I am home & awake.  Such as have the temperature at 70 degrees starting at 7:00 a.m. & then step it up to 72 degrees at 10:00 and maybe another temperature change for the afternoon.  

Also, the app should save the temperatures that are programmed in it for BOTH geofencing and schedule control. Because Geofencing does not currently have the level of control I previously mentioned, I suspect I will switch back & forth between Geofencing and Schedule control. I’ve noticed when I do this, the app loses the temperatures I had previously set and I have to program it each time I switch. (Ex: If I switch from Schedule to Geofencing & then back to Schedule, the temperature settings I had in Schedule are gone - replaced with what I assume are default temperatures.)

It’s now 2021 and we still have nothing. Total scam.

Regarding the app itself, there are two other big deal-breakers I wish I had known before purchasing:

1) If you want the energy-saving benefits of geofencing, you can’t set a separate weekend sleep schedule. This is bizarre as the two things are obviously mutually exclusive. So if you like to sleep in on the weekends (most people), you’ll have to manually set the thermostat to Away each time you leave your house for the rest of your life.  If you choose to do a manual schedule you CAN set separate weekend hours, but then it disables the geofencing. Completely baffling. 

2) It’s very difficult, if not impossible to figure out what the thermostat’s current status is. I’ll hear it running and wonder “is it heating? Is it cooling? Is that the humidifier? I hope not, it’s too humid in here.” Good luck checking; I couldn’t figure it out.

The geofencing only tracks the moment you cross a boundary - not if your device is in or out of the geofence at any time. This means if your service is compromised at the exact moment you re-enter the boundary, the app won’t register that you’re home and it will stay that way until your device leaves and returns at a later time. As a result your thermostat will be wrong all night, or if the problem occurs with your wife’s phone, when you leave the house in the morning the thermostat will change to “away” even though she’s still home. Then she’ll be upset (with you) that the house has heated up.

Instead, it is likely the firmware within the thermostat that is not sufficiently automated to auto reconnect to an interrupted WiFi signal.

Then, it claims to control multiple products on one app. That’s not true… I can only view the temperature of my other thermostat. Any changes I make from the app won’t affect the other thermostat so I have to go into the other app to change that thermostat.

My installer chose this Honeywell thermostat and told me the wonderful things (🙄rainbows and sparkly unicorns 😆) it could do.  He did not mislead me, I simply BELIEVED it would be a smart device; I e found it isn’t much more than a dumb thermostat.

A few features I thought it should have:

1. OCCUPANCY SENSOR - Is the room occupied? Thermostat adjusts to preset temp.  Is the room unoccupied? Thermostat adjusts to another preset temp.

2. DATE SCHEDULER - Set system activity for specific and multiple days (next 30, 60. Or 90 days; or recurring event for every Tuesday, for example)

3. TIME SCHEDULER - Same as date schedule but controls event based upon a start time (3:00 pm for example) and a stop time (6:45 pm?) OR specify a start time (3:00 pm) and a duration time 120 minutes.

4. SMART TV INTERFACE? - Maybe there is a TV interface to allow changes via TV screen. I do not like to access my phone SCREEN when I should be able to access the tv SCREEN I am currently watching

5. ALEXA capable? - I do not know; I’ve not yet found any mention of Alexa 😞

The Lyric T5 thermostat will communicate with the Honeywell Home app, but does not function with HomeKit as it should. I have had a support case open for several months now, and despite explaining the situation to their support team, things just keep going in circles as they ask me to check the app version (even when there isn’t any change to the app) and reinstall or set up from scratch; neither of these permanently resolves the problem.

The fact that their newer T9 and T10 thermostats didn’t support HomeKit at launch as the T5 and T6 did (and still don’t support it) leads me to believe that they’ve given up on it.

Update: The developer have responded to this in a typical tone-deaf fashion (without even reading the review) by opening a new case for me when I already stated in my review that the current case isn’t being addressed and instructing me to reset the device when I already mentioned in the review that this doesn’t resolve the issue.

First of all, I use the thermostat with batteries rather than the c wire.  I have found battery usage is significant as a result.  It is not uncommon for me to have to replace the lithium battery once per month at least.  
Additionally the app often fails to connect with thermostat.  And heaven forbid you have to set up the thermostat again.  In that case, nothing but problems.
The setup program does not operate in concert with the thermostat.  It may ask you to press go to begin process, but the lyric thermostat is waiting for you to switch to its network.  The app doesn’t tell you what to expect at the time it should so you are often left guessing what to do next.  
When the app is searching for WiFi list at end of setup, it just sits there doing nothing while the thermostat says it is configured.  
As a result, the app never adds the thermostat to its device list requiring you to set up repeatedly.  
It is not what I expected and I would steer clear all together of this product until they can figure out how to make the thermostat deliver on the most basic features.

Furthermore once the network has been taken back to the year 2000 you have to use the app to get it all working and it usually takes 4-5 attempts of doing the same ridiculously bad steps of totally relying on a app to get it going.

Moved into the house a year ago and although had some occasional problems the thermostats (3) worked ok. After one of the more recent updates, the app does not communicate properly with the thermostat.  Thermostats life connectivity to the network. AC randomly switches to heat or the reverse happens.

While easy to set up, it is just not reliable. 

For instance, my home is a small ranch, about 1,200 sq ft, yet communications between the sensors and base station is sporadic. Two window sensors about 25-30 feet away from the base station and within sight of it are constantly disconnecting and re-connecting. 

I can’t put sensors on other windows farther away, because they cannot communicate with the base station. I have tried moving the base station to various parts of the house and always end up with some sensors being unable to communicate with it. Obviously the base station has terrible range. If it cannot handle my small house, it certainly cannot handle anything larger. 

Another disappointing feature is being unable to turn on and monitor the two sensor cameras I have. I can only monitor the base station’s camera, when it decides to work.

On the app itself the outdoor temp doesn’t seem to update unless you tap it. I also don’t get why if you have multiple thermostats you can’t put them in any order. Even if you custom name them & give them a number it just puts them in random order. This is annoying in commercial applications with multiple Tstats.

Although, motion notifications do not always happen even when a family member arrives home opens door (in camera frame) and walks in front of the camera several times. 

Original review:

Pretty annoying. I’ve been getting double notifications for every alert since version 3.8.1.  This is for the Lyric C1 camera.

Update: the Lyric team had me reset my C1 camera and uninstall, then reinstall the app.  Kind of a pain, but it cleared the issue. However, new issue is that I no longer receive geofence or motion notifications. Every time I open the Lyric app, it says it cannot log in to my account and pops up a “keep trying” or “cancel” dialog box.  When I tap “keep trying”, it does reconnect to the camera, but still no notifications and then next time I launch the app I get the same “cannot log in” notification.

As a remote control, the app is becoming increasingly unreliable because it is slow to refresh.

If I try to change something before it actually refreshes, the change gets lost.

Sometimes I might be able to force a refresh faster by tapping the weather to go into the weather screen.  Once that updates to current conditions the app seems to have caught up.
