It also has no way to change the WiFi network in the app - you have to do a factory reset on the camera just to change what WiFi you want to use. That is a horrendous pain to deal with when you are traveling and staying at a new place every night. It does not support background audio. It is completely dependent on “cloud” servers to function at all, even if you have the remote recording feature turned off. You can have a perfectly functioning LAN, but the whole thing will stop working if it can’t talk to Logitech. It desperately needs the ability to function locally in at least a basic mode. Ideally it could function in full mode too and be able to utilize NAS instead of cloud storage. Logitech used to be a great hardware company. Now they seem to be crippling their hardware to try and sell software service subscriptions. That is not what I or I imagine most people want.

This means that motion is detected near, but NOT INSIDE the zones and is notified still. What is the point of the zone feature I am paying for then???

Each time making a clicking noise in the room. The camera hangs from the wall above the crib, just as it did before the update.  I've tried rebooting and even a full reset with re-adding it to the account. Nothing changed. So it must be your update and it's probably server side as I believe that's how you control turning on the cameras night vision. It's not a decision the camera itself makes.

It seems that when you view the live feed, you are not streaming the feed directly from the camera, instead you viewing the feed that is being streamed to a Logi Circle server. It would be better off updating the application so that when you view the live feed you are pulling the stream straight from the camera and not from a Logi Circle server.

-Better geofenced smart alerts when signed in on 2 devices. Currently, if one device is home and another is away, the other device gets all the alerts. There should be an option to have alerts pushed ONLY when all signed in devices are away from home.
-app icons on left side can be pushed further left into the “notch” on iPhone X to improve cleanliness of video playback window. 
-Wi-Fi & battery status icons found on the camera settings page can be moved to the video playback window on the left side in the notch as well.

But when you read a little farther on the Logitech site, you discover that the circle 2 WIRELESS is not compatible. Again... the same exact camera that IS compatible, when hooked to a battery, becomes incompatible. 
Logitech blames Apple, but I’d guess that Apples testing revealed shortfalls in the battery powered setup and doesn’t want the Apple name associated with it. At least that’s what I’m going on.

Pros- 
Image quality during the day is really good. 
Camera setup is really easy. 
Wide field of view. 

Cons-
The night time recorded motion is horrible. Extremely dark. Good luck making out a person from 5ft away. The live view at night however is amazing. The app is garbage very buggy. Sometimes during the day my recorded images are completely washed out like the sun is shining directly Into the camera even though it's cloudy or before or after sunset. Other times my recorded images are pink during the day. You never know. All tech support has ever done over about 15 emails for the image issues was to restart the camera or delete it and re add it. Completely useless. 

It takes a minimum of 35 seconds if not more to connect live. My nest cam and ring cam will get to a live image in less then 10 seconds.

The app itself works great and I really have no complaints. The camera software has a little ways to go to be a real contender in the Security camera market.

There needs to be more cloud recording options that are reasonable in addition to adding zone support. Logitech's old camera system, the alert did zone support in this no reason why this camera shouldn't.

The most horrendous thing is being forced into landscape mode, all the time. As a user I should be able to choose what view mode I want to use whenever I want (portrait or landscape). Instead I’m forced to landscape which is stupid.

On the iPhone x2 while being forced in crummy landscape, the cameras don’t all fit. You need to scroll to see the image of any cameras beyond the second.

I need to login to the web app on a desktop to set zones on each camera. Stupid.

The app doesn’t have background audio. If your phone locks or if you minimize the app, the audio stream shuts off. So you need to have the app active and open to be able to stream.

The fact that I can’t just change the WiFi and have to manually reset the camera to achieve this goal is stupid. I should just be able to change and set this in the app and the camera should be smart enough to reboot itself. It’s not. If you installed the camera up high on the exterior of your home, plan on getting your ladder out just to change WiFi. Annoying.

Circle Safe (Logitech’s subscription service or cloud recording service: is spotty at best. I have 4 cameras installed on the same WiFi. At times 1 or 2 of them will show as offline and the other 2 online. I can go to the exact place the cameras are mounted and connect to the same WiFi access point and it’s working fine. WHAT?

Apple homekit on the wired version of the camera is spot on. My only criticism is with apple and HomeKit in its current state of restrictions and out of the control of Logitech. 720p..

It irks me when pseudo updates are created to make it look like issues are being taken care of when they are not. 

I STILL cannot download random events or events longer than 3 minutes!  I had an event I wanted to watch yesterday - it was 15 mins long according to the next time stamp (I have my cams with no time outs, supposedly 🙄) and when I went to watch it wouldn’t play. I decided to download, which it did- sorta. I go to look at video and nothing. 

Again, I use this for my mother’s medical history and caregiver surveillance. And my cameras are reduced to expensive paperweights and a useless app that just annoys me beyond words.  Do the right thing and actually produce an app that works as you boast it will. It’s not like this is your 1st tech rodeo. Either ride the bull or stop shoveling it into your worthless updates of an already broken app. Wake up developers!  Your ratings should have you pulling all-nighters to resolve what so many find exasperating!!

Answer:  A very upset customer!  The newest update or an internal cluster has rendered this app, and by proxy, the cameras useless. I can download only sporadic timed videos, if I’m lucky. 

I use this for medical history and elder security. A huge and expensive disappointment. Tech service is virtually nonexistent and/or useless. After a nonproductive CS phone call on December 26th, I was sent a cut/paste email with links to help with my problem, one of which held no relevance to my inquiry. 

UPDATE:  On December 27th I emailed back that the links were not resolving my issue. I’ve yet to here back from anyone. 

If free plan monitoring truly equals 24 hour recording time , then I should have the ability to download anything within that perimeter. To provide less than stated is false advertising and woefully embarrassing to your company.

I got it to monitor my car in my condo complex parking lot, though beyond about 10-15 feet, reading license plate numbers or seeing identifiable faces is all but impossible. But it’s unique window mount allows the camera to be placed where other cams wouldn’t work for me. There’s also an incessant rapid clicking noise in the audio, like a playing card being ran over bicycle spokes. Very weird, and just really annoying in general. 

The Logi Circle app itself, though, is really where things go downhill fast. First, the odds of its auto-record feature successfully recording an important event, like, say your car getting broken into, are pretty low. You might get the very beginning or the very end, before it cuts in/out, or a random segment in between. And if you happen to see something occurring in real-time that you’d like to record, then good luck with that same sketchy auto-record, as there’s no option for you to manually start/stop recording something. 

The other issue is trying to scroll back in time to view events from earlier in the day. I have 100/10Mbps internet over WiFi, and it regularly test at or above those speeds. The cam is in the same room as the WiFi router, and all other devices in the House work just fine from it, including an Arlo Q cam, which works much better than the Circle cam. In my somewhat busy parking lot, there might have a dozen to a few dozen events (people/cars going by, etc) auto-recorded per hour, but if you want to scroll much more than 2 hours into the past, then be prepared to wait. You’ll simply see a spinning wheel for every couple hours you want to go back, which won’t stop for about 1-3 mins, and when it does, you may or may not have a play button available to view an actual clip. Count on it taking about 10-15 mins to actually get to the beginning of a 24hr day. By that point you’ve likely given up, reminding yourself to never by another Logitech security camera again. 

You’ve been warned. Unless you must have a camera that mounts to a window, there is absolutely zero reason to ever consider a Circle cam, and it’s embarrassingly bad app, over just about anything else that’s out there.";"2020-10-27T16:41:21-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1018340690&type=Purple%20Software";"1018340690";397;"en";"POSITIVE"

If it wasn’t for Apple HomeKit support and being able to view the cameras in the home app I would have already returned the cameras, here’s why:

The app only talks to the cameras through the Logitech servers over the internet, even if you are in the same network as the camera it won’t talk directly to the camera. You guys need to allow for a LAN connection, if HomeKit can do it so easily then it can’t that be hard to add a simple little toggle for this feature in your app. I’m still waiting for them to connect my fiber, which means I have pretty slow internet and it makes viewing the cameras at home in my own network in this app an extremely slow and a very delayed experience, to the point where it’s unusable!!! If it wasn’t for HomeKit’s ability to view the camera over the LAN network I would have returned the cameras. IT’S A MASSIVE OVERSIGHT!
The app is stuck in landscape mode, I don’t like the fact that I’m forced into landscape mode.
The UI feels generally awkward and unintuitive, the timeline bubble thing on the side is pretty good but the rest of the app just feels a bit clunky and hard to navigate, it’s mostly to do with being stuck in landscape.
There’s no picture-in-picture mode for the iPad, again, Apple HomeKit can do it but your app can’t.
There’s no Apple TV app, I hardly use other apps on my Apple TV but being able to view my security cameras on my TV (WITH A LAN CONNECTION) would be brilliant, please fix this app with LAN support and bring it to the Apple TV.

Additionally the ability to have the cameras record to a local NAS device would be fantastic and make these cameras worth twice the price in my opinion, I know you guys want to sell subscriptions but I guarantee that if you add that functionality you’d sell twice as many cameras as it would appeal to many many more people especially those with with slower internet speeds or capped data plans, not everyone likes the cloud or wants their cameras constantly uploading and using bandwidth, local network recording would take these cameras to a whole new level.

Apple’s HomeKit integration is a must, if you’re using these cameras and not using HomeKit you need to try it out, for me it’s the only reason I haven’t returned the cameras, it allows for LAN connections and iPad picture-in-picture support as well as fantastic notifications that allow you to view the camera from within a notification on your lock screen with a 3D Touch hard press, and if like me you have Philips Hue lights you can link the camera to the lights for automation for movement or my favourite little feature is the “light” button under the camera feed when viewed from a notification that will turn on all the lights in the same room as the camera. 

I’ve said it multiple times in this review and I’ll say it again. 
HOMEKIT MAKES THESE CAMERAS

These cameras are nothing without HomeKit, I don’t know what Android users do with these cameras because the logi app fall 500 miles short in terms of functionality and in cases where one has slow internet can make the cameras unusable even at home in the same network.

I’m very happy with the physical hardware, if you have Apple devices and can use HomeKit I would definitely recommend these cameras, but for right now the Logi app is only good for initial setup of the camera and playing back previously recorded footage, nothing else, all other functionality is found in the Home App on iOS with HomeKit. So if you’re an Android user too I’d wait a little while and see if Logitech gets their act together with this app because it’s nowhere near where it needs to be, I’d go as far as calling it half baked and unfinished.

I’d happily re-review this app and give it a 5-Star rating if you fix these issues, they should be sorted out ASAP, more and more people are going to try your products and the app is going to let them down and you will give yourselves a bad name. You guys still have the opportunity to make a big name for yourselves in this section of the market. Sorting these things out is of utmost importance for keeping this product alive, otherwise someone else will come along and do it better and this product will fade away. It’s been out for over a year, it’s long enough, there’s no time left for any excuses these are major oversights that are frankly embarrassing, you’d expect this from some new startup but not a big company like Logitech.
The Circle 2 has so much potential, please don’t neglect it.

At night, all the cameras reflected their IR lights on our windows' glass, so they did not work so well placed inside the house, looking outside at night. However, we were able to use the Logi Circle camera outside (during both the rain & a rare snow fall in our area, even though it does not say it's rated for outdoor use)! Additionally, the Logi has a magnetic base which I was able to place in more locations securely than any of the other cameras (without having to drill & screw in attachments).
All of the controls were simple to operate & all of its' functions worked exactly as we'd hoped!
