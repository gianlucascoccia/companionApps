Kinda annoying the punishment doesn’t fit the crime. They should have banned me from messaging people and that’s it. No reason I can’t save a clip or join my friends party. I also am annoyed at other things. I’m very glad I can see my stats and my friends stats, but I cant see them side by side. I have to go back and fourth to see how much ahead of my friends I am. I also can’t change my name. I used to be able to change my account name in the settings, but they removed that feature and the Microsoft website doesn’t let me either. So my name is always going to be the same. Last complaint is the look of the app. It’s pretty plain. It’s not in 4K or anything. Not a huge deal but it would make me enjoy it more.

Before the latest update, the xbox app was really good and I had very few issues with it. Ever since the new update, I have absolutely HATED using this app. Obviously this is my opinion right now, but I hate almost every single thing that has changed (and a bunch of my friends agree.) First off, the app takes longer to load in than it used to. Second off, the whole messaging / chatting with others is awful. Sending messages can be delayed a lot and sometimes not even send. You can't send pictures anymore. And also, if you have notifications on, it'll glitch over and over and over again whenever someone messages you (meaning even if you are on a chat with someone currently texting each other, whenever they text you, a notification will buzz at the top of ur screen.) This glitch is only fixed if u reload the app, and even then, after a few minutes of texting, the notification buzzing will still show up again. Another thing I hate is the online / offline thing. I don't like how when you are on a chat with someone, it says they are offline, even if they are actually online. It only says they are online on the home screen, which is very annoying. Honestly, the only thing I do like about this update is our captures all in one area.

Obviously this probably won't happen, but I feel like this app would be way better if the update was just taken off, and the app was reverted back to its old state.";"2020-10-23T17:39:58-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=736179781&type=Purple%20Software";"736179781";276;"en";"NEGATIVE"

You can access you account on the go and do so many things. However, the app’s downfalls become apparent very soon. First of all, you need a wifi connection to access the app, it will not work with cellular data. So, the whole aspect of xbox on the go is completely thrown out of the window. Secondly, you’ll be very luck if you can actually use the app. For at least one week out of the month the app just doesn’t work. You try to launch it, but you are met with either a blank green screen or a n infinite loading wheel. I’ve tried restarting, redownloading, and even costumer support, but nothing can fix it. Over time it will just fix itself and one day you’ll try to launch the app and it will just work for no reason just as suddenly as it stopped working. My final issue it the built in keyboard. Xbox has a wonderful system that detects the keyboard on your xbox and allows you to type on your phone. This is great for multiplayer games with a chat system. However, like the app itself this feature is very spotty. Sometimes the keyboard on the app will just stop popping up and it won’t ever pop up for the next week to month. Then it will just magically fix itself again. There are also tons of little bugs that litter that app that at sometimes, makes the app completely unusable. The Xbox app definitely doesn’t deserver the 4.7 out of 5 that it currently has.";"2019-07-29T16:29:42-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=736179781&type=Purple%20Software";"736179781";271;"en";"POSITIVE"

Your console is perfectly fine and your app was fine until you screwed it up. I love your console but there’s no need to try and battle with PS4 anymore.

I can’t even see who my followers are, because I don’t know how to get tothat section. All in all, this update was utter garbage.

Obviously I want to be notified whenever a new chat comes through- but NOT while I’m already in the chatroom. This isn’t a major issue for me, since I can cut off notifications and just manually check the chats every now and then, it’s just a mild inconvenience is all.

Voice memos is just a feature I would like to see implemented into the app, Instagram & Snapchat have voice memo like features (example of it being possible to put into an app) and the console version is a handy feature to have, if it’s possible to use the mic for parties, then adding voice memos to the app version as well seems like the correct next step.

Nor can you send pictures to people in messages. Normally I wouldn’t care about this since I don’t want to change my gamer picture, however one of my friends in order to spite me used this update to change my gamer picture and now I can’t change it back, I have to use a default picture. Which in fact is a real bummer. I like to have the freedom to customize my profile in any kind of social media. And no matter what you say Xbox is undoubtedly a social media, you can text, send game clips,(used to be able to send pictures), you can talk, and some other things but people don’t usually use these because Xbox is a console and is generally used for gaming. I can mind the glitches with the new update but I cannot overlook the fact that they have completely done away with a key feature in the profile customization.

However, there are a lot of smaller issues with it. The biggest issue that I have with it is that Microsoft removed the ability to change your profile picture from the app. There was honestly no point in doing this, since there was nothing wrong with it in the first place. Now, if you want to change your profile picture, you need to get a USB and plug it into your Xbox, wait for it to actually upload, and then you can change it. What was wrong with the old system of simply going into your camera roll on the app then choosing one that way? Another issue is that the app takes a decent amount of time to load, and sometimes won’t even load everything at once (such as your captures). There are also some smaller bugs, such as the app stating that people are offline when they aren’t. However, there are some good things about it (such as the addition of remote play), but in my opinion, they don’t outweigh the negatives.

Most of the time if it’s a party of let’s say four. You can hear one person at a time and every couple of minutes it allows audio of the next person to come through but shuts the other person off. The other half of the time you can’t hear a single person.

But recently those parties have been everything but convenient. Every time I join one, it starts to overheat my phone, and that’s the part I can live with. The part that irks me beyond comprehension is the fact that the parties are disconnected for up to 80% of the time you’re in one. Your friends can hear you and you can see from the ring around their pfp that they’re talking, but you can’t hear a word they say. It’s as if they’re mute when they’re not. This makes competitive and even casual games difficult to play with friends. Imagine playing a PVP game such as Apex or R6 and your teammates makes a callout that could save you. But the party was disconnected so you miss the callout and you die. It’s a frustrating experience, and it is more common than not. I don’t know what causes this, and I know it’s not connection issues because those come with alerts, and I have relatively decent connection to begin with.

It has been very difficult for me to utilize. I prefer the original version over this garbage. First off, why would Microsoft remove the achievements and activity feed section? I can’t even see nor can I compare with friends: the hours we played, game statistics, achievements unlocked/locked, and even gameplay clips and images.

In addition, I don’t like the fact that my profile page doesn’t include every single game from my library. It even removed my personal activity feed. In other words, I hate the highlights section. The only thing I seem to like about the app is the fact that I can connect my iPhone and Tablet to Xbox One and project games over to it however, it’s not enough to impress me.

I really hope Microsoft see this message and considers reverting back to the original version of the app because there was nothing wrong with it at all.

Cons: New update took away the activity feed, so community/sharing elements of Xbox are pretty much gone. In the old format my friends would watch each other’s clips via activity feed and comment/like each other’s posts. This is now totally gone. The notification system is also partially broken. I used to get notified when my favorite’s were online, but now no matter how I set it up the app does not set me push notifications for status’. 

This use to be a great app with some mild glitches, but now it’s become a pretty “milk toast” app. Unless you were wanting an app solely to purchase games before turning on your Xbox, this app’s update has taken away its most useful & engaging features.

The name that you have put up their (example Cake) will be up their when you send emails to people it will have the name cake up there on top of it.

Sometimes I just need to use my mobile device as a second screen. 

I have a solid AC1900 router and I’m connecting with an iOS device on 5Ghz and there are often connectivity issues for no apparent reason. While the PS Remote Play app connection seems to stutter during heavy game activity, the Xbox app seems to just randomly get weak signal and connection. I could be playing something not very demanding like Minecraft and this app will go in and out of strong connectivity when nothing else is happening on the home network.

When it works, this feature is extremely convenient, letting you input text to your Xbox or games in time spans you never could without the app. But good freakn’ luck getting the keyboard on the app to come up when you have an on-screen keyboard on your console. It’ll work sometimes, and other times you can pull up the keyboard on your Xbox again and again and again - to have the app do nothing. Which, needless to say - is very frustrating.

There's only one small issue that I've noticed and compared to the rest of the amazing features, it's a relatively small gripe. 

Nonetheless, the messaging system within the app works wonderfully but it also contains the only thing that bugs me. It's very time consuming to cleanup or delete old messages. Having to slide left and delete them all individually takes quite a while if you receive messages frequently. Also the difference in text color between a new message and a message marked as ""read"" is so subtle that it becomes difficult to locate unread messages when trying to cleanup notifications. 

My suggestions:

Install a feature that will let the user select multiple messages at a time and delete them or mark as read. 

Change the color of the font on new messages and read messages to something more drastic. Perhaps a green text for new messages and white text for read messages.

Overall, as I stated in the beginning, I love this app! And I believe updating the messaging system will only increase my enjoyment and ease of use for everyone. 

Cheers!

The one thing I really wanted to do is msg people, and download  and manage my clips. The former works well enough, though not good. It takes awhile to send and update messages and going through old ones is a nightmare, (this transfers to the console aswell). The clips are so terrible though. It is fine if you need to go through 1 clip to download it, but it will probably take you a minute to a minute and a half. To download 1 30 second clip. I seriously don’t know how they messed up clips so bad, it is horrendously slow and it doesn’t even let you download your clips half the time. This is especially frustrating when you consider Microsoft gives only a few gbs of cloud storage for clips until it starts deleting your old ones or not fully recording your new clips ( its random witch one it decides to go with) How does a multi billion dollar company mess up so bad. The only reason I use this is because there is literally NO other option.

You also used to be able to change profile pic using this app. Now im sure that has nothing to do with the app and more to do with Microsoft cracking down on stupid people making profile pics stuff that breaks tou, but it was still a really nice way to personalize profiles. Theres a “report profile pic” option for a reason. Otherwise great app, makes texting peeps in xbox 1000 times easier rather than trying to with a controller!

Edit: they have basically taken away every helpful feature. Finding people is more difficult. Trying to look at achievements or other game data for your profile is non existent to my knowledge. Its just not at all intuitive.

I’m glad there is still the ability to use your phone as a remote but other than that I’m very disappointed that a lot of the features on the previous version were left out on this new update.

The store and playing your clips. I find it really inconsistent when you’re watching clips you have recorded. Sometime the clip will run from start to finish without interruption and other times it struggles with 5 seconds in. I have a decent connection and I find that even when i’m using LTE it still struggles to play smoothly. My biggest problem however is the store. I wish it was better about showing new games that have released. As apposed to showing the most popular games which it does. I know I can search specific game but i’m looking for those gems and I cannot find them if the store only shows the fortnites and the fifas of the worlds. I know the phone app shouldn’t be the place for discovery but anything is better than what they currently have. Including the dlc tab which is usually just occupied with mutiple dlc of the same game.

I’m confused but I still reset my password and I write it down this time but still nope it doesn’t accept the password. Also I’d like to mention that the new update is questionable.

These bugs are often fixed by simply restarting the app, or in a few cases restarting the Xbox it’s linked to. Anyone that plays Xbox should probably have this app, seeing as it’s both free and rather useful. The ability to see and respond to messages, even if you aren’t on your Xbox is a great ability. The ability to tell which friends are online by going into the app or having it send you a notification of when they get online is also a favorite of mine. And the ability to type and copy & paste with your phone makes sending messages and inputting commands a breeze.

So I go back into the app and after about 30 secs or so, it quits again. It continues to do this consistently..so I stop using the app all together. 
The party chat is worse. After numerous attempts of trying to get it to work, you can talk for no more than about 3 minutes…And the app just suddenly quits for zero reason. This just happened to me 3 separate times. I used to use the voice chat once in a while, and never really had any issues. If I did they weren’t to this extent of not being able to even USE the voice chat. Highly disappointed.

UPDATE: Since the most recent update, things are still the same. The app quits out of nowhere EVERY TIME I use it. I can use it for probably around 30 or so seconds. Also, when I looked up a game to see info/pricing on it, it shows ZERO info..just a white blank screen, other than the cover art.

Bottom line, I got this app to be able to talk to my friends on Xbox live without a mic, and if you are trying to use the application for the same thing be prepared to deal with a lot of frustration.

This one has been ok, but I expect more from Microsoft. I mean, this is MICROSOFT we’re talking about. Over a trillion dollar market cap company and this app has many bugs. It’s dumbfounding. 

It’s not an awful app, but key features are broken. Whenever I try to view the videos I recorded on my Xbox  on the app, I can never get the videos to play correctly. How can this be so complicated? The most basic website has mastered video playback, but somehow, Microsoft struggles with it in the app. Some videos load. Others load then lag. Others present a sad face icon because they can’t load. And then other times I get a message from the app saying I’m stranded, basically admitting that there was an error. Ridiculous. 

Also there are issues with the remote play. Like the fact that you can’t. Oh sure you can connect to your Xbox. But even after following the on screen prompt to connect you controller to your phone, and confirming my controller was connected to my phone the app still asked for me to connect a controller and only gave me the options of “Bluetooth settings” and “skip”. The app will not recognize the controller connected to the phone via Bluetooth. 

These are the main bugs I’ve found, but I’m sure others are there. These are the most annoying for sure.

The Xbox app USED to be quite good, before this latest update completely and totally gutted all the awesome features the Xbox app was loved for.  

First: the layout.  The previous layout was straightforward and streamlined, this latest update has given “streamlined” a brand new definition.  There is almost little to no reason to even have the app downloaded as it only serves as a glorified remote control, that sometimes doesn’t even respond to my inputs.  The complete and total lack of features leaves the layout practically empty.  

Last: the features.  I used to be able to stalk my friends’ captures, achievements, etc.  and that was fun because it added a whole new dynamic of competition between friends, because the system also gave Time Played for each game and each gamer tag.  All of those features are gone.  You go to a friends profile and now you are greeted with highlights and your basic friend-moderation tools such as “report, remove friend, block” etc. 
why remove all the friend features?  Why remove all the darling features that have done well so far? 

Overall, the app used to be a solid 4.5/5 however due to Microsoft’s obsession with fixing things that ARE NOT broken, the update has brought this app down to a 2/5.

It’s very annoying watching someone’s clip and then it freezes but the clip is still going. And it take a long time to load a clip. In my opinion, xbox needs to allow an option when you watch a clip, you can change the quality to make it run smoother at least. At this point, xbox really disappointed me with the whole xbox industry when it comes to games. It’s like they don’t care about the app. In my view at least. Messaging in xbox also has some bug.

Second, you can’t see your achievements anymore, or the leaderboard with how many achievement points you have gotten over the month. And possibly, my final opinion, I hate how it takes longer to load into the app. Before the new update, it used to be quick and efficient, especially when you’re on a time limit, but now, it takes about 15 seconds just to load in.

We can no longer view and compare achievements. The achievement score is there but the previous ability to view the ones you’ve unlocked or see the progress of others yet to be unlocked is gone. We can no longer select a game and compare our achievements to a friend of our choosing, comparing achievements was one of my favorite perks of the app. Activity feeds are gone, we can no longer share captures to our own feeds or view the feeds of friends to get a quick rundown of what they’ve been up to.

Now it seems as though everything was removed other than your friends list and messages (which I hear are very buggy. I haven’t had issues though, simply because I don’t use the app for these features)

Although I can say that I absolutely LOVE the reworked smartglass features. The media controller now no longer has to reload/reconnect if you lock your phone or switch apps and come back. It is always ready to go once open. As well as the keyboard feature of smartglass being very simple and reliable. As well as the entire smartglass interface being all-in-one and located on one screen meaning I don’t have to load keyboard/volume controls which are now easily accessible when on the controller ready to be pulled up with a tap. 

If I can combine the app functionality along with the smartglass of this app it would easily be a 5/5. But because so many features were removed I have it a 3. The biggest use of the app for me is the media controller, which is now better than ever. But I don’t see any sense of removing the past features of the app which I did occasionally use. 

If you use the app only for the controller this update was perfect. If you use the app for anything else get ready to be disappointed.";"2020-12-04T19:18:25-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=736179781&type=Purple%20Software";"736179781";245;"en";"POSITIVE"

I frequently use the Xbox console companion app on my laptop to stream from my console and I expected this app would do the same on my phone. Instead, all the console feature seems to do is let me use my phone as a controller, which is pretty clumsy and fairly useless. What has me confused the most are screenshots depicting a phone connected to a controller and with the home screen in view like it is streaming. Could it be that I need this device to enable streaming? Not sure, but it wouldn’t make sense anyway. Controllers can already connect to an iPhone via Bluetooth. That said, just like the PC version of the app, the requirement to be on the same network as the console is a severe limitation. I’ve already worked around this by setting up my own VPN so I can play on the go with my laptop, but that shouldn’t be a necessary requirement.

The only reason I used the app was for the small and tedious stuff, especially because it made the small stuff easy to do without having to start up an entire console just to see my achievements or say my clubs and social. This app was fine until this update. Nothing can describe how small brain of a move this was. 

Let me just listed a bunch of amazing things you could do then easily from this app that 
you cannot do anymore thanks to this wonderful update.

-Check Achievements
-Compare Achievements and stats to friends
-Easily access friends’ and clubs’ posts
-Customize account easily
-Be able to use clubs

I could go on to small ones but these are major ones. At first glance you might look at this and go oh thats not bad only five things? When in reality these are core mechanics that make the app useful and not a pile of mush like most other mobile apps. “But like hey you can download games from your phone now oh so cool OoOoOh.” Like lets be honest if your downloading a giant game your not using your phone your starting up that console but oh, if you want to see achievements or clubs you gotta go onto the console just to see them? Now that just sounds stupid doesn’t it.

It makes everything concise yet shows you everything that you need to know. Most importantly to me, the app is way smoother. The app responds to gestures really fast and videos do not pause or lag. This made me very content.

I feel the app is missing two key features, including viewing your achievements and a main feed on friend’s captures. You can access your friend’s captures, but it does not feel very streamlined. You have to go to your friend’s profiles individually and find their captures. I wish their were a page to view all of your friends captures, collectively.

Overall, the app is a great improvement. I am happy with the update and hope that extra content can be provided in the future.";"2020-10-26T14:46:47-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=736179781&type=Purple%20Software";"736179781";144;"en";"POSITIVE"

I just don’t get how this really works. You can’t play games with your phone, many of the controller buttons are missing making account access hard and other issues. Totally wastes the term “Xbox in the go.” Like what are you supposed to even use it for? Just media I guess. Also when my Xbox is connected, it doesn’t let me even push the play button on a game.

Add touch controls to remote play  This will improve the remote play feature massively, as users won’t have to carry their controller on them if they want to play on the go. My vision is fairly similar to what Sony did with their remote play. Overall a good addition to remote play. 2.Return the app to its former “glory” As many of the of the reviews say, the app was fine as it was before the new console came out. Those features were like the cherry on top for the app. I think everyone would appreciate if those changes were reversed.

Other than messaging, offline mode has to be manually toggled off then back on again in order to engage after opening a clean startup of the app. We can no longer edit or even view our Xbox profiles. Cannot upload a custom profile picture, cannot even see or change bio.

That may not seem like much, but when you sit there and watch that little circle go round and round for 160 seconds when it should only take a few, it starts to wear on your patience.

On top of all that waiting, any time a page actually manages to load up, it’s no good. When I look for clubs through certain games the app kicks me out. If I search for a profile or attempt to glance at my activity, it kicks me out. I have the iPhone 7 with 50GB of storage, of which I’m only using 29 gigs. Whenever I go into the Xbox app I make sure to clear any cache I have on my device, and clear any other cookies and or tabs I might have open, so this app should NOT be timing out, nor should it take a century and a half to load.

I chose to rate this Xbox app one star in the hopes of gaining the developers attention. I grew up on PlayStation, but turned to Xbox in my teens and have been a loyal customer ever since, but too often are Xbox consumers’ questions, comments, and concerns ignored by the company.

Some of the features where it picks up on people’s microphones: is broken. Occasionally it will or won’t pick up at all and recently hasn’t been working if inviting someone to a party.

What else do I love about this app? Simple, being able to upload custom gamer pics from your phone, making it easy to customize any time you wish.

Maybe working from home isn’t a productive model after with the Microsoft team that worked on this app, considering this is the full release of a Microsoft application, effectively synonymous with the release of the new Xbox....how disappointing 

I think it’s also important to note that letting us know “What’s new” isn’t a very good distraction from all the features that were taken away, the features we grew accustomed to using, and the features that gave us a reason to open the Xbox app in the first place. 

My opinion- bring back the old app. Host this one with a separate name, maybe slap a (Beta) flag on there to let us know how incomplete it is. Don’t advertise this as a fully functional application. It’s just flat out disrespectful to the customers, and worse it’s creating a bottleneck in a system where we used to seamlessly and successfully interact with our Xbox profiles and social elements, but now are now left to our own devices.

One function that me and my family use regularly has really suffered from this update - the remote control function (formerly SmartGlass). 

Occasionally, when using the remote function the app will freeze and soon after it will crash. Even more frustrating, is the loss of responsiveness when using this feature. The old app did a great job being responsive and registering button taps and swipes. The new app regularly doesn’t register different inputs and when it does there is a clunky, noticeable lag before the console reflects the input. On top of that, the new UI now takes 2 buttons to get to the remote control when previously it was just one. Admittedly, that’s a pretty minor thing to complain about.

I came here as a result of Sony gutting Community (same as Clubs on Xbox) voice party chats in last week’s 8.00 update. I got this app to see if I might want to get a modern Xbox instead of a PS5. My daily routine for a long time, now, on a PS4, involved beginning a Community party chat as I began my day with friends and new aquaintances. With this app, I was beginning to explore Clubs and to make friends on Xbox. This app update stopped me cold, in my tracks.

The cons of this is when you are using this as a remote you are very very very limited to what you can do.

I would love to see an option where we can sign on to multiple Xbox accounts and seamlessly switch between them within the app. Please, for the love of God, revert the UI back to how it was before or close to it. But the way the app is right now is terrible. Highly backwards-thinking went into the development of this app and it’s recent updates.

I’m a busy guy and nothing is more frustrating then coming home after a long day at work, or just getting back from the gym, then having the console completely shut down. Sometimes a game will crash right before I get the chance to save. I understand that some games may just be ports from pc but, I don’t think that’s an excuse for it to happen with almost every game I play. Being someone who has played many games, I think your games should be thoroughly tested before ever even entering the Xbox store. Countless times have I been disappointed by games that I would love to play,  Only after spending my money on that game. I pay for Xbox live, the game pass, and occasionally I will buy a game.

The fact that it is an app on your phone is a huge upside that makes for an easy way to check in on you and your friends profiles. My favorite part about this app is that you can change your gamer pic. The only downside to this is that your file size has to be relatively large so some pictures won’t work. All in all, I would get this app. The positives are great and make Xbox chat much better along with 
being able to join Party’s from your phone. So if you are looking for any one of these things I would go ahead and install this app.";"2021-03-07T10:03:08-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=736179781&type=Purple%20Software";"736179781";133;"en";"POSITIVE"

Also there is no options anywhere that will let you even customize your profile anymore. The profile pics provided by xbox are terrible. It’s cool that you can remote play on your phone but is also a worthless feature. Who’s going to waste time trying to play a console game on a phone or tablet? You guys took away good things with your app to make it look “pretty”. Bad choice. 

Hopefully they change some aspects of this app to what they were. But I’m not holding my breath, game companies no longer care what the gamers think or want.

1. Sometimes, it doesn’t show anything in the friends page, as if I’m not signed in. It’s really quick to fix by just going to a random page then back to friends or restarting the app, but it gets annoying time to time.

2. In certain games, communication is one of the most important things you need to win, or just to talk, but you can’t do that when the app decides to stop and take a bite of his Hot Pocket. After talking for about 30 min - 1h, the app does just that, so what I’m trying to say is; one of you people that work for Microsoft, if you see this, hold the Hot Pocket over the app’s mouth and fix the prob.

3. Most of the time, the app simply just yeets out of existence (closes the app on itself). This happens either when #2 happens, and I go back into the app to join back, or it just happens when I simply go in.

Sometimes when sending, reading, or opening messages, I’ll randomly get a crash, as well as just opening it.

2. Not being able to join parties hosted by those who aren’t on my friends list.
I love the “Looking for Group Posts” Feature in this app, but it would be amazing if it’d let me actually JOIN the party rather than get an error, when researched says something about “Privacy”, which is wrong because everything is as it should be.

3. Features being “Blocked”
Some features such as

 3b. Joining Friend’s Parties
 3c. Viewing my own Profile

Second, the tap targets on the player controls are too small. I have to tap the tiny little full screen button, and I tend to mis-tap several times before getting it because the control is so tiny.

Third, the sound on the video is tied directly to whether the device’s silent switch is toggled. I use my phone in silent mode almost all the time, yet I have to flip the switch in order to hear the video. This is not the case for most other apps. Generally when I press volume up while a video is playing, it unmutes. 

Overall very good app but a few quality of life usability improvements would make it a lot better.";"2021-03-07T09:40:38-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=736179781&type=Purple%20Software";"736179781";178;"en";"POSITIVE"

Lately there have been issues with the keyboard not appearing at all, rendering the app useless for me. Fixing that alone won’t make it as good as it can be though.

The remote app could be made much better by taking advantage of iOS rich notifications for sending a notification when the keyboard opens on the Xbox One, with text entry from directly from the notification.

I didn’t think it was possible to be THIS user hostile. They’ve removed your ability to change and upload custom gamer pictures, edit your profile, and save game clips and screenshots. 

Oh, and did I mention they also removed the Activity Feed, as well as the store? Yeah, they did that too. Which begs the question as to why they even added a search bar in the first place! If you can’t purchase anything from the app, nor search up players that aren’t your friends, what’s the point in the app to begin with now?

Looping back to the gamer picture situation, you technically still CAN use custom pictures, but that’ll require you to download the app on your PC, or use a USB drive and connect it with your console. Yeah, more hoops to jump through, when the previous version of the app was just fine. 

Bravo, Microsoft. Bravo. You somehow managed to make your app worse, by taking away your users freedoms, and somehow being even more user hostile than ever before.

Ever since the most recent update I have had so many problems with this app. First of all one of my friends I can talk to for about 30 seconds before he cuts out, and it goes for everyone in the party. Another problem is that the app crashes way more than it should. The previous update I would have 1-3 crashes a month and now it’s 5 a day. Then also the app will just kick me out of parties but for some reason still let me talk to people. Let me explain, the app will say for other people [PRIVATE] had been kicked from the party and for them I will no longer appear in the party if the check the party, but for some reason they can still hear me and I can still hear them. If I try to leave the party and join back in afterwards the app will crash on me, keep in mind this happens every time I use party chat, meaning the app almost always crashes on me.

So to summarize.

Hopefully the Microsoft team will revert or add a new system for profile picture customization, but until then this app lost all of it’s purpose to me.";"2020-11-09T09:35:05-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=736179781&type=Purple%20Software";"736179781";119;"en";"NEGATIVE"

The second reason is that it’s not as clean as you would expect from a tech giant like Microsoft. What I mean by that is that it just feels messy when navigating around, for example the settings page just has words everywhere and it’s not very organized.

2) The store. Holy moly its bad. What happened? Where it go? Now I have to search and try to find the game. Cant gift a game. Cant see trailers. No prices on anything. No sales alerts. No sale section. No top games. Whats going on?! Are you guys trying to sell games? All you guys have a is a small selection on the bottom of the home screen. Not great.
3) Messages are great. Love the new chat. The new library section is cool to see all the games but again, why no stats or showing any achievements with this info? Captures are great and easy to use to download.

1. Party chat audio. When joining a party via your phone on the app, other players’ audio cuts out (or my own audio) and I’ve tested this to eliminate variables to determine it’s the Xbox App’s problem and not the other players in the party.

2. Playing game clips. When scrolling through a friends feed to watch a clip, upon tapping it and trying to watch it, it always loads for a ridiculously long time and then when it does play, it often pauses automatically by itself to load more, and often never resumes. This is really annoying, and thus makes it almost impossible to view clips via the Xbox App.

Xbox PLEASE FIX THESE ISSUES ASAP! Thanks!

Don’t remove them when you go through a UI restructure. Just don’t.

As of this new update of the XBox app, users can no longer:

Browse and purchase content through the store.

See available XBox Live Gold Games and download them.

Track and compare achievements. 

Edit profile information.

I wonder what was going on in the heads of the people responsible for usability, creation and maintenance of this app of which they are clearly not users. I also wonder how many people on the team disagreed with this update and knew the backlash that would ensue.

Well, here it is.

They’d be wise to put back the things that users clearly “used” before the launch of the Series X/S and run focus tests with actual users of the app next time they want to go all hack-and-slash with features.

Lastly, I wonder how much revenue has been lost since the launch of the app because people can no longer make easy impulse purchases on the app to download to their system for later use.";"2020-10-24T21:55:03-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=736179781&type=Purple%20Software";"736179781";199;"en";"POSITIVE"

Firstly, I cannot stress this enough—DO NOT CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD! If you do, you won’t be able to get back into the app. You’ll just keep signing in again and again with no hope of an end. This applies for both game pass and the Xbox App. 

Messages are NOT updated off of notifications and some messages are missing altogether. When clicking on a notification, you may not see the message in the app itself, etc. All in all, really stressing and terrible.

The device mirroring feature (playing it on your phone/tablet) works great. It’s just a few seconds behind. If you can fix it to where it’ll change at the same time, i’ll use it more.

It does not have the same features it used to (significantly less) and is not easy to navigate.

I cannot access my Xbox account or system settings via my app anymore and the remote/keyboard no longer pops up when I go to message someone on my system, therefor always leaving me to stumble through the already awkward new design to look for my chats.

It takes way longer to boot up and load peoples messages and profiles. No longer can you look through a persons feed and save their videos or even like/comment. The ease of use has simply plummeted and I don’t find it convenient in the slightest. If anything, it’s a hassle and I usually avoid using it if I can. It is still the fastest way to message people via typing but losing that connectivity like it used to have is a real bummer.

The new Xbox app is a classic case of “if it ain’t broken, don’t ‘fix’ it!” It’s a shame it lost so much of what made it convenient.

Bring back the complete integration of the Xbox dash board. I can no longer access the Microsoft Store as to buy games and have them downloaded straight to my console.
