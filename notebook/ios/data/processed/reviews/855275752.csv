They wanted me to get a device and measure my BP.  I didn’t know how really and didn’t want something that would take long to complete.  I found this device and app and really love it.  It’s very quick to use so it does not take time (I’m more likely to take my BP more often) and the recording / tracking is the best part bc it automatically records then shows me not only the results but how good or bad they are with a quick graph.  And the accumulated data is, of course, great to see over time.   
It’s very easy and most importantly quick to use.  So, I desire to use it and am more closely following and rectifying my BP.

First of all, throughout the last 18 months of owning Qardiobase 2, it has been nominally reliable, with spats of problems. All of a sudden, the scale will be off by 10+ lbs, consistently the same amount, and then a reboot of the scale will fix it. This is annoying and undermines trust of the product and brand, but I’ve dealt with it by going into the app and deleting those data points. Today, it started giving me wild results, but when I went into the app to delete the data, that no longer works. So I tap delete, but the data point remains. I had to go into Health app to delete multiple data types, and still the scale is registering me as a different member of the household, with no way to correct it. I do not feel this product is stable enough to be used as a tool for health and fitness. I regret the purchase and I’m ready to move on.

Update: I have done a system reset of the scale and it appears to be working again. I’m still frustrated, but at least my problem has been resolved for the time being. I feel the app does many extraneous things that I don’t use, and would prefer the development team spend their time focusing on stability of the core features like weighing and storing the results.

Additionally, I have corresponded with their customer service through email, they were responsive, acknowledging my concerns but in the end offered no solution.  As time passes I keep hoping I’ll see an app update in the iTunes Store but thus far I have seen nothing.  In fact I find no history that they ever do any corrective updates.

In regards to the QardioArm, I question the accuracy of its measurements. I have watched all the how-to videos and use as directed. However, I can get five wildly different readings sitting in the same position. It doesn’t seem to be able to correctly read my pulse, and frequently (4 out of 5 times) gives me an “irregular heartbeat” warning. This caused enough of a scare to share the data with my cardiologist. After wearing a Holter monitor for a week, there were no signs of irregular heartbeat.

1) The scale displays one weight and the app sync shows another. It's usually 0.1 pounds different but that should not be the case.

2) When I started with the Qardio Base2, I was dehydrated as I rarely drink any beverages. For a week now I've been hydrating well but my water composition percentage remains the same (49-50%). I'm not sure if this is more reflective of the app or the scale. 

3) When I step on the Qardio Base2 scale, three times immediately back-to-back, I get 3 different readings for weight.

4) The app shows a history tracker chart for weight, BMI, and body fat %.  Because the scale and app both show figures for water and bone composition, it would be nice to view those charts as well. There currently is no option for that. Suggestion: allow a toggle that can show two or more charts together for comparison.

I like the app's potential but more is needed. Part of the problem could be with the scale so I'm hoping the app might have an update for me to try before I decide to return the Base2 scale.

Our institution purchased several QARDIOARM and QARDIOBASE devices to evaluate the potential for large scale remote monitoring.

Although we found the accuracy of these devices to be excellent, the reliability of this app was dismal.

Several participants reported that they could not log into the app. We were told the app would not accept their passwords, and even after changing their passwords they could not log into the app or Qardio web site. Several that chose to use TouchID or FaceID on their devices kept receiving error messages saying “bad credentials.” We were told that several also tried to contact Qardio and then received emails appearing to be from Qardio but originating from unrelated addresses.

The inability of individuals to log into this app and have their critical information recorded and sent to us, such as blood pressure measurements in high risk individuals, presents an unsafe situation.

At this time, we cannot support use of this app or any devices associated with it, until Qardio corrects the unreliable password credential process used to try to login into this app.

I have Apple Health integration turned on in the Qardio app settings and given Qardio permission to write data into Apple Health. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, Qardio Base 2 data does not appear automatically in Apple Health – the only way to get it to show up is to toggle “Integrate with Apple Health” off and on in the Qardio app settings, followed by toggling on and off the “Weight” option in Apple Health/Sources.

The product and its clever design earned admirers at my doctor’s office when I went in for a check. They’d never seen such a seamless integration with a smartphone. 

I completely recommend Qardio products because of their advanced design and the company’s commitment to your satisfaction.

Back to the actual software. It’s laggy when large amounts of blood pressure data are saved. Scrolling then takes much effort — even on the new iPhone X! Some colored icons on the left side of the blood pressure data screen is hidden because the rendering of the software has been pushed slightly off screen, making for some awkward viewability issues.

Fit Bit’s Aria works with or without the app AND uploads...then you can view online or in the app. My Qardio Base2 just smiles at me if I try to use it without the app. As for accuracy...it is very close to the Aria’s measurements. 

For the Qardio Arm...  my arm is 16.5”, which is outside their specs. It still works fine and is often accurate. I would imagine if you have smaller arms, it works great every time. 

For the App...great look and feel with useful information. Since there is no cloud storage and given neither device functions properly without the app and its direct connection to the device...it is the killer to an otherwise great idea. 

Overall...do yourself a favor (and save $$) and wait for a later version of this app and hardware. There are MANY better, more mature offerings out there.";"2017-10-28T07:14:02-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=855275752&type=Purple%20Software";"855275752";162;"en";"POSITIVE"

This monitor has several great features, my favorite is the option to store daily heart and blood pressure results. When I went to my last cardiovascular exam I took my Qardio monitor and was able to show my personal physician my crazy blood pressure readings with the Qardio app on my cell phone, which helped him evaluate the need for additional prescriptions. The attending nurse loved my monitor so much that she decided to buy one for her father. Other features of the Quardio blood pressure and heart monitor app are: a place to write a brief note about what contributed to your reading result, an option to allow another person to use your monitor without interfering with your personal results, scale readings for your blood pressure or heart readings, alarm option to remind you to check your blood pressure or take medication, a waves heart emoji when your heart isn't beating normally, and a place where you can enter contact information allowing your Qardio app to call your physician or caregiver or family member if you are having health issues. With this app you can send all of your monitor readings to your personal physician by phone. You will appreciate the fact that you can contact the makers of this app through the app to make suggestions or report problems.
