I can also leave on any light and turn them off from my bed before I go to sleep. Leaving a distance  ambient light on while cruising through the house on the way to bed, not disturbing my partner with a bright light in the bedroom.
The verdict is still out as to whether they will work from somewhere else around town or from somewhere else  in the country.
I felt that set up was a little difficult. Both my husband and I have droid phones. I also have an I-Pad & a computer. I set the program up on all of the devices. They were all working. Then this morning, my husband was unable to access the program. It seems a little too temperamental. I put a new device on another lamp last night. It came up on my phone and I pad right away.  But he can’t access the program now on his phone.  So I’ll have to fool around with it, again for the 5th or 6th time. They should all sync together. Nothing has changed with our phones or the internet.  I downloaded the program to all the devices. So I don’t know what the problem is with that.

Began with one light switch and, although getting the switch detected and connected was wonky, the light worked great with rules. Over time I added more switches and currently there are 6 Wemo devices at my residence. The advertised benefit of Wemo items is to (1) set up rules for devices to turn on/off automatically and (2) for remote access. 

(1) For the last year+ the “rules” do not work if I am not home. Forget having your home appear like someone is home when you are not. (2) Remote access also does not work if I am not home. What good is having a remote access function if it does not allow you to access your devices remotely? I have started from scratch and followed every trouble shooting method Belkin suggests any I have to now advise that Wemo is a failure. This was not always the case. Historically remote access worked flawlessly. No more. If I’m at the corner or on the Indian continent Wemo doesn’t work.  

I have earnestly tried to be a devoted, long term customer, but that has changed. Last night I tried to turn on the front door light from a nearby restaurant and the app updated to show each 6 Wemo devices “not detected.” Simply said, the Wemo app does not work remotely, which means these expensive Wemo light switches and plugs are worthless. Thankfully I have still have old fashioned timers to plug lights in to because these expensive Wemo gadgets don’t work.";"2019-05-06T16:08:28-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=511376996&type=Purple%20Software";"511376996";260;"en";"POSITIVE"

As soon as I find something I don’t like about a product, I’m on to the next brand. Customer service and a brand that actively listens to customers are the only 2 things which will have me reconsider.

That being said, I got my first WeMo, a dimmer light switch about a year ago, maybe a little more than a year, I forget, but it has spoiled me so badly for other light switches due to one little option. The ability to set rules. In my case I have a rule set up to turn the light off 30m after it’s been turned on. This allows me to essentially walk out of my bedroom and not have to ponder whether I’ve turned the light off or not. It’s enough time to walk in and out of the room to do things too. There’s been a boom of WiFi light switches and dimmers but believe it or not, WeMo software remains the only one capable of this. 

My only issue is that things have been flawless up until 1.22.x. Now the switch ever so often becomes “not detected” and oddly, while I can turn it on or off with Alexa, it loses all other functions like dimming and rules/timers etc. The only fix I’ve found is rebooting my phone.

Then if I’m successful in getting my network, as soon as I put in my password it tried connecting for about 20 seconds and then the app crashes. Every single time!!!!! Good luck getting the app to reload after that. It just keeps saying connecting. I bought these the same day as I bought a Nest thermometer for my house. I had the Nest wired into where my existing thermostat was, set up and connected to my WiFi, and working with Alexa for voice temperature control seamlessly in about 30 minutes. I worked with these “smart” switches for about an hour and a half before I gave up, raging that something that simple could be so poorly made and not work a single time I tried.

In 2017, I built a new home. I have twenty Wemo devices. They were east to install and program. My biggest problem was poor internet connectivity. Once I resolved my internet issues, they have worked well. I have all the features active, from schedules to sunset to sunrise and connected to Alexa. I do keep my firmware updated too. I have noticed that on some occasions, I don’t see a few devices. In the app, top left corner, there is a refresh or check button. Once I hit that button, it checks all devices and they all appear. Is it a flawless product? No, but what it does do and how it actually works is so very cool. Just think about the automation control via Alexa. I control lights, ceiling fans and shop tools.

I precook the thighs in a bit of olive oil. Then dice some carrots, potatoes and water chestnuts. I dissolve a half a package of the 8.4 ounce package in some heated water then add it to the veggies and chicken. Make sure you have enough water to Marie than cover your stuff. Then set to low. You can watch the progress on your WeMo app. I let mine cook for at least 8 hours. Then I add more curry blocks until it thickens to a thick consistency. Serve it over white Japanese short grain rice and wallah! 

I have the WeMo light switches, 5 so far. I have all the outside lights like driveway hooked up. I actually hired an electrician to install them. I believe they only work for single pole switches. Another words if a light can be turned off or on at two different switch, the WeMo won’t work. And WeMo customer support is awesome and patient.

I had to perform complete factory resets of each wemo plug at least four times, not to mention network resets, and hard phone reboots.  Per Belkin’s instructions, I literally deleted and reinstalled the wemo app several times for each switch.  The real tragedy is that whatever convenience and time saving I may realize with these switches will NEVER add up to the amount of time I wasted setting them up.  They aren’t inexpensive; they’re cheap.  I’m only wasting more of my own time on this review so that others don’t have to.  Understand that at the end of the day, these are just on/off switches.  They can’t even act as dimmers.  If you’re thinking of buying this, then do yourself a favor first: stand in front of your light switch and turn it on and off, over and over, for an hour, and count the number of cycles.

Overall they worked fine afterward. A bit slow in response, sometimes like 7 seconds after I toggle the switch. About a week ago I’ve updated to a new router(new network name and password) and from there plugs just stopped to work from the app. One of them still somehow works through Apple Home App. Another one does not. No matter what I’ve tried it does not pair again. The most terrible part of the reconnection story was that both plugs appeared as publicly connectable WiFi point couple of hours after my old route was disconnected from the power. Anyone can connect to them and attempt a new setup. WeMo plugs cost a bit more than alternatives, I was fine to pay a bit extra for what I hoped can be a good user experience. My experience with these plugs is 2 starts out of five - they work, but I expect stable work from smart home gadgets.

I still am not able to connect the switch to my Apple home kit as their firmware update has caused more issues than any good. I have tried uninstalling & resetting to factory default.

I had to go back through the entire set up again to only get to the app shutting itself down several times again. Finally getting it to work but still not with home kit.

That, however, is also problematic because the rules cannot be changed when the device is not connected to the internet. Which brings us back to problem one again. I am also annoyed that one of the reasons I purchased these particular plugs is because they were advertised to work well with Apple home and Alexa. Alexa is hit or miss (probably due to their connection issues). And ever since I had to manually reset all of my plugs (following tech support suggestion) because the plugs had stopped following the rules and were coming on and off at weird times, they no longer are connected to Apple home.

The minis will connect to the network and then the app will lose connection to all of the devices and fail. I am very disappointed and unhappy with this whole set up at this point. Not only that there’s a section to report a problem in the app that malfunctions as well and won’t send the report to them.

I like the feature for pre-programming control of my lights. I set the lights to be on at dusk so that the house is lit up when I arrive home after dark and also so the house has a lived-in look when I’m not home.  The process used for programming when to turn lights on & off is intuitive and easy.  Changing the on/off times, such as for shifting the on time later or earlier, is particularly easy.  

I love that I can quickly turn lights on & off from my phone anytime I have an Internet connection.  I use that capability on days when I get up before sunrise.  I then use my ever-present phone to turn on a light for my stairway and also one in my kitchen so I have a well lit route to my kitchen even before I start walking.  I also use the capability when I’m away from the house, such as on vacation, to randomly turn on & off lights to give my house a truer lived-in look than is provided by the lights controlled by on/off timers, i.e., more variety/randomness. 

I am particularly impressed with how Belkin provides updates to the WeMo software.  The updates are usually for making the system more secure from outsider snooping or attacks.

First I needed a way to turn on my front porch light at night when it was dark and I was coming home from work. It was too dark to see the keyhole for my door key. I tried so many other things. Nothing worked. I got a Wemo light switch and was hooked! I can either set the light to turn on at Sunset or manually turn it on via my phone app. 

Then I got one for my bedroom ceiling fan. When I’ve been sick in bed it’s so nice not to have to get up to constantly turn it on and off. 

Then my son kept leaving lights on around the house. I can check all the wemo lights status on my phone app and turn them off if I need to. 

My favorite use is a Wemo outlet plug in. I connected my coffee maker to it. I set up the coffee at night. When I wake up I turn it on via the Wemo app. By the time I get downstairs the coffee is ready. I set the timer to turn the coffee pot off after 30 minutes 

I connected Wemo light switches to all the bathroom fans. I set a timer so when you turn the fan on the countdown starts. Wemo turns the fans off after 15 minutes.

I also use them for all the indoor Christmas decorations. All the decorations are on a timer, but I can also manually turn them on/off via the app.";"2020-06-11T06:35:50-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=511376996&type=Purple%20Software";"511376996";272;"en";"POSITIVE"

Currently they come on at sundown when scheduled and then shut off within an hour. We then have to manually turn them on and off after that for the night.

I’ve got Echo Dots and Philips Hue Lights at home and those devices go through a similar set up (connect to the device’s WiFi, then get redirected to your normal WiFi).

I read some of the other reviews about the set-up and use of the Wemo Minis, and I cannot agree with those who say it is either hard to set up and/or use once installed.

I bought three 2-packs from Costco and had set-up four of the six plug/switches, using just my iPhone and app, before I realized there were written instructions included in each pack.  

Install for 6 plug/switches took
Less than 30 minutes total.  It was very intuitive, and the Wemo app did a great job walking me through each install and set-up using my home's existing wifi network.

As far as use goes, I did not experience any of the problems some users have encountered with slow response or delays turning on and off lights.  My guess is they are having issues with either their smart phones or the speed and durability of their wifi networks not the Wemo products.

Now, I have the ability to turn my lamps on remotely from anywhere in the world, run independent on-off schedules for each, and turn lights on before entering or after leaving a room.  Very convenient.

My other favorite is you actually go into the Wemo app and it shows a light turned off. However, you are sitting there looking at the light and it is turned on.

Power or internet outages temporarily disrupt the system but it quickly comes back online without intervention. Even in cases where the app is not working on the phone, the preset schedules seem unaffected.  Being able to automate lights when you are away is also helpful. 

We use for certain lights in the house, both switches and outlets. We have our outdoor lights running which is probably the most helpful feature. Then our Christmas lights also run off the Wemo, both the tree off the Wemo plug and then outdoor plugs controlled by Wemo switches. 

Despite some bugs, it works and if something doesn’t work the first time, try a few more times

An ideal upgrade is the ability to change the WiFi globally - meaning without having to change each individual plug or switch manually. It is fairly straightforward, but still takes time if you have built up your Wemo arsenal as many people do over time.  I do have the Gen 1s, so maybe later versions are improved. Overall, satisfied and will continue to selectively invest. I would caution against over-installing.

The Wemo mini and wemo insight all works as it’s described but there much more functions that can be utilized from the insight. 

The mini software works fairly well and takes a few minutes and tries for it to make sense. It’s not very intuitive. But it works once you figure it out. 

The insight is meant for monitoring energy usage. It would be better if the software had more features to actually track the data. If it could collect and store eneery use, allow the user to see the usage over a period of time, change the date ranges that the energy is used, when then energy usage is totalized, see over a period of (a day. A week. Or a month), and input values so the user can change the price per kw so it can match his/her utilities time frame and cost. This would make the insight much more worth it. 

It look like the app is working for the insight but I’m not sure where it’s getting its cost numbers from and I don’t know if the energy use is accurate since I can’t see when the energy totalizing started and ended.

Over the last 3 years it’s been a different story. The app has gone downhill, firmware “updates” are more like performance downgrades. 3 things make Wemo completely unacceptable in today’s world.
1. Changes to WiFi network require users to start over from scratch and basically reinstall each device.
2. The setup process is a joke. If you get lucky enough to connect to the Wemo device, you’ll still spend countless attempts doing it over and over as you try connecting it to your home Wi-Fi. The app constantly fails.
3. If you want to use the app on another device, it requires you to redo the setup process. Yes, after the headache of doing it once and FINALLY getting them online, you have to take a device offline/reset it and start over. Not just search for them or pull a setup from your account. That is a complete joke and the biggest waste of time in smart home history.

So as you can see, everything you do or change requires a full setup. Oh, and if you get a device online, at least 50% of the time it will show as missing or not found.

* Wemo Mini Smart Plugs experience issues reconnecting to WiFi after power outage.  I’ve noticed recently that my smart plugs are having issues reconnecting to the WiFi.  In order to reconnect, I have to unplug each smart plug and plug them back in to resolve.

Rules are no longer in sync when having the Wemo app on multiple devices.  The issue seems to be with how Belkin/Wemo is saving the rules in the cloud.  When a rule/several rules are deleted on one device (iPhone), the rule reminds on the other device (iPad).  When deleting from the iPad, the deleted rules reappear on the iPhone.  This occurs even when done in reverse.  Recreating the rules doesn’t resolve the issue as the new rules will only remain if you don’t delete the old rules.  If the old rules are deleted, all the previous rules reappear and the new rules are gone again.";"2021-01-18T09:55:09-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=511376996&type=Purple%20Software";"511376996";152;"en";"POSITIVE"

I’ve read that some people have had luck using Apple HomeKit/Google Home– I’ve had no luck with either. HomeKit can’t even find it — even though the lights indicate that it’s not only on, but connected to a WiFi source — and neither can my Google Home app. I’ve also read on here that people are experiencing firmware issues, which part of me can’t help but think that might be contributing to my problems, but I haven’t had it for a long time so I’m giving Wemo the benefit of the doubt there.

I’ve tried restarting my phone, the app, reinstalling the app, restarting the plug, etc. Nothing.

Honestly I’ve been a fan of Belkin / Wemo for quite a while, but the only reason that second star is there is because I’ve only had the device for 1 day. Unfortunately that day was spent fighting with this “smart” plug, and thus, the low rating.

Now I cannot do anything in the app because I do not have an account.  Their competitors do not require an account to setup their devices and add to HomeKit.  So why does Wemo?  So I guess this is trading one privacy concern for another.  So maybe the app no longer requires location services (can’t test) but now you have to have a Wemo cloud account.  

Original review:
The app will not function without location services enabled.  They claim this is required which is false.

They work fine as long as there is no power fail or interruption on the WiFi network. I have to always redo the configuration after a power fail or a loss of WiFi network. They don’t just re-establish connection after power or network is restored.

Pro: it works as advertised.
Cons: can only handle one location. With the new smart plug, which I installed yesterday, it needs the Apple Home to activate the plug before you can add it to the Wemo App. Why?

Do Not buy Wemo products. I will just let my Wemo outlets die and replace with other tech, like Insteon, which I also have and working in two locations that I can manage with one Inateon App.

Update May 30, 2020: I was surprised when I opened the Wemo app today, it was asking for a login so I tried my login but it failed. So I said what the heck, I’ll create my an account and entered my usual account info that I had been using and it took it! Then I reset the smart plug so I can re-add it to Wemo, and bypass Apple Home Kit.

First of all, I had to put a WiFi hub about 10ft away from it so it wouldn’t lose connection. This is likely due to the switch being installed in a metal switch box. If the box were a plastic one, I suspect it would work a bit better. But metal is the standard, so WeMo really should think of a solution. The switch also hangs after pretty much every brown out and can’t be rebooted via the reset button. The only thing that works is flipping the breaker to off for 30 seconds, then restore power again. Which is a hassle because of the location of the breaker panel. 
Lastly, after the recent update, the switch turns off an hour earlier than it is supposed to. It appears it “forgot” the rule for daylight saving time. 
The minis, on the other hand, have been fairly reliable. The switch also has given me little trouble.

Maybe the new ones that have HomeKit out of the box work well. I don’t know, because I only have 2 Insight switches, and 2 Minis. And both are just a ridiculous, painful mess to set up. 

And if your WiFi goes down for a second? Almost every other device I have manages to reconnect, as soon as it’s back, because that’s just what a half decent piece of internet-connected hardware does. 

These things, however? It’s a complete coin toss. Sometimes they come back up, and sometimes they just stay in some kind of stuck state, where they work only if you press the button manually, and can’t be used from the app — which is about as useful as not having a smart switch at all. 

That means we have to go back to the Stone Age of having to get out of bed before turning off the floor lamp, which while probably not the worst thing in the world, is sort of the exact problem that Wemo was designed to solve. 

And then you have to set them up all over again, which, see above, could be seen as a cruel and unusual punishment.";"2020-05-17T21:48:31-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=511376996&type=Purple%20Software";"511376996";229;"en";"NEGATIVE"

In the years that I have tried to get WeMo to work, this app has always been a problem. Also, any time there is a device firmware update you have to do a complete reset to get things connected again.

1.  Whenever there is a power failure, or the router the devices are connected to reboots, ALL of the Insights drop from the wireless network and FAIL TO RECONNECT on their own.  Instead, I have to manually go through the process of setting up each Insight all over again, and until I do, I cannot access them to control the lights!  Not very practical if I’m away at the time of a power failure, not to mention the fact that manually reinitializing that many devices is TIME CONSUMING.

2.  The WEMO app itself only allows you to control devices attached to a SINGLE wireless network.  So in my case, where I was hoping to use the Insights at 2 different residences, I CAN’T!!

Now, you would think the folks at Belkin / WEMO would be interested in correcting these concerns - the first likely doable by a firmware update and the second by a modification to their app - but apparently not.  I’ve tried reaching out to them numerous times, and have received NO response at all.  POOR customer support to say the least.

I had no other option to add my device, so I went ahead and did it.

Now only 3 of my existing 6 devices work as well as they did 2 days ago. 2 work in HomeKit and the Wemo app but don’t work with 3rd party integrations, and the other one I decommissioned to replace with one of the new ones. Of the 2 new ones I’ve added, 1 works in HomeKit and the Wemo app but not with 3rd party integrations, and the other one initially worked with HomeKit but now shows as offline and only works in the Wemo app.

Reliability is by far the most important thing for smart plugs, and Wemo’s recent updates and switching to the cloud accounts nobody asked for have completely destroyed that. With a hitrate of 2/9, there is no way they even tested these features before rolling them out.

I don’t give 1 star reviews lightly. This is not a case of “I’m angry about a new update so I’m giving 1 star.” This is a fair assessment of the quality of using this app with these devices.

It’s now 10:00pm and I just finished. The app crashed about 11 times the last 3.5 hours, I have an iPhone 10x, so I’m not on a startac or something.

It works now but 2 stars off for Belkin making us jump through all these hoops without instructions.

I decided to try from my phone. The app again wanted to install a firmware update. I again installed it, to no effect. 

I called Tech Support. After 36 minutes on hold, I opted for the call-back. After another 20 minutes, I got a call back, and was immediately on hold again. I gave that 7.5 minutes before giving up, having never spoken to an actual human. 

In the meantime, I’d gone into the WEMO app and manually initiated a third firmware update. After that, the malfunctioning Smart Plug began to function normally again, no thanks to WEMO Tech Support.

When Apple home kit released I was excited that WeMo was making a Homebridge to adapt WeMo to the iOS ecosystem.

That was a dismal failure. 

Homebridge frequently dropped devices and the WeMo app started going downhill at this time as well. 

I found the only WeMo devices with any stability were the ones branded with HomeKit compatibility.   They connect through iOS HomeKit and you can ignore the flaky and crash-prone WeMo app. 

Until you need to apply an update to a WeMo device.

I have tried deleting caches, deleting apps, etc. but the app still fails to push through an update. 

I am very disappointed in belkin regarding WeMo. I really liked and promoted their products for years.

I have over a dozen Wemo devices in my house so I’m stuck in a bad marriage here. Sometimes it works, but I cannot get it to reactivate any devices anymore (I’ve tried everything suggested in support articles), and half of the devices are “not there” according to the app. Any time I open the app to try to control a device, it realizes it isn’t actively connected to any of them and it goes through 5+ mins of refreshing cycles before it finds the devices again.

Since I’m not going to throw away hundreds of dollars of Wemo devices, I can only wait until Wemo gets its act together and gets the app to actually work.

1. Before I add new Wemo devices to our network I must first disable the 5 GHz radio on our wireless router. These things only connect to 2.4 GHz. When you read Belkin’s support articles on the subject it’s clear that they assume most people have different SSID’s (network names) for 2.4 & 5 GHz. However ours have the same name, as is widely recommended. This leads to me having to temporarily disabling 5 GHz. 

2. Programming the app can be a little odd. E.g. if you want to power something on from sunset to sunrise the next day, you have have to create two separate rules. This took a call to Support to finally figure out.

3. The general interface for changing settings is not intuitive to this user. But I’ve gotten used to it.

It sounds like they couldn't even get the account signup to work properly for many folks, which gives me great confidence that they have built a reliable and secure service.

I was able to unplug the Wemo and plug it back in to get it up and running again. But I have no access to configuration changes or firmware updates. If that doesn't fix it next time, it's going into the e-waste bin.

Also, I wanted these Wemo minis so I could remotely turn on my security cameras. However, when I finally got the Wemos to set up, the interference from the Wemos caused my security cameras to not work. They work fine when plugged directly into the wall but not if they are plugged into the Wemo.

My WEMO devices have been in service for nearly one year now. I have found all four switches supported by two different WIFI connections to perform flawlessly. 

I really utilize and appreciate the power and time monitoring feature as upgraded from previous remote switches that I have used. 

The WEMO product appears to update its Firmware more often than other wireless devices that I am familiar with. I credit the frequent updates with the product's reliability and my overall complete satisfaction.

I would highly recommend the WEMO INSIGHT SWITCH device for use with any reliable remote WIFI location in applications up to 1,500 watts at 120  VAC.

I hope Alexa will keep working to turn things off and on until they fix this — if they can.

Furthermore — their is NO WAY of contacting them.  No Customer Service info, phone or email.  Thus is the only way I can contact them—hopefully.  Who knows if anyone bothers looking at these reviews.

They have worked through outages, modem replacements etc. Still have the wemo plugged in, thought I would give it another try, but no go.
This is Belkin, and my router is netgear. I wonder if that is why some get it to work and other can’t. Not requiring a hub was the reason I bought it, but ended up having to buy a system with a hub. Hope they work the bugs out, could be a good product.
