Analog controls. If they would have added that option as physical buttons, hard reset pin hole?

By the time you get the connection if you lucky, you already moved onto something other than music. The thing it annoys me the most, is I can hear the frequency it emits, not a dead flat tone in the back of your head, even when the sound is off. I really wanted them for my room,

I will say I am using my phone to connect to the speakers. If you leave it connected to a more dedicated source. I.E. laptop it seems to work well.

It does not automatically reconnect after leaving range. That is just to use the speakers.

To control the lights, you have to download and open the Pulse app. Ok, no big deal. But if I want to turn on the lights, I have to go to settings > bluetooth, connect to the lights. Then I have to open the Pulse app (I usually wait 10 or so seconds before opening it, because I find if I open the app immediately after connecting to bluetooth, I end up waiting indefinitely), and then the Pulse app needs to do its own connection to the lights. From there, you can control the lights. Turning on the lights generally takes ~35 seconds (I timed it). To me, this is completely impractical as a primary light source in any space.

Only one device can be connected to the lights/speakers at any time, so if my husband wants to turn out his light while we're in bed, it can only be done on my phone.

Sound quality is decent for such a small speaker.
However, there are a few annoying features or limitations.
1). Every time you switch the bulb on, there is an audible beep for the speaker Bluetooth.  If you happen to turn in the light at night when someone is sleeping, even from another room it can be heard.  There is no option that I could find to disable this audible beep.  This should be fixable if Sengled were to choose to change this.
2). When you shut off the light switch, the last persons device that was connected to Bluetooth speaker remains ready to connect the next time the slight switch, preventing another family meme bet to connect unless the previous person deliberately disconnects their device before shutting off the switch.  I think this should be made an option in the app so that the owner can choose to administer the setting for last connected or next to connect.
3). The lightbulb has a warm white light in its default.  While the maker claims millions of colors are achievable, I have not been able to achieve a cool white white if 5000k to match the other regular LED bulbs that this Sengled bulb is installed on.  I think that this is a programming shortcoming that should be correctable yo be able to choose a cool white or warm white for default.

I hope that Sengled is paying attention to the ratings and comments and can fix these shortcomings, which in my opinion would I trade the rating to five stars.";"2019-10-20T12:48:25-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=840052462&type=Purple%20Software";"840052462";266;"en";"POSITIVE"

Controlling the speaker volume and light dimming is easy. Adding new speakers or a subwoofer is also straightforward. You don't need this app to use your Pulse lights, but it makes certain things easier. Volume and equalization can be controlled using whatever app you play music from. So the main uses of the Pulse app are controlling the light level, configuring new speakers, and setting the speakers to stereo or mono. It does these things well. 

The app is very simple. As the technology evolves, I'd like to see more features added. One missing feature that seems important is the ability to control the volume of individual speakers. I have the Pulse lights in a room with a sloped ceiling. So the lower ones seem much louder than the upper ones.

92;1466379864;"BlakeBrindle";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id36717170";"2.7.3";2;"Great Concept...  needs a little work";"The app can literally take up to one (1) minute to fully connect hardware once you select a product to control. There needs to be a way to ""bump"" a connected device if trying to connect a different device. Currently you have to disconnect (turn off) the ""Master"" device, turn off Bluetooth of connected device, turn the Master back on, then connect to the master through the Bluetooth of the other device. Just to dim a light?!...  there are 3 in household with iPhones and iPads for all. That's at least 6 devices that try to use the system. It can get very confusing. First world problems I know but usually you get what you pay for. A dimmer switch might be cheaper and more efficient. 

The device ""bluetoothing"" to the Master must be VERY close to the Master.  Don't venture to far  otherwise there is a lot of static. This is even when using an iPhone 7 Plus. So the device is not outdated as of 10/14/16. 

If some of these things could be addressed this would be a dream come true for whole home music and light control connectivity.";"2016-10-13T23:11:46-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=840052462&type=Purple%20Software";"840052462";191;"en";"POSITIVE"
