From the perspective of 10 years ago this is quite a cool thing. However, compared to other contemporary products it leaves a bit to be desired. For about the same price I can buy a Phillips Hue white and color ambience bulb. It will have similar color functionality plus the ability to act as a standard dim-able 60W bulb with white temperature selection. And most importantly, the Hue will integrate with HomeKit and respond to Siri voice control. The one unique feature of the Playbulb is the ability to remove it from its base and use it wirelessly. I can’t say I have used this feature much but it is the one thing that sets it apart. You really do get quite a bit more than you get with a Hue for the price though in most situations I would prefer a Hue. If they would just add HomeKit support it would make a world of difference. Additionally, the app could use some work in the design department so that it feels like a quality application and not something thrown together at the last minute. Lastly, the build quality of the device is quite good, though this is a review of the app and not the hardware.";"2018-01-17T07:03:22-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=911359856&type=Purple%20Software";"911359856";219;"en";"POSITIVE"

I’m begging you to add HomeKit and Siri control. The competitors seem to have that down. That would be a game changer for me. Ok onto the review... The bulbs are a bit delayed but that’s more of a hardware thing. The app is organized in a super weird way. I feel like the whole app could be redesigned in a more up to date and aesthetically pleasing way. The different features seem to be unorganized and very randomly placed. Instead of tapping settings to access ALL settings for that individual bulb, you only get the option to rename or reset it. Every other setting is located in its own very short menu. There’s a couple small things like when you open the menu, the only way to close it is that same button again. The problem is that it’s in a completely different and inconvenient spot at the top right of the screen. I know there are better/multiple ways to go about that. When I tap “group” there is always a solid white bar at the bottom of the screen. I’d also like a way to set any features for specific groups rather than having to select every bulb individually. I love having the option to dim lights, turn individual bulbs off, change colors and every other cool thing. I just think the app itself needs a full and complete revamp. I hope this helps at least a little.";"2018-06-27T00:32:33-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=911359856&type=Purple%20Software";"911359856";252;"en";"POSITIVE"

- white background is too bright and ruins the ambiance when adjusting in a dark room.

- Natural looking candle-flame color is nearly impossible. 

- generally only the solid color settings are consistent.  The color wheel is off... e.g., the yellow is green-tinged

- switching between effects and candle and regular is poor, colors are reset, the effects often do crazy ambiance-ruining things that are quite unexpected.

One CRITICAL feature missing is geolocation. The app should enable/disable the bulb based on proximity, that would be a great enhancement!

Another thing I'd like to see is notification alerts via the bulb. I'd like to choose the service, for example, SMS and have my bulb flash green for 2 seconds. Or Facebook and it flash blue for 2 seconds.

One last feature would be if the bulb could adjust the color throughout the day, similar to a service called f.lux for your phone. It adjusts your screen temperature to match the time of day so that in the night everything has a warm color temperature to go easy on your eyes.

Some suggestions: if it has a scene button, it should probably work, but it doesn't. The effects on the taptap options for settings should probably let you change the speed and the color of the effect, but it doesn't. Mipow should also look into making an option to preset colors that you like as your favorites so you can easily go back to them. These are very basic suggestions that I'm surprised aren't in the app in the first place. Seriously though, Mipow, if you're reading this, give the app to someone who knows what they're doing, because it's seriously affecting your revenue.

The candle also switches between orange and red when I use the slider for a orange-red color on the candle setting. It should only flicker the color I picked. Also, the candle flickers on/off when the candle brightness is about 25%. It should flicker as nicely as when it's at 100%.

This app STILL stinks! It continues to crash. You cannot create new groups— it keeps telling me that the Group name has been taken… come again? Seriously! Without the app, the entire idea of having these candles work is simply a waste of time and money. 

Review from Dec. 4th

OK, I really like the candles you created which I got through Kickstarter but this app is a royal pain! 

First off, colors cannot be synched once grouped. Names (when changed) for individual candles do not show up correctly. I have 9 candles and it’s a mess to figure out which one I am trying to change the coloring on. Plus, whatever I change the color to does not get stored properly. 

Also, on a side note, you could have skipped on the scent disks as they smell artificial and not enticing at all. Better use of your resources would have been to make this app work 100%. I’d suggest to work on improving on the app! Having spend $99 on these candles now feels like a waste of my money.

I saw you moved on to the next project already. Do one thing well and put in your 100% before moving on. As a supporter, I feel cheated and will not support another one of your projects.";"2015-05-03T10:14:30-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=911359856&type=Purple%20Software";"911359856";226;"en";"NEGATIVE"

Whatever shortcomings the app may have with multiple lights--and there do seem to be a few, e.g. the ""group name already exists"" error--it works fine for me with just the one bulb, and Playbulb is a sleeker, cheaper alternative to Philips Hue...also apparently the only easily obtainable one here in Thailand.";"2015-08-07T23:41:14-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=911359856&type=Purple%20Software";"911359856";102;"en";"NEGATIVE"

I wanted to be able to set the bulb to slowly come on in the morning. The timer page shows a duration, but this does absolutely nothing - it just stays on whether I put in 1 min or 30 min.
