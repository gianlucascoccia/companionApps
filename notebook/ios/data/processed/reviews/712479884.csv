I will be the first to admit that keeping plants alive was a low priority in my busy life. However I made a commitment to keep a friends plants alive through the current growing season summer of 2017.
I had no clue the names of the plants that I was ""Plant sitting."" I watched the parrot flower power tutorial and by identifying the color of the leaves, indoors versus outdoors, the color of the blossoms and a few other basic questions I was able to correctly identify 4 plants correctly. Wow that step alone made me feel very confident about the plant flower power. Next I did the settings, moisture, sunshine, temperature. The plants are alive and well.

Where ever that is.  I got two flower power devices at my work USCellular on accessory day.  Not knowing how great this device is!!

It been kicking for 5 years still.  Never had a problem with it. I don’t like how some features were taken away with updates. Like the option you had once you watered or fertilizer your plant, you got to clear the notification on the flower power app, which I loved!! Now you can’t do that, plus worse part of it. Parrot had the brilliant idea to STOP making the FLOWER POWER!! When it’s a hot commodity on amazon or eBay! Brand new device $70!!! My sister paid!

However I’m going to give it some time to see if anything changes. I am in an apartment and using the device with a potted plant that has been a bit picky. Perhaps this device is better suited to someone with a larger garden with multiple plants to monitor.

Have experienced several issues so far:
•Every so often I will get a cloud analysis error message, that the server cannot be reached for data analysis. Seems to be fairly sporadic.
•I have yet to see any actual notifications from the app. It was my understanding that analysis would be performed in the background at certain intervals with the iOS device in range of the sensor, and notifications would be pushed to the iOS device. I only seem to receive new To-Do’s when I have the app open and am poking around.

Additional observations/recommendations:
• Ever since I have started using the device/app I have a constant To-Do to relocate the plant to an area with better sunlight. The plant is located by large west facing windows; this is the brightest spot within my apartment. Perhaps there should be a way to factor into the analysis the current season and location if not already. Obviously depending on location available light is going to be limited during certain seasons.
• There is no explanation of the number values for the  Y axis on both fertilizer and sunlight graphs. Would love to know what the unit of measurement is for both of these, as water uses a percentage and temperature uses Fahrenheit or Celsius measurements.
• The cloud synchronization animation (showing the data being collected by the Flower Power and uploaded to the “cloud” for analysis) could be slightly confusing for people… as the cylinder shape is easily recognized by people that understand IT/Systems but not the general public. Perhaps it could be beneficial to change the cylinder to a cloud shape and follow that paradigm.
• Would be great if the users account & information could also be accessed via a web app besides the iOS app.";"2014-01-05T12:16:56-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=712479884&type=Purple%20Software";"712479884";363;"en";"POSITIVE"

The pot however, worked great in the beginning, it was easy, my plant was doing really well, so I went and bought 5 more of these pots. For about a year no problems, then suddenly, one of my plants died, I took the pot apart and found that water from the holding tank leaked into the battery chamber causing the batteries to rust and explode, so my plant had a nice acid bath for who knows how long. I tried to get help from Parrot since this was clearly a design flaw, and they basically gave me the run around and in the end wouldn’t help me. Well, 6 months later, from the 6 pots I purchased, I now only have 1 that is still functioning and parrot refuses to do anything about it. In fact, I wrote reviews about the pot on amazon and their website and they had them all removed. Do not buy this product, at $150 pet pot, it’s a lot of money to spend to kill your plants. The app on the other hand, it works, I think...?
