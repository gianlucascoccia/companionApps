My family, pets and I feel safe away on trips and feel like we have a great prevention from break ins. With the low cost of the video storage for all of our video devices I am always aware of what goes on in or around my house at all times. I feel secure and never have any issues setting up, connecting or using their devices. They all integrate wonderfully and I could not be happier. I have recommended to many friends and family members to get just a ring video doorbell. As a new mom with dogs it was hard when anytime someone rang, packages, whatever, our dogs would wake our baby. Now with Chime, I set a tone that doesn’t illicit barking and am aware when anyone is at the door or rings the doorbell. The motion detection is amazing and really easy to customize to not get everyone hat walks by, or you can if that’s what you want. Absolutely love this company and their products. Every time they come up with something new I’m pleased with how well thought out it is and how well it integrates.";"2017-10-21T07:48:08-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=926252661&type=Purple%20Software";"926252661";219;"en";"POSITIVE"

I wish you would at least have the option of turning off the 10 minute timer that shuts down live view. Should be the customers decision to drain the battery in live view.  That’s why I bought an extra battery. Also, one of the times I tried calling you I was given the option of making an appointment for you to call me back but you never did. And Kaitlyn@Ring, don’t bother to paste your typical reply telling me to email you because you’re so concerned. I’ve read your response back to other customers so many times that I’ve memorized it. Customers should realize if you have to paste that same cookie cutter reply addressing everyone’s concern then Ring and your customers have a really big problem. I’m connected to my 2.4 GHz network and hitting roughly 8Mbps at -53 dBm power. Being an engineer I realize that the business unit and marketing/sales have more say than the technical staff at most companies. The technical people rarely want to release the product before it’s ready but the business side always makes that happen which is why your commercials on TV are so great but your product has a lot to be desired.

It had always sounded like a nice idea to be able to check who was at the door and I park on the street in front of our house so I could keep an eye on that as well. I think the only time motion is detected is when I walk walk out the front door myself or if a car drives by. I’ve had deliveries arrive and people knock on the door and there’s no motion detected and no recording in sight. Luckily the doorbell function seems to work (unless the battery is dead which is every other week) and I’ll never know who is at the door because of all the connectivity issues and super long waiting times to load the feed (even after upgrading the internet several times). Our neighborhood has had several instances of car parts stolen and even a break in at our neighbors and of course every time the battery has either been dead, no connection during the time it occurred to record, or simply no motion detected. Don’t even get me started on the online community! I shared a video I did catch of a strange man taking pictures of my neighbors house (two days before the break in) and was repeatedly called stupid and a terrible person for not calling the police despite the first sentence of the post stating the police had already been called and this was a warning to others that saw him in the neighborhood.

Whenever I’m alerted of motion or the presence of a person in front of my Ring camera, the recorded video of the incident is visible but never available/clickable. I can see this most recent recording on the history page, but it won’t open, yet all of the other recordings can be opened and played. I then have to close out the app that I had just opened and access the recording after that. This is a waste of time that could be dangerous if someone were trespassing on my property and looking to break in. I even made sure to download the update for the app, yet this problem still persists consistently. What is the point of having a security camera if I have to twiddle my thumbs and jump through hoops to watch the video that alerted me of the presence of unexpected motion? Being alerted at 3 a.m. of motion and then having to open and close the app a couple of times before knowing what triggered the alert is nerve-wracking. This needs to be fixed ASAP. We spent a lot of money on three Ring cameras, which are only as good as the software that comes with them.

I want to add that it takes forever to connect with the live view for one of my cameras, which makes that camera virtually worthless. I always have to walk to that side of the house and look out the window after receiving an alert about motion that was detected there.";"2020-06-11T04:26:54-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=926252661&type=Purple%20Software";"926252661";263;"en";"POSITIVE"

In fact, I have recommended Ring over other systems to friends and family many times. I have multiple AC powered only flood cams and doorbell cams around my property.  I have AC only cams because of the detail and flexibility in the configuration of multiple motion zones on these devices.  However, in a recent update, they removed the Active checkbox that allowed for the selection of one of multiple zones defined on a cam.  As a result, you must delete your other 2 motion zones when you need one of them active.  Then, when you want them back, you must redefine them!  Why is this an issue?  Let’s say you have cams looking down on a basketball court.  When the team is practicing, you do not need to record all activity.  Instead, you just want the area/zone around the court protected by your camera system.  If someone enters the zone, you want notified.  Otherwise, no alerts.  As someone who designs interfaces and software as a profession, I can tell you that this was an unforgivable decision.  You need to think long before ever removing a powerful feature that has been inherent for years.  For this reason, my experience with the app is now a frustrating experience.  I have since stopped recommending Ring.  I am now looking for another solution.";"2021-03-25T14:49:55-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=926252661&type=Purple%20Software";"926252661";235;"en";"POSITIVE"

This issue has been prevalent since a few months after we purchased. Any time I called customer service they would just have me run a reset and say it was working again and that there was nothing else they could do for me. Well finally a customer service person was unexpectedly helpful and had me do all sorts of tests to check how much power it was getting and come to find out it gets enough power, but there’s some sort of ‘fluke’ issue some of the doorbells have that prevent them from being able to operate all the time when the in-house chime is also activated. And wouldn’t it happen to be that we finally figured the cause of this problem out a few months after the warranty period expired. They were gracious enough to offer a discount on purchasing a new one, but if I didn’t want to buy another possibly faulty doorbell I would need to deactivate my internal chime, and just keep checking my app to see when it stops working so I can go home and perform another reset. I just got done with another reset because I realized today that my doorbell hasn’t worked for over a week. I would definitely not recommend this doorbell to anyone, and I will be searching for a replacement as soon as I finish posting this review.";"2019-07-18T20:16:57-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=926252661&type=Purple%20Software";"926252661";267;"en";"POSITIVE"

When you finally get a human on the phone and you explain that your device was stolen and the detective needs the serial number and the human tries to tell you where to find the serial number in your stolen device, you about lose it. She finally got it for me. Then I asked about the report that I filed with Ring to try to get a replacement device, she found it supposedly. I never got ANY response from Ring after I sent it in. None. After I got off the phone with the rep I got a customer service survey AND the same email that I had gotten before on how to file the report about a stolen device. Why did I get this? Do I have to fill it out again? Just write down your serial numbers.  With all of that said, I have to say that the app has gotten VERY SLOW. I used to love my Ring cameras over my Arlo ones. This has changed. The Arlo app is so much better and faster and you can easily flip through videos without closing one and opening the next or trying to keep a timeline from resetting to the end.

That’s another story. I haven’t used these cameras in the cold yet. We had a few  cold nights in the teens.  I thought maybe it was the cold so I brought them all inside, charged batteries for over 12 hours.  Even tho the website says operating temp is like 4°. But that’s the operating temp or the DEVICE. I’m wondering what the operating temp of the BATTERIES are. 
Installed everything again.  Solar panel still not charging battery. (I’ll deal with Wasserstein later). 
In all three products  the video is choppy and pixelating and slow. I cannot touch the screen to dismiss the onscreen controls. Nothing has changed in my WiFi settings. The router is in the same spot it’s been for four years. This seems to have started after the recent update.

Ring sent me a new ring doorbell as well as a chime extender. Very nice of them. However, now when my videos record, it’s just a black screen 2 out of 3 recordings. The videos that do actually record, some of them are basically just a frozen screen shot but no video. So I’m paying to keep these videos, that do me absolutely no good. I’ve been troubleshooting with an Ashlei O. But can’t figure it out. I’ve done everything she asked. I’ve sent her 6 emails since her email telling me what to try. She just won’t respond to me. It’s now been a week since I’ve heard from any one that can possibly help me. Not sure if they sent me a refurbished ring which is why it’s having issues. My internet connection is great. My router is in a good place. I have no idea. But a few of my clients that have come to my home this last week have asked about my ring doorbell. I’ll continue to tell them to stay far away until someone actually calls or emails me to figure out the broken replacement ring doorbell that they sent me. 

I’m not sure if I’m doing something wrong or if I have a defective ring doorbell. It will only occasionally alert me when someone comes to my front door. I had a group of kids, on my porch, leaving a derogatory comment spelled out in rocks, and it didn’t record them at all. I would’ve loved to see who that was.

To make the cameras functional I have had to purchase two cameras per each location.  For example I have a RingPro doorbell and a second camera facing 90 degrees off the other camera. One of the two cameras gets the intruder. I have the same set up for the driveway; two cameras at different locations. The cameras caught some fellow around 2 in the morning walking up into the driveway and trying the door handles of the locked cars. The RingPro extenders don’t have enough range. I have had to purchase a more powerful extender to get the speed and quality up on one of the cameras. The notification on the iPhone cannot be changed so the sound is like tinker bell. I have asked for a vibrate only notification but so far nothing. Bottom Line: don’t expect to purchase ONE camera and have everything work without problems. This product is still being developed. UPDATE: Ring keeps getting better...they have done away with the “tinkled bell” alert sound as the only alert sound and added voice alerts which are much better.

When I tried view even the most recent motion activation, I was able to receive the notification, but I had a message stating my plan was expired attached to every single notification (Motion, Live View and Doorbell). I spent an hour on the phone with customer service as my plan was not expired. The rep couldn’t explain what happened. On a whim, I deleted the app and reinstalled it, and tadah,  everything came back. Ring People: if you are reading this, please correct whatever went wrong!!! I didn’t even know that my videos were deleted or that newer stuff was not being recorded until I went into the videos to delete the ones I didn’t want.

While the cameras come in handy in us keeping an eye on our packages while we aren't home, they're really good for nothing. They're inconveniently dysfunctional. The motion detector really isn't that great. There has been two incidents right in front of our driveway and the cameras caught nothing. One of our guest's car got broken into. When we looked back at the videos, it recorded cars driving by and all, but nothing of what happened. The front door camera captured a small glimpse of someone already walking right off so we have no idea if it was that person or not. So helpful, right? The other time, someone threw a glass bottle at our guest's car. Once again, nothing. I noticed that if there's continuous movement, the camera records the first 30 seconds and that's it. Basically, all it'll catch is someone walking up to your house and what they do is history. This makes Ring not a reliable security system at all. My biggest problem with the cameras is, sometimes the live video won't even load! And NO, it's not because of our wifi.

It takes too long for me to move from the notification to the video, even on high speed WiFi with my iPhone XS Max.

I spend a minute refreshing the list, all the while the item setting off my motion detector has moved to a new location. 

I love the cameras and the system overall, but the time delay from notification to viewing my camera feed is too slow and cumbersome. This eventually causes me to pass on viewing some motions.

Night vision is very over exposed. Faces are not recognizable. Sometimes motion activation is very late. Not all the time but that takes things down a notch on the trust factor.

         Last is the doorbell “shows motion alert” at 3:47 every morning.

I live in a rural area and the only traffic I usually get are family members or deliveries.  I had a digital doorbell prior to ring and although ring was simple to install, I apparently didn’t install ring correctly (because the doorbell no longer works), but I also have “Chime” and prefer Chime over the digital doorbell any day!  I also love seeing pictures/comments from the neighbors with ring (there seem to be a lot of us) - ring makes a great neighborhood watch.

I have two very small complaints (which is why I scored it a 4 and not a 5):  I thought with power the battery would last a long time without requiring a charge.  It lasted almost 2 months.  The bright side is that I was sent an email warning me about the battery requiring a charge and the battery took seconds to remove/replace to charge it.  My second complaint is that activation is supposed to be triggered by infrared activity and not motion, yet when it’s windy, ring goes off a lot.  I could have gnats or something flying by, but I never see anything in the video.

Overall - I love ring and think it’s a great product and am exploring other products in the ring family.";"2018-10-10T20:00:17-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=926252661&type=Purple%20Software";"926252661";225;"en";"POSITIVE"

A get a motion alert and nothing is there because the camera is constantly freezing. I paid the yearly fee for video not pictures or nothing at all. Ring Pro is absolutely useless and like having no security feature at all if not doing what it was intended to do. I'm also glad to see I'm not the only one having this problem so support can't say it's on your end.

Update: Almost a year later and this doorbell is still a disaster. It worked great for about three months and then the developers started rolling out updates and the thing hasn’t worked like it should since. I have been through four of these doorbells within a year. The last one just stopped working completely. I’m a software engineer for over 20 years and sometimes being on the phone with CS for over an hour can be insulting. The video stream is choppy and not consistent. I continue to get pixelated video and freezing. UPS rings the doorbell and the video shows the driver leaving in his truck.

I like the neighborhood feature and the ease of integrating other Ring products. However, the app insists on being the most important thing going on. If you select banner notifications, they do not automatically disappear unless you do it manually. This becomes especially problematic when I am using my phone for directions and the banner blocks the next turn and how many miles until the next turn. If I’m driving and try to swipe up, oftentimes I accidentally tap the banner, which opens the app. Then I have to pick up my phone while driving and try to switch back to navigation before I miss my turn,and this happens all the time. I want banner notifications but not permanently. 

The other gripe I have is the audio notification. If you are talking on the phone and someone sets off the motion detector, it notifies you over your conversation and you miss everything that was just said. If someone God forbid rings the doorbell afterwards, you miss even more of the conversation. I’m in sales so it has hit me at a few crucial times. Me: “so what kind of budget are we working with?” Customer: “well we really like what we see so we desigMOTION DETECTED AT YOUR FRONT DOOR and I think we will be able to commit to DING DONG will that work?

Ring doesn’t tell you, even with the app, if users do not have an existing door bell they will have to buy a chime, and external power pack from Ring.  Oh boy, more money to spend and more time to wait on using something you purchase! Another thing they do not tell you, the thing quits working if someone rings your door bell. Apparently a common issue if you bothers to read feedback comments on here. 

To reset it, users must unplug the “Ring power pack “, wait a minute or so and then plug it back in.  Very much rendering it useless and time consuming.  In addition they do not tell you the lag time it takes the app to open and show video if someone does ring the bell or sets off the alert, plus they have this new feature that makes even that more complicated by opening in past time forcing the user to advance to live.  Now, I’ve change my internet provider and have no way of changing my WiFi setting in the App and when I pull the stinking cover and push the rest it never shows in my WiFi as an available connection so I can add it to my WiFi

The doorbell cam is too simple and not customizable enough which is weird because naturally that’s where more vehicle movement will be.. the flood light cam was worth every penny even though I can only use on about 25% sensitive due to said issues, it still picks up everything I need. The doorbell cam I’ve actually considered removing other then it offers one simple function, when someone rings I can talk to them. Other then that I’ve turned it’s sensitivity all the way down on the doorbell, I don’t need to know every time a box truck or the mail man goes by. 

All in all the floodlight cam is worth the money! The doorbell would probably be worth it if you lived in a quit neighborhood will low traffic.

Also, at night the alerts go off constantly on some evenings. When i view, there is absolutely nothing there. I have it on the least sensitivity (people only), yet still goes off all the time, especially when it rains.
Then I have the original video doorbell. I hate that thing. Battery is dead after a week with almost no use, but i could live with that if it worked properly. Works maybe 10% of the time. Most of the time I get a black screen on the videos. It is installed properly, Has good connection. Yet I’ll get an alert and when I view the video, yep just a total black screen throughout the entire video.
Now let me end with saying there is nothing wrong my connectivity. I have very good speed (pay for the highest my cable company offers), and the app shows good connectivity. I wanted to get others for my side/back, but very hesitant. I also like that they now have the home security, but again very hesitant.

In fact they would probably never turn on if I didn’t delete all the schedules. So now I just manually turn motion on and off until there’s a fix. Everyone seems to be having problems since the latest update.
UPDATE: I got help from their support team. What I did and I believe it worked was delete the app. Reboot the phone and then installed the app again. So video alerts are working fine and since I got my RSSI to about-42 it works really good. 
Another update: ok I’ve got the same problem again. The schedules seemed to work until a certain day. Like one other review said it seems that days are off. So if you schedule your device to not alert you on a certain day it will likely turn off the day before you had it scheduled. So until they fix this I will have to not use the scheduled alerts.

I think they need new, or more developers, and deal better with expansion of their client base.

The app on the other hand, which is what this review is about, has gotten progressively more complex, annoying and cumbersome.  Internal ads (for “new features”) distract from real camera views.  You told us once about modes and motion verification, we don’t need to see a reminder about the “great new features” every time we open the app.  The device settings screen now has more tiles than fit on the screen without scrolling.  Either organize this stuff better or let us remove things we don’t personally need - for me it would be “mode settings”, “linked devices”, and “shared users”, for others might be something else.
And the message to “Add a Ring solar panel to Extend Battery Life” (their caps not mine) continues to appear for cameras *which have a solar panel attached*.  Is there anything more useless than that?

The problem with Ring is 1.) they ALWAYS promise features and updates that never show up. For example, If you own an iOS device and keep falling for Ring’s baloney “we are working on HomeKit” story just keep in mind they’ve literally been saying that for almost three years and they haven’t even been testing HomeKit in public beta yet so it’s not showing up anytime soon. 2.) The most important function of the camera is the ability to quickly access the video when there is motion or someone rings the doorbell. For some reason, whenever either of those events happens, the live video freezes up and won’t let you access it. I believe this is because the camera starts automatically recording (which is good), but it’s incapable of recording and letting you access the live feed at the same time. It’s extremely inconsistent. What is the point of this if you don’t get to see and talk to the person until two mins after the event? So bad. And it’s NOT my internet connection. I have several other far better WiFi cameras in that area of the home that works flawlessly and I have a 1,000mbps internet speed (regularly 300+ over WiFi).

After being told by neighbors the doorbell wasn’t working, I called in to find out the doorbell had been offline for about a week and a half. Not very good security if it goes out and doesn’t tell you it’s out. I called in to fix the problem after getting stuck in an infinite loop of trying to reset the device. Turns out it’s a common problem “that the team is working on”. Thanks for the heads up, glad to know someone could have broken in and done what they wanted and I’d have been none the wiser. They have no idea when the problem will be fixed but it will “automatically fix itself” after an unknown amount of time. Not sure how the device will update itself when it can’t connect to the network but sure, ok. They basically brushed me off the phone and said sorry, not sorry.

Notifications stopped coming to my phone altogether. My chime pro failed. What’s the point of a video doorbell that doesn’t notify you when someone is ringing it? Ring needs to halt all new product development and put all effort toward fixing their buggy software. The core experience is broken. 

Old review: As others have said Ring needs to work on the core experience of using the app before adding features. When you click a notification or answer the doorbell it is a minimum of 10+ seconds before you get a picture. I always find that I can just walk to the door faster than I can load and connect to the Ring app. I have an iPhone XS Max and 150mbit fiber with Ubiquity WiFi so I know the lag isn’t due to my hardware or connection. This core experience is one of the most important parts of the product and Ring needs to improve it before I can really recommend their cameras. The slow response time really makes the doorbell and cameras pretty useless for any real time monitoring and communication. The recorded video and motion detection parts work well, but Ring markets these things for their real time functions and that part doesn’t work very well.";"2019-12-09T13:20:44-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=926252661&type=Purple%20Software";"926252661";228;"en";"POSITIVE"

For example, the app allows you to group Ring outdoor cameras with the Transformer in a single lighting group, which enables the Transformer to light up when motion is detected on the camera. This is a really handy feature that allows you to coordinate all of your lights on the camera’s motion detector. However, the camera’s lights automatically turn off after a short time and, when they do this, they also force the Transformer to turn off the landscape lights, thus overriding whatever turn-off schedule you have set for them in the app.

This is clearly a flaw.  The app should prioritize the lifting schedule first and the landscape lights should only turn off and on with the camera OUTSIDE of the hours it is already scheduled to be turned on. Ring should fix this bug or, alternatively, give the user more options for specifying when the Transformer should respond to the motion detected on the camera.

The fact that this bug exists makes the Transformer feel like an orphaned product.";"2021-07-06T16:38:54-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=926252661&type=Purple%20Software";"926252661";191;"en";"POSITIVE"

They are not patient. They redirect me to the instructions, which I have already tried. I am an older man and they have not taken time to walk me thru things to completion.

The service is not terribly expensive at $30/ year BUT if you don’t buy their service the camera is nearly useless.  There is apparently NO local memory on the camera to record even a microsecond of video events. Clearly there MUST be a video buffer that holds the data before it is transferred to Ring’s remote servers. Ring has intentionally prevented consumers from accessing locally recorded content. 😡
   Also, once my trial subscription ran out I suddenly started having connection problems with the device. I would receive notification of motion but then could not open the video camera - it says “temporarily unavailable”. Nothing has changed in the local network and there is NO reason I should suddenly start having this problem. Ring has clearly engineered the device to fail if you don’t give in to their extortion. 
  I know this may sound a little ridiculous over $30/ year but as an engineer I know the company has intentionally designed this device to extort money from consumers and it really makes me mad.

Let me explain you... When watching video playback from other people’s post, there is no scrubbing; you cannot fast forward or replay portions of the video. You can only ‘jump’ to sections of the clip. 
Why is this important?  
Because when you watch a video and want to identify a person, their clothing, their actions, their car, etc. you need to be able to replay that specific few seconds of the clip, but you cannot. You have to replay the whole clip or keep jumping to that ‘area’ of the clip. This is not a smooth user experience.
Additionally, maybe it’s my iPhone X or iOS version, but when i get a notification and get redirected to the message board or Live video, It doesn’t load properly unless I exit out and re-navigate to that message board or video shot.  It’s like it is not fully loading and i always have to go back to the ‘start’ to reload the the section.

Old review.....Warning: it takes 20 to 30 seconds from when someone pushes the doorbell until you hear it on your phone. By then, they’re gone. The video function is spotty and the device needs troubleshooting every 2-3 days. Many times it doesn’t start recording until after we’re in the door or the person has left. 

I’m sad to say that after spending hours dealing with this device, it just isn’t ready for prime time. Save your money.

Recently upgraded my phone, deleted and re-installed app again - still doesn’t work.  I noticed they have now released a secondary app called Rapid Ring that supposedly addresses their slow loading (never loading) video. It would be better if they just fixed whatever they messed up to crash the original app. I guess I’ll try the new one, but I have very little faith in that.  Oh, I have a google mesh network with excellent reception at all cameras, so it’s not network speed. It’s their app and/or hardware. 
For now, I guess I’m stuck with three hardwired floodlight cameras and a doorbell camera that, although hardwired, still requires me to take out the battery and charge it every few weeks (even when only set to record when the doorbell is pressed).";"2021-11-02T14:07:08-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=926252661&type=Purple%20Software";"926252661";209;"en";"POSITIVE"

My wife has the primary account, and I have the shared account. We need separate accounts because we have very different notification settings. However, as the primary, she has more options than I do. For example, she can get low battery notifications and I can’t. But I’ll change the batteries. How does this make sense? Our schedules are different and her work is demanding, so the fact that I can’t receive those notifications is an inconvenience at best. I also can’t add devices as a shared user. I have to log into the app as my wife to do so. If having a primary user is a security thing, why does ring keep suggesting I log in with her email and password? So while the app can be problematic, the root cause may be that the design of the system having a single primary is flawed, and it makes the app look bad. But like I said, despite these issues, at least we have security that works. That does improve the app score though. I’m tempted to add a star because what functions in the app does a good job...but I’ve been so aggregated with Ring after spending close to $1000 that I can’t bring myself to be that gracious.";"2019-07-23T08:35:46-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=926252661&type=Purple%20Software";"926252661";229;"en";"POSITIVE"

I have missed a few events due to this delay.  Would be nice to be able to select delay (obviously less delay would use way more battery power).
Second star deducted was for the lack of ability to adjust the motion zones.  Only being able to do a low arch across the bottom of the video is pretty lame.
The video quality is a perfect blend just enough you can zoom in a bit to see a face and low enough to keep the monthly/yearly cost low.
They are pretty reliable.  There have been a couple occasions I could not connect or took a longish time to connect.
The solar panel+Spotlight cam is a perfect combo!  I have two and being completely wireless, these are fantastic, a little pricey but well worth it...If in full facing sun, only need one rechargeable battery, if solar panel is facing north/west in back of house, it’s marginal (due to mostly in shade 1/2 day).

Prior to that step it does allow you to backoff the sensitivity to the WHOLE view, but that does not fit well for my needs. Please consider this as a possible feature in your app. BTY I think the black screens (or some that is) could be occurring bc of a delay in WiFi loading the video slowly. I had a black video, could not figure out why. Left it on the app for days, today went back and it finally loaded what was captured.

Within the app you can change the range the doorbell detects motion and also turn off certain ""zones"" if you feel you don't need to watch that particular area. You can also turn off notifications for both motion and doorbell rings and it will still record. 

As for the customer service at Ring, each rep I've spoken with has gone above and beyond to provide excellent customer service. I have two Ring doorbells and a Chime Pro and am currently looking into their other devices to add to my existing home security. 

If I could change one thing it would be to add the option make motion recording last longer when I haven't answered the alert on time.

I am able to quickly call up live video about one in six or seven attempts on a good day. On the doorbell, it never works. I can look at video clips well after the fact, but I have effectively zero ability to see or interact with people on my property in real time.
It is NOT my wifi or internet connection, which is the dodge Ring’s support people always fall back on.

However the delay with the notification and being able to see a person when I get notified definitely has a delay. The other delay that I find is when I click the live view it always seems to circle until I close it and then re-open it which kind of defeats the purpose of wanting a live you when you sense motion. The other thing that I have to find fault with is when I purchased a new router, you would think the app would allow you to change your Wi-Fi settings on all of your ring devices. However this is not the case at all! In order to change the Wi-Fi setting on the cameras you have to climb up and push the reset button on the top of the camera. I’m not sure about you but when I had it installed up near the top of my roof I never intended on having to climb back up there or have somebody climb back up there to reset it.

My husband checked the alert and jumped up from the couch to look outside the window that overlooks our driveway.

Sparks shot from an outside light as smoke rose, obscuring the light and Ring camera. 

The sparks quickly turned into bursts of flames. 

“Call 911!” My husband yelled. 

I ran for my phone and called 911. 

A fire truck rolled into our driveway a short time later as my husband tried to douse the flames with water from a hose.

Within an hour, the fire marshal told us that the fire had been extinguished, contained to an area that abutted the laundry room. An inspection of the house, which included the attic, confirmed that the fire had been isolated to one area of the house.

We were extremely lucky the house didn’t burn down.

If we hadn’t received the Ring alert on our phones that detected motion from the smoke, the outcome would have been the opposite of our good fortune. 

We were able to call 911 within seconds of the alert on our phones. 

Timing is everything in life. We knew within seconds that a fire had started in the wires connected to the outside light.

Had we not acted as quickly as we did, our house would have been engulfed in flames. I’m certain of that.

But, thanks to Ring the fire was quickly contained. It didn’t have time to spread and consume our house.

Love this product! It’s so nice to be able to see who is at your front door before you open it!! The subscription service is a nice option for people who need the ability to watch recordings of who has been at the door. Motion detection could be easier to set up. Not all homes will need the wedge to help keep motion alerts within the alert area. The wedge is really most helpful for areas with status. Where there are no stairs & your door faces the street, the motion feature will send you notifications whenever cars go by. After trying to fix this issue & having no luck, I finally decided to turn off my motion notifications for good. The unit comes with one battery, but I would recommend getting a second for easier use.

I let the unit update itself while it was connected to the old router. I changed the WiFi setting to connect to my main router and finally it connected. The other big issue I have is that when The camera is only showing black and white (night mode) all the time once installed on my front door. I am in an apartment that has a well lit hallway. When I tested this inside my apartment, the video showed color so I know the hardware is good. The fact that the software does not have a setting to turn night mode off is an annoyance. The black and white is in such a high contrast that there facial features are washed out. Pretty makes it useless. I am keeping the unit in hopes that this last issue gets addressed soon.

This, of course, leaves us with outcomes of false alarms (AGAIN ALL THE TIME). We end up ignoring these alarms, and again, like previously mentioned, another supporting fact that the main point of having these cameras becomes useless!

They only capture a video image after the person is already leaving the camera view. I have worked with the tech team on multiple occasions to source out the issue.

Haven’t had it too long and it really never works correctly. Either it too sensitive and picks up bugs, wind blowing trees, birds, or cars driving by or it does not pick up motion of anything. No in between. Believe me, I have slightly adjusted settings in every way. I have notifications on banners, everything but I’m not getting notifications until it’s too late. One time a person tried to open my door, by the time I got the microphone up, they were gone and short story it caused me to call the police. Yesterday, my daughter said someone parked in our driveway and walked up to the door. I looked and nothing was there. When I try to open an activity, it sits pending for 2 minutes before I can see.

By in large I’ve been very satisfied with the quality of the hardware, although the motion and light sensing on the floodlight cam is a little quirky. 

The app however could certainly use a speed boost. It’s a bit slow to launch, and if there’s an update available it makes being able to quickly open a live feed from a camera even slower, as you now have to dismiss the notification first. 

Ring- most users aren’t opening your app just to play around for fun; they’re opening it because they quickly need to view a camera feed. When a moments passed, its passed, and due to the apps responsiveness, that happens entirely too frequently. With very fast and strong WiFi, and hardwired cameras, there’s no reason it should take more than an instant to view one at any given time, except for sluggish interface.

I have twelve cameras inside and outside my home. Recent technology advancement have made integrating cameras so much easier than in the past but....

I have tried nearly all the camera systems.  I currently use Rings outside because I like the depth of products and network buildout allowing the neighborhood to share info.  However, inside I use Arlo because they allow me to turn on and off all cameras at once. I have wanted to phase out my Arlos inside the house and add Rings to have a truly integrated system but they are missing a few options that make switching over impossible for day to day ease of use. 

Ring, please add a feature to turn on and off all cameras with one command.  Also add geofencing like Arlo has. If you want it to be industry leading, add geofencing by device so the cameras know if someone is home and don’t turn on if just one person leaves. When both people leave (or all home occupants), they go on.  

I don’t want them on when I’m home but/and I need them all on when I leave the house. The outside ones can stay on 24/7 so implementing multiple zones could accomplish this.   Zone 1 inside, zone 2 outside.  Each zone can be turned all on / all off with a single command.

The button internally essentially got stuck burning out the indoor chime. Lots of troubleshooting replacing the chime, transformer (twice) to find out it was the button. Ring addressed my issues very promptly and offered to replace even after warranty expired which speaks volumes. It was a lot of frustration to get there, but they made it right. When the system works, it works well. Does have the occasional “freeze” issues and over notification of motion when cars pass even after setting it as far back as possible. I believe the new ring pro has better software to address that, although I cannot speak on it, as i had the original ring doorbell.

The development team have to be losing their mind. They keep pushing out updates on integration and neighborhood alert functionalities; how do you expect these to work when the primary function of the device (real time surveillance/interaction) doesn't work?
Ring alerts don't work when you try to see what's out there --infinite camera loading loop. Live view is hit or miss --fails just when you need it.

Awesome!

Some feedback: 

I would really like more nuanced control over sounds from individual devices. For instance, when I arm my system at night from my phone, both the base station and the keypad announce that the system is armed. In this scenario I don’t want the announcement, but I don’t want to turn the sound off completely from these devices because I want arming / disarming directly from the keypad to make some affirmation sounds. 

Also, would really like the geofencing feature to work across multiple people. Right now it will remind me to arm my system if I leave the house, despite the fact that my wife is still at home and that I’ve added her to the system.

It takes too many button presses or taps to snooze all the ring devices and it seems like an easy coding job to add a ‘snooze all’ function.

The concept of the Ring is great - but you’ve got to have really good wifi for it to work well.  Also, the app could use some design improvements - we have a Ring doorbell and a Chime and would like to be able to snooze them at the same time and for the same amount of time. For example, the Ring doorbell allows you to snooze motion for 15 minutes, 30 minutes, an hour or 2 hours, but the minimum snooze time for the Chime is 1 hour!  And to snooze both just to let out the dog, you need to tap your phone screen 8 times!

The chimes come in within seconds and the secondary chime hardware I setup in other rooms chimes immediately. Nothing to complain about. Very satisfied. 
Some additional nice things were the instructions. I am so use to the garbage instructions that look like they are Chinese rewrites that when I opened the box and found several manuals to do installations I was amazed. The manuals had plenty of pictures and appear to have been written by an American with consumer installation in mind. Very thoughtful. 
Also they included so much stuff from screws to screwdrivers with the unit I was impressed. 
This is how a startup earns raving fans.

2. When using the app to watch the previously recorded film 🎥, the volume rockets 🚀 to the MAX!! Even after I have lowered the volume all the way in an extensive effort to keep the 12 month old Olympic gymnast I have as a daughter from waking up and bouncing around.
3. Despite turning off the lights on my exterior floodlight cameras through every crevice of the app, they are still triggered by motion and turned on. So when I am hoping to enjoy a peaceful night on my patio, with family and/or friends by the fire pit, we are flooded by bug hoarding lights that must be tamed at the power source (we are forced to flip the light 💡 switch off; we sometimes forget to turn it back on).

Yeah, I can pay an additional monthly fee for my multihundred dollar purchase to view the recordings that it’s always sending to YOUR private servers (Whether I pay for my OWN access to them or not!).

Also the neighborhood alerts are arriving to our account 20-30 minutes after they've been posted, instead of immediately as occurred originally. I'm glad it's not an Amber alert where time is critical, but it's important to me. Their event history repeatedly shows, "" No events"", on every day when I know I've received many alerts.

Someone could be trying to enter my home, passing by a camera rather than idling in front of it, so this is a security barrier to me. I suggest giving the option to not immediately be taken to live view — as a setting option. Or just stop taking us to live view automatically and make the motion recording instantly available. I can choose from the UI where I want to go. Or split the screen so I can see live and the motion recording simultaneously.

By the time the video is activated, the person is walking away, so I don’t get to see the face of the person.  Also, the first 2-3 seconds of the video is SO washed out or bright that you cannot make out the figure.  Yes I’ve tried repositioning the doorbell, moving it and even putting a shade over the top, but to no avail. I gave up checking the doorbell, unless there was someone at the door who was very patient or persistent.

When you share the app with someone, for example a family member who also checks the motion detection or doorbell at the instant your phone alerts you, I’ve noticed that only one of you will have access.  The other, won’t be able to have immediate access to the video.  I gave up checking, knowing the other person would check before me. 

I’ve played around with the zones for the motion detection SO often that I’ve concluded there is no happy medium.  Although I’ve set the zone as far in as it can go, it still senses when large vehicles, like a van or truck is passing by on the street.  I gave up with adjusting the motion detection and just let it detect whatever - even the Invisible Man!!!

Conclusion:  I won’t be extending my existing Ring doorbell with any other Ring products, I’m sad to say.

If I use their speed test off of their website called Bandwidth my download  speeds are close to 100 and upload speeds close to 6; by the router and by the Ring Doorbell.
When I use speedtest I receive download speeds of 120 and upload speeds of over 6, again by the router and the doorbell.

The system also disconnects from my wi-fi more often than I would expect, resulting again in not being able to view motion detection. Also, be aware you need 2 Mbps upload speed PER DEVICE in order to work. I purchased both Pro Doorbell and Spotlight Cam and couldn’t view motion detection on either because my upload speed is not high enough.

And they only started happening like a month or two ago

First, I’ve set up the location of my porch so that I only get notified when there’s motion on my doorstep, and not just when people walk by on the paths. The feature simply doesn’t work. I’ve set it up multiple times, but it constantly notifies me when people walk or drive by, nowhere near my porch. 

Second, when somebody rings my doorbell, I click on the notification, which takes me to the screen to show my camera, except it mostly doesn’t ever load. I can let it load for ten minutes, and it still won’t show me who is at the door. It works sometimes, but less than half the time. Kind of defeats the purpose of having a smart doorbell. 

I also can’t seem to get any sort of support from Ring. Their customer service forms seem to be unusable. Like when it asks for your email address. I’ll type it in, but when I submit the form it clears the text field and tells me I need to input a valid email address. (To the developers, If you make the form submit before clearing the text field, this won’t be a problem anymore.)

Anyway, it’s just frustrating. Considering switching to Nest. Wondering if that’s any better.";"2020-09-25T11:36:11-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=926252661&type=Purple%20Software";"926252661";245;"en";"POSITIVE"

At this stage I see the cons overshadow the pros which is a shame considering how good the hardware is. 

Pros: 1) Does a good job in detecting motion. 

Cons: 1) There is a lag from the time the notification is sent to the time you are able to view the video. As soon as you click the motion detected notification, most of the times you won’t find anybody at your door. If the courier guy left the parcel, you wouldn’t know who caused the alert until you go back to the video that got recorded. 
2) If you want to view the video that was recorded due to a motion detected, you have to refresh the app and wait for atleast a min before the video is available for viewing. Within a min, the guy has already left the door, what’s the point if I can’t view the video immediately at the time the motion is detected.
3) The response time of the app needs to be improved. It takes a few secs from the time you click the live view to the time you can actually view the live video.
4) Does not allow 2 way communication using echo show. Currently can only view the live video using echo show without communicating. That means at night, I have to look for my phone, turn the app on to talk to someone on the door when I have echo show right next to me.

This is a brilliant hardware that cannot live to its full potential due to software integration issues.";"2018-08-16T08:50:03-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=926252661&type=Purple%20Software";"926252661";283;"en";"POSITIVE"

Lately, the app and it’s functionality have been faulty. The Ring bridge doesn’t work as it should. The group lights says they’re on when they aren’t. And if you turn the switch to off, it switches back to on and yet the lights are actually off physically. When you turn on the group lighting, it doesn’t work or turn on as a group as it is supposed to do.  It was working before I upgraded the app recently. The lights connected to the bridge also turn on and off intermittently. And when checking the history, it says that it’s been turned on and off when we haven’t done so.

Is this Amazon’s way so that I would link Alexa to Ring? It’s the only thing I haven’t tried.  It should work properly regardless of whether I connect to Alexa or not. 

I’m concerned about the privacy issues with Ring. And the fact that its employees have been found to tamper with private home accounts. Furthermore, some employees are said to be offshore employed in Eastern Europe and I don’t really feel comfortable with that idea of those employees having the ability to check on American homes. 

This is unacceptable since I’ve invested over $2200 on Ring equipment including cameras, indoors and outdoors, lights, Chime Pros, sensors, all of it. Again, the group lighting doesn’t function as it should.  My wifi signal is strong and yes, I’m familiar with tech (IT admin).

But, they record only 30 seconds, so it’s only a snapshot of what’s going on. And it won’t record movement shortly after the initial 30 seconds meaning you might capture someone coming up to your house briefly but then nothing of them cleaning out your house if they hang around. The one feature I like the best is the live view it lets me see what’s going on around the house when I’m away or I can see if my garage door is open or closed.

The panels worked well, for a while....

Pros: 
- easy to install on your own
- aesthetically pleasing 
- Monthly fee is reasonable (especially if you have multiple cameras)
- picture quality is very high
- sound quality is good

Cons:
- maintenance is on your own with some guidance over the phone
- solar panels do not work.  The battery/camera loses charge even faster than before we had hooked them up to solar.
- a black bar appears on the video for the first few seconds which blocks the view of what is moving AND you can’t remove that black bar
- the video capture is delayed too long.  The time of motion to video capture is too wide of a gap.  There have been too many occasions where we’ve missed who ran up to the door and dropped off a package
- starred videos are supposed to stay in your queue forever, but they don’t. They disappear after a month.  Best to download any videos of interest to store them on your own.

I hate that I get a notification that someone is at the door (motion or doorbell), click on the notification, then it takes upwards of 20 seconds to load (if at all). I usually get the backside as they’re walking out of frame. 

The settings need to be improved to distinguish between a car driving by and someone standing at my door. With multiple cameras facing a busy road, I was getting so many false alarms to the point I just turned them all off. (What’s the point?)

Also with bad settings, we just went through the first snow storm - every flake seemed to be a new notification. If that monitor setting can’t be changed, at least give me a wider range (like 12/24 hours) that the alert can be snoozes. 

When it does correctly sense motion, it doesn’t do a good job or recording prior to the event. My videos typically start as the person or car has turned around. 

The security side also needs some TLC. For example I received alerts that the water/temp monitor had detected cold temps - ok, how cold? I do like that each sensor can be adjusted as needed.

Able to answer wherever we are and I can log in to see what's going on in the area with my fellow Ring neighbors.

What I don't like:
My door is set back from the front of the house and all I get is backlight, unless there is actually someone standing right in front of the camera or when the sun starts to set.  And when someone rings the bell, it takes up to 30 seconds for my app to actually bing to tell me someone is there.  By then they have given up on someone answering and turn to walk away and all I get is their back.  Last thing is motion capture... If I receive a package...

Why the phone couldn’t connect to the Pro baffled me. I have very strong internet I stream two movies at the same time so my internet service is not the problem here.

The chime pro was intended as a WiFi booster/extension for the flood light, but it didn’t help the signal at all. So we returned it and got the chime. Right now it’s taking about 30 seconds for the doorbell to signal the chime when rung. We do get motion notifications, but it’s usually so delayed that it’s defeats the purpose. And it takes so long to get into the app when you get a notification that even if I wanted to answer a door bell ring, the person likely would have walked away already. 
Overall, I like the idea of the system, but it needs improvements. We live in an older home so hardwiring is not an option without hiring someone and even with expensive boosters / extenders, the connection many times is so poor that we can’t even live feed the cameras.

Only technical complaint is my ISP can’t supply more than 0.5 upload speed at one location, which makes the video unusable at two locations.
The system used to allow me to rapidly review past activity of all cameras on my iPad, displaying all cameras and times in sequence until this last update- now It displays my cameras as four different accounts, making reviews of activity much more inefficient and time consuming.  My iPhone display has remained OK, displaying all of “my devices” simultaneously.
This last update seems to have been done solely for financial reasons with no regard to customers needs or convenience.
I fear Ring has begun the typical corporate process of putting their profits above customer convenience - In the meantime, I will stop adding cameras until I see what happens over the next few months.

Well have I been surprised!
Apparently I wasn’t the only one displeased with the last update.
The problem has been corrected- the display on my iPad has reverted to the older efficient form - displaying all cameras and activity simultaneously.

I congratulate Ring for listening to their customers!

I gave four stars because I have noticed that in live view during night and sunny bright days, the view and also when zoomed in slightly can be seen very fuzzy and seemingly it’s quality changing constantly which is creating a choppy live view feed. That’s not good. Upon review of the recording of that live view you can see there is not that problem. The video is clear and smooth. Not sure what is going on. Is it changing frame rate constantly? Also, the colors look blown way out of proportion at night when you first watch reviewed videos and over the duration of the video, it slowly adjusts back to a more natural, easy to view picture.

Setting up is a snap, wire free is a plus, battery usage claimed (by customer service) to be 6 month to a year? But monitor daily use about 8 -10% so went bought an extra for swap without service been down.... 

Real use that important to all users!
All use are under good network condition/ WiFi well connected.

I can hardly recognize any object or have a clear face view just few feet out if I never seen the person before, a stranger ! using iPad zoom the picture even worst!

Someone stole my bike out of my back yard. One video it’s there, the next video it’s gone. Nothing got recorded in between. 

A police officer was outside my house buying drugs. I witnessed this with my own eyes. I didn’t have my phone on me but I just KNEW I would have the video on my Ring. Literally shows the cop car turn the corner to drive on my block, camera stops recording. Next recording started 20 minutes later.

A man pulled up next door to my house but definitely within view of my camera. The man jumped out his car, started throwing trash and breaking bottles in the street. Trashed the whole yard next door. I even got into a confrontation with with him. The Ring video shows my car driving toward my house but cut off just before I even pulled into my drive way. The next video shows me walking inside the house after the street was already trashed. Didn’t record anything in between. 

Thus far, it hasn’t done me any good. Actually, it really just aggregates me.

The app seems like it may have been built using a cross-platform kit rather than written natively for iOS. It feels distinctly like a Google Material Design app.

That in itself doesn’t bother me to much, but may be what is preventing the developers from making use of native APIs, like CallKit. CallKit would allow an incoming Ring to show up just like an incoming call on your iPhone. It might even allow answering the call on Apple Watch via Handoff.

Also agree with others that motion events should show the start of the recording by default, perhaps with a button to jump to live view. A preview still image would be helpful for each recording in the list view. Extra points for showing a face. Same for the push notification itself: include a still image. 

As to the hardware, it would be so nice to at least have the option of an Ethernet jack with PoE. That’s what the Pro model really should have.

And I hope you didn’t want to see the first few frames of that video because even if you pause and drag the marker back to the beginning it goes ahead and starts it again. There is no way to have the video paused at the first frame because the app insists on starting it for you like it or not. According to their tech support there is no way to change this behavior. I requested a feature upgrade for it. If they put it in then I will upgrade the star count because it will then deserve better than three stars. Until then though, 3 stars it is.";"2018-06-26T16:48:07-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=926252661&type=Purple%20Software";"926252661";159;"en";"POSITIVE"

After speaking to some of my app developer friends, this would be an easy fix from programming standpoint. Don’t really feel like spending another couple hundred bucks on the camera so I hope nothing really serious happens in front of my house where I’m going to need more than 30 seconds.

So many users post sales people, and so on, people who aren’t causing any harm and are putting them all over the internet. I think the option to ‘report’ and take down a video if it’s not a lost pet, crime, and the like needs to be there because a doorbell is there so that we can talk to who is at our door but people should not be allowed to post something unless it’s serious. I really feel this distracts from the purpose of this app and I’ll say the same thing on the neighbors app to make sure you see this review and implement this.

So the talking through the microphone to try and scare someone off, is useless. It doesn’t always detect someone walking or parking in front of my house, yet it does detect almost every single car that drives by on street. So I spent even more money on the “wedge”, since that’s what was recommended to help with the camera angle detection and not pick up cars driving by. Didn’t work.

To the people who say the doorbells activate too late, make sure the motion detection setup can see the person before they get to the door. You might need to reposition the doorbell if it’s 90 degrees to the door and looking towards the street. Mine catches them about 5 feet before they get to the door.

I added 3 cameras, a ring pro, and alarmed my whole house with ring sensors. We spent a good fortune and fully invested in ring. We felt it was worth the investment for $100 a year with all our doors, windows, garage, and even electrical box protected. Here is why I only gave it 3 stars.

1. When talking to people through the doorbell, the reception is very choppy, static, and hard to understand. Ring attempted the fix by replacing our doorbell pro. Reception improved with people hearing us talking to them but we still can’t understand the door bell ringers. Even after upgrading our internet, our wifi to a fast speed of 130mbps.
2. No integration with apple home kit. Unable to control the cameras through SmartThings. Would be nice to have 1 app to control alarm system, cameras, door locks , lights, etc. All through Siri
3. When calling tech support, the customer service personnel, they are very courteous and nice, but sometimes repetitive and sometimes it would be nice to just get routed to tier two tech support and get our issues handled. 

4. We had an issue the other night where one of our keypads lost connection and the hub lost internet access, it took me 24 minutes with tech support and two transfers to get this resolved.
Don’t get me wrong, we feel that Ring has great potential, we only hope it gets better sooner than later.";"2018-10-03T20:19:56-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=926252661&type=Purple%20Software";"926252661";253;"en";"POSITIVE"

I receive all notifications which is great. The Ring chime functions as it should. But my gripe is with the app. The app frustrates me to the point it’s practically render unusable. Device Health is very good, signal strength ranges from good to very good keep that in mind. The issue I have is the app is not responsive if I open the app after the doorbell is rang. If someone is at the door I no matter what I do I can’t see who’s at the door. Which makes the app just about pointless. Whether I’m connected to Home WiFi or I’m connecting over cellular. The app video feed just shows a connecting circle but never shows the camera feed. 

The second gripe is when motion is detected you go to the app and you have to wait about 20-30 seconds before you can see the recorded feed. It’s such a pain. 

The final gripe is the iPhone X has been out since October. Why hasn’t the app been formatted to look beautifully on the iPhone X.  There have been plenty of releases since then Ring has done and not one update shows the updated format.

We just checked the footage this morning for a timeline of events and LITERALLY, the footage stops recording after the first 30 seconds and goes to taking photos.

We are very unhappy with this; our battery is draining so fast now, and we no longer check on our motion notifications. So if something was happening, we’d never know. At this point I would not recommend to anyone.

Live view will not load at all after the last update, which is the last “straw” of my patience with this horribly overpriced product. I plan to purchase Nest from Costco tomorrow ($200 for the Nest, 1 year of recording for free, and the Google speaker).  

Ring (eventually) achieves what it sets out to do: provide access to a camera outside my home and notify me of a doorbell ring. 

However, I experience anywhere from 3-90 seconds delay when trying to “answer” a ring, rendering that feature impossible to use. 

For the network-at-fault naysayers; I’m running Ubiquiti AMPLIFI mesh through a bridged Comcast gateway, and have less than 1ms latency internally (below 30ms to Google DNS) with nominal jitter internally (and under 5ms average external). One of the WiFi extenders is just seven feet from the doorbell. My phone runs on the same network as well.

Additionally, the 30 second recording limit isn’t enough time because the camera doesn’t even pick up the first 2-5 seconds of the motion sometimes. People stand at the door longer than that. If someone is damaging my property, that’s hardly enough time to capture a full event. 5-10 minutes should be an option included with the monthly subscription. 

Two stars because I can check the door when I want (though delayed to start) and have some past recordings available.";"2019-02-20T21:26:49-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=926252661&type=Purple%20Software";"926252661";232;"en";"NEGATIVE"

We click on the alert immediately, with full cell service,  and the app opens to a black screen with the answer/Hangup buttons and an indication it is loading, but never loads. Therefore, we cannot use it to see who is ringing the bell and speak to them, which defeats our primary purpose.

Ring’s base station can easily be re-connected but the cameras are a different situation altogether. This is an unnecessary security issue because if you need the cameras, say to watch your kids outside, there’s nothing you can do to reset it. I’ve tried everything but nothing worked. The base station and the camera(s) don’t operate together as one would think. Only the sensors are an actual issue for the base i.e. if one goes offline — arming the alarm would be pointless. It’s weird that there’s no silent alarm either. I think it would be better in certain situations.

No icon for neighborhood is anywhere in my app. No swiping left or right on the devices page shows anything either.

I get at least 20 false alarms per day. I'm turning this feature off which negates the purpose of buying this device in the first place.

I've had the Ring Pro for about a year and the standard product for about 18 months before that. I like the features for the most part and they have the right idea on functionality.

I would offer the following feedback/improvement ideas:
1. The product requires a fairly high upload bandwidth (most people who complain about a spinning circle would be helped by more bandwidth). I didn't get mine to function until I was above 2.5mbs upload speed. The designers should compress this better.
2. There should be a timer setting in the product to allow the user to set a time delay for motion. My flag in the front yard waves and I get an alert up to 20 times/day if the wind is right. A timer to allow me to require 2 seconds before alerting would solve this....it's annoying.
3. The pricing for the cameras is too high. There should be a flat fee for a household for a year.

For one, the app desperately needs iPhone X support. The entire UI looks unappealing on the iPhone X. Second, there are always delays and frequently “can’t connect to Ring” errors, especially when a camera’s motion goes off. Clicking the motion notifications causes the app to endlessly connect to the camera and never loads. You either have to force close the app, or keep pressing “live view” and the red “end” button to see video feed. The app in general also runs slow. It clearly needs optimizations.

Sadly, if you leave the motion zone active and schedule a time for alerts to not be sent, it still logs ALL the activity. Think of a front door. I think it would be really nice to schedule when the motion zones are active, not just when alerts are sent. For example, turn off the motion zones during the weekend day time when there is a lot of in and out from your front door. That way, it doesn’t log a bunch of you and your family and friends coming and going.

Second, also a delay issue with the recording... I get a notice of motion, but the camera will show me a delivery person walking away. Why did it not start recording as they approached? If this were package/porch pirate instead, I would get a great photo of their back. :-/

Third is the camera sensitivity. I keep restricting the sensitivity of the camera, and at this point I have pulled the zone in quite close to my front door, well away from them road, and any passing vehicle larger than a pickup truck notifies me that I have motion.

So the app says my battery is dead every 2 days. Being solar that is excessive right?    So I swapped batteries and plugged the one that was in the light in to charge and 3 mins later the light turn green to indicate it is fully charged. So nope battery wasn’t dead. 

But while the light wasn’t working there were setting options in the app I didn’t have before. Options to stop motion detections during certain hours, to snooze them for 4 hours etc. but it would not let me save these options.   

I replaced the battery and now these options do not show- what the heck!  This is what I needed bc this is just a flood light - it doesn’t need to send me motion detection alerts 24/7!  I have cameras for that. Plus could be why the battery drains so fast bc it is using it constantly. 

I like the system and the idea of everything on one app etc but if it can’t work better than this for the price we are paying it isn’t worth it!

In terms of features it is a very dated application, and doesn’t seem to have been updated with new features in a long time. It seems that Ring is more interested in promoting Nextdoor than they are developing user interface. Why do we still not have any ability to jump straight to a specific time or even get updates when someone actually rings your doorbell?

When someone does actually ring your doorbell and you try and preview, the processing time takes so long that they have already left by the time you even get an image not sure if this is by design or just poor execution.

Do not expect any real time connection. The TV person scaring away two men with live feed? It doesn’t happen unless those scofflaws spent significant time in his camera before he “caught” them.

As many others have said, despite having a good WiFi connection, it takes so long for the app to open up after getting a motion detection alert it makes it pointless. 

Despite having increased the motion detection area, we still are not alerted within that range until someone is already practically directly in front of our door. 

Now having updated the app, I get a notice saying “Recording Subscription Inactive”. Sooo, I purchase this home surveillance camera/doorbell and pay for installation but I can’t even look at the video history without paying an additional *monthly* fee? Yeah, all I get is the live view. 

To top it off, mine is wired as I’ve said. Before the tech left it was working fine when he pushed the button to make a noise within our apartment. As soon as he left and we wanted to test it and the app, it no longer did that. Of course all “tech support” did was advise us to spend more money and buy yet another one of their devices, the chime, which essentially is just the part you plug in so it can make the sound inside our house; so we solely rely on the app.";"2021-04-08T08:50:47-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=926252661&type=Purple%20Software";"926252661";230;"en";"POSITIVE"

1. In order to hear the app audibly notify you when someone rings at your door, the volume on your phone needs to be raised, which can be a distraction when ads or other app notifications pop up at a very loud level. Would be nice if the app notify volume could be tied into the ringer volume instead of the speaker volume.

But the software which would have been a 5 in 2015 is not one in 2020.

My biggest complaint? In the age of AI, Big Data and facial recognition technology, it’s absolutely inexcusable that your software does not have a feature to exclude/hide/not record certain people. I DO NOT need 500 videos of ME leaving from and returning to my place. I shouldn’t have to snooze notifications just because I’m cleaning or hanging out on my porch.

Since I usually have my phone on, near me, you should at least say, we’ll record it but stick it in a folder called Probably unimportant and delete it after so many days.  Or we won’t record at all (allow us to choose). I can see arguments about recording should someone sneak up and assault me.

Allow me to train the app to exclude other “known and ok” people/household neighbors.

So I can focus on the bad ones. But as it is, this camera, app and system has been more useless than useful.
