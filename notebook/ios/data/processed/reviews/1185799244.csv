The LS50 speakers are great, yet are handicapped by an app that is as unusable as it is unstable. Think multiple restarts of the app and speakers due to connectivity drops despite that my Google Wifi point is less than a foot away from the master speaker. The app has not been updated in almost a year, despite the 1.8 star rating here, proof that KEF either doesn’t care or has given up. I don’t which is worse, honestly. On top of all this, the Tidal integration is a minimalist horrid interpretation of the original version.

Now the okay: Latest app ver. will let you adjust volume in app using side buttons on iPhone (so you don’t have to switch back to control app), however when you are not in app, volume up/down don’t work. You can create playlist in the app, and it will also populate playlists from your iTunes library. You don’t have to use tidal to steam if your iTunes library is good enough.

Finally the good: speakers are outstanding, with good looks, soundstage, base response, and crisp detail at high volume, even over WiFi. 

KEF apps are taking hard knocks (maybe deservedly do). I am posting a review for iPhone/iTunes users to allow that app experience with KEF is okay. Speakers are worth the minor annoyances of WiFi streaming.

It fails to reconnect / find the speakers, even though the IP address is fixed. Anyways, how hard is it to cache the IP address and try that first? 

 The app is required to stream music to the speakers over the local network. To utilize the higher bit rate sources, you have to use WiFi/ Ethernet interface. Bluetooth streaming seems to work well enough and it's compatible with iTunes (Note: only over Bluetooth). I'm guessing there is some sort of DRM restrictions that prevent that. 

In any case they have integrated with Tidal Music service which provides high data rate encoded music, but at this point, I'm hesitant to sign up for a $16/ month subscription until I can connect reliably. I'm sure I'm not the only one with some buyers remorse and mixed feelings over this experience.

I bought the speakers directly from kef.com. Customer service is non existent. Below is an email exchange between them and me:
- Me: Hi kef, my ls50w cannot play AAC file. Can you help?
- Me, after no answer for 3 months: Hi kef, my ls50w cannot play AAC file. Can you help?
- Kef: “please check your spam filter as we have answered this question 3 months ago”

Sound quality, dynamics, detail and image are really impressive for a speaker of this size and at this price point.

But...we’re not here to review the speaker are we. The KEF Stream app is absolutely the Achilles heal of this total package. As much as I love the idea of this being a plug and play system to stream Spotify or Tidal without any additional hardware..it’s just not a viable reality given the poor reliability/stability of the KEF Stream app. It constantly drops the speaker connection while other devices on my network continue to operate flawlessly. 

My sense is (as others have opined) that KEF, as one of the legends of British loudspeaker design and engineering, just don’t have the depth of resources and engineering talent to execute at the level needed to be a top tier player in the digital domain. I truly hope they can make the shift and elevate their capability in this regard as I’m confident they can deliver best in class digital audio technologies and loudspeakers if they can get this right. As it stands today, that is not the case. 
 
For that reason, 1 star for the app holding back a pair of 5 star speakers. My solution has been to until Roon and simply utilize the speakers as a Roon endpoint.";"2019-12-08T07:33:43-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1185799244&type=Purple%20Software";"1185799244";231;"en";"POSITIVE"

Unfortunately, KEF + Tidal = music not playing.  Hence what I presume was meant to be a great partnership between Tidal and KEF has resulted in a bunch of others and I jumping ship and switching to Spotify. This probably doesn’t impact KEF so much, but if I were an executive at Tidal, I’d make darn sure it was fixed quickly, or I’d drop the partnership. It can’t be good for business.
