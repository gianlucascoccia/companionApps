Oh, and I happen to be a software developer myself with a background in UI design, and a fundamental rule of designing a good GUI / HMI for widespread use is that you NEVER rely on color alone to provide information.

#1 frustration: Lennox support does not have any idea about what is going on. The app has gone through a couple of updates. When doing so it has quit working completely.  When eventually reaching Lennox support they had no idea as to what was happening. They are so clueless as to not even knowing they had such a product. I’ve never had any satisfaction from Lennox or their dealers. 
#1 solution: WAIT and you may wait a very long time. I’m talking months. It has always eventually worked out the issues. 
#2 frustration: Every update seems to have removed some features. In the beginning I recall I could adjust its temperature with the time of day. This feature no longer exists. I miss it. 
I’m building a new home so I have been researching other manufacturers Wi-Fi Thermostats. It appears that few owners are happy with their devices. 
Thinking back to business school I think I know what is going on. These little ad on features generate no revenue for the company. It’s a free-ish feature.  It’s probably contracted out to a cheap foreign developer. You get what you get but it’s still evolving. Patience has no fans.

Is there any thermostat out there that will allow the heat / cool selection and temperature ?  I don’t need to program a schedule - which is sad because my Honeywell thermostat at my other house can do all of this. And it’s connected to a Lennox furnace ... it’s not as new as this iComfort model. 

Initially I was very happy with this new system, though the app offered only limited functionality - it was fine for what I needed. Then 14 months after installation, the Wi-Fi component of the thermostat went south. I called Lennox customer support and they walked me through a complete reset. The thermostat screen went black as a result. Service rep said to wait a couple minutes - nothing. She said that doesn’t normally happen. My bad, I chose to do the reset on a 14 degree snowy weather day. I called the installer and they sent someone out within an hour, and replaced the thermostat (still cost me $89). I also bought a spare ... which was hundreds of dollars ... because I live in fear of this one crapping out. 

And I get the same ‘can’t connect’ internet interruptions that others have talked about in their reviews. It’s especially annoying when I’m halfway across the country for weeks or months at a time and I can’t control the thermostat.

Developer doesn’t respond any longer to posts apparently.  Guess we will have to post about poor service on other sites too.  Will never recommend a Lennox product after seeing how Lennox has failed to correct or communicate about a problem they created. 

(Prior posts attached below)
 
The developer responded to my prior post (see below) telling me to contact the help line. Customer service and tech departments already have the information and my contact information.

Other posts here show the same problem with app being unusable because of crashes. The app has pitiful ratings while similar apps for Ecobee and Nest  are highly rated. 

Apparently management is okay with the poor quality app because they haven’t fixed it despite the terrible ratings. (Ratings would be far worse if app could be given a zero rating.)

So developer what are those of us affected by this app’s crashes supposed to do now????? 

And just what is the introductory info for this revision referring to when the text says “this one calls for a celebration”??? Reading the reviews and living with an unusable app seems more like calling for a period of mourning. Could you please explain?

Does anyone at Lennox corporate management care?

Several questions, developer, hope you will answer and bring back the old version until you can fix this one.

Prior post: The app crashes immediately on touching the “off” icon on two devices. Spent about 1 1/2 hours on phone with customer service and tech support and couldn’t fix the problem. So it is unusable. 

Why not just get rid of latest app? or offer two apps—old one and new one?

No evidence that Lennox cares when 2 months have gone by and still no fix for poorly rated app.  Says a lot about how Lennox management values customer service and quality.";"2020-10-16T11:33:17-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=527608198&type=Purple%20Software";"527608198";317;"en";"NEGATIVE"

The iPhone version wastes 3/4 of it’s interface displaying the temp, leaving tiny wheels at the bottom for changing temp. Clearly no user interface thought here. The iPad replicates the iComfort display, but that’s not saying much. Clicking a button such as fan pops up a button of similar size, divided in tree, and you must be exact in pressing the right option. Lennox could learn a lot from Nest’s design i.e. clearly Lennox needs a touch user interface designer.

In addition, for supposedly being an advanced thermostat, there is no data collection at all. No energy page with how long the system has been running per day, no graphs of the variable speed fan, furnace, or AC. Basically nothing to track energy use.

Unless you have to use it with an advanced Lennox system such as the XC25 and SLP98V, find something else.";"2015-05-28T13:58:12-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=527608198&type=Purple%20Software";"527608198";162;"en";"POSITIVE"

The biggest problem I have had with this app is the voiceover accessibility with the temperature wheel. I cannot tell what temperature the wheel is sitting on, so I have to hope that when I double tap on the temperature I want the thermostat to be set on, that it actually sets the thermostat to the desired temperature.

Furthermore, while it's wonderful that the indoor humidity level is displayed on the screen of the app, it sure would be nice to have the ability to change the desired humidity level by using the app instead of my having to ask a sighted person to come over to my house and set The desired humidity level on the thermostat itself for me.

The other big feature area that is missing is to be able to create new and edit existing programs. 

In addition, your APP SUPPORT link in the Apple App Store on the 'Reviews' tab for the app, just above where the reviews display, on the right hand side, does NOT take you to a Lennox Support page for the app, nor to somewhere from which it is easy to find a support page for the app. I was not successful in finding Support when I attempted to do so.

Through power outages, cable provider and modem failures, the thermostat has always come back on its own without intervention. Thermostat is controlling both the furnace and the air conditioner.

The user interface is very inconsistent. Odd that in one place touching an “X” takes you back to the home screen and in another an “<“ does the same function. Although I’m a retired mechanical engineer, for several years in my career I did computer programming for in-plant applications. This app suggests that the right hand didn’t know what the left hand was doing.

According to the App Store, the current version is 1.2, but my installation on my iPad says 1.1.9 (iPhone also). However, the App Store thinks I have the current version as it says “OPEN” and not “GET”.

The iPhone version doesn’t look anything like the thermostat or the iPad app. A landscape mode would be MUCH better.

Finally, perhaps the MOST troubling thing is that the app has not been updated in 2 YEARS!! In dog years, that is a lifetime.

Rating for iPad version:  3 out of 5 stars:

The iPad version is superior to the iPhone version in that it has a more modern looking UI that is very similar to the actual touchscreen thermostat.  All the controls necessary to adjust the temperature, fans, and seasonal programs are available.  However, I can't adjust edit the season programs or adjust the humidifier.

Rating for the iPhone version:  1 out of 5 stars: 

The iPhone is downright crude compared to the iPad.   I cannot edit the seasonal programs.   My biggest gripe is the horribly outdated UI aesthetics very reminiscent of pre-iOS 7 elements with respect to fonts and buttons.   I would suggest a landscape mode that can more accurately replicate the appearance and functionality of the physical touchscreen.

Whoever is in charge of App Development or Product Management at Lennox either doesn’t give a crap or is constrained by the upper management that doesn’t want to spare the expense to update this app.  If the latter is the case, this reflects very poorly on your customer service.

Know in this age of smartphones, the quality (or in this case, lack thereof) of your apps does make/break brand equity.

3). If I am not home, I need more ""Control""!  The app lets me change between programs I set while at home, switch to away mode and let's me adjust the fan operation.

4) The competition, Radio Thermostat, provides less data - but does provide more control of the programs.

- you can't adjust the humidifier or dehumidifier settings. This should be easy. Minimum requirement for a three star app to mimic all normal settings from the wall.

Second, just like grandpa's thermostat, you have a fixed number of slots you can program. Because apparently in 2017 they didn't have enough memory available for every 30 minutes like your nest can be configured. 

Third, its bright. As in light up the room bright. A thermostat should blend in. This feels like someone glued an iPad to your wall.
