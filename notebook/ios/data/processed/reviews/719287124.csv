Range is not the best either. Sometimes you have to just repeatedly do the same actions until it finally works. The app frequently loses devices or ‘cannot connect to server’ on multiple phones and different networks, so that clearly indicates centralized issues with wink. Their instructions are confused and unclear. E.g. they will send you instructions on how to connect a specific product, but the photo will be of a different one, so you have no clue what you are actually looking at. They also took nearly 2 months to even respond to a problem I had where my hub fell and broke, and i could not unpair the locks. They eventually solved the issue, after two months. That’s just dismal. At that time, they also started charging for the service... ridiculous.

However, when I contacted Wink regarding this issue (which I did before leaving feedback) I was offered an extremely small discount on their most expensive starter pack. Had I been offered any discount on a hub to correct this issue, I would have just ordered the hub and moved on. I did reply (twice) to Wink support to inquire about a discount on just the hub, and I have received absolutely no reply.

I bought into this equipment early; had a hub, multiple wink bulbs, their digital egg carton, and kept building my home around Wink’s hub and app. Throughout the process there were bumps. Lights didn’t always respond or stay connected, if you lost power in the middle of the night, everything would turn on and be disconnected (so you’d have to get out of bed and disconnect power to everything). Through it all, I stuck it out because I had bought-in and was willing to wait for improvements.

After a few years, it was pretty stable, but the stability then shifted to stagnation. Things would work (most of the time), but there were no improvements, no new hardware, minimal feature advancements, etc. And that is fine, I was getting my money’s worth from the app and hardware, until May 7, 2020.

Wink decided to go to a paid subscription model that essentially kills your smart devices if you don’t pay them $5/month. Also, wink only gave everyone 7 days to comply or be locked out. This brings me to my final thoughts of this review.

Why would anyone pay $5/month for a service that fails often, has poor customer support, and hasn’t made improvements on its app, services, or hardware in YEARS?! You should not. AVOID WINK!

Last week it stopped working with google home.  (Happened a few months ago as well). Well this time it’s been a week. I tried calling. Customer service office is closed even though it’s during normal hours.  They don’t respond to tickets submitted through the support form.   And the email listed to contact them bounces back as undeliverable.  

I got a basic generic response on twitter and Facebook saying we are working on a solution.  But they haven’t responded in four days.  And there is zero updates or even an acknowledgement of an issue.  And the status page they direct you to for updates is no longer a functioning page.  

The company is dying a slow painful death.  Do not waste your time or money on any wink products.  They will be defunct before you know it.  Look into other programs before you get a wink.";"2019-11-20T17:24:32-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=719287124&type=Purple%20Software";"719287124";161;"en";"NEGATIVE"

Good thing I did a bit of research first. It was clear last year that Wink was on it's last legs. Several years ago it was a solid, basic smart home system; but the platform has completely stagnated for the past couple years. I decided to hold off and wait a bit before investing any more money in their system. The move to subscription service MIGHT have been acceptable if: a) they hadn't blackmailed their users with only a 7-day warning to pay up or lose complete control of their smart home devices, and b) they actually laid out their plan for improving the service other than to say ""trust us, we've got big things planned"" (paraphrased from their emails to users). Feels more like a last-ditch effort to get as much money from users before shuttering the business. Time to move to SmartThings.";"2020-05-29T10:08:48-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=719287124&type=Purple%20Software";"719287124";165;"en";"POSITIVE"

I will NEVER buy another product from this company again, they are a bunch of con artist! I wish I could give them less than one star.

My initial review stands. Wink and Wink alone pulled the plug so the hub stopped connecting with their server, rendering the hub and bulbs basically dead.  Now they want me to purchase a wink hub at the cost of $129 or something like that, to make the bulbs work again...is that the real motivation for pulling the plug?

2.

The BAD is that when you are done the sort does not reflect the change, so I go back in to sort again but they are still sorted as I left them in the sort window, but the new sort does not get updated when you finish.

3.  It seems that if you modify your Robots, the changes don’t get updated.  I’ve had to reset the Hub for the changes to update.

The Wink software guys need better quality control or someone to actually use the app before releasing to the public.  I understand that some bugs are found by the public but some of the bugs should of been found by the software writers.

I’m sure it’s just as frustrating for their team, as it is for us, when a manufacturer drops off or stops doing what they need to do to function on the platform. Most of the negative reviews on this app are from people on the receiving end of such changes, outside of their control.

1. Because the font is grey and tiny, it can be super hard to see especially in lower light scenarios.  Please enable the ability to increase the font and make it easier to see with higher contrast.
2. Allow for sorting of devices.  I know I can use groups but being able to sort the devices alphabetically or manually would be super helpful.
3. Continue to add icons for lights or allow us to upload a pic.  As an example, my garage has tube fluorescent lights and there isn’t a good icon. Neither for exterior house lights, fireplace etc.
4. Enable me to turn on a light and leave it on for x number of minutes/hours.
5. The app has become super slow.  Turning a light off or on is taking >30 seconds in some cases.  Turning services off is failing.  (I use ios).

As a long time customer, with a rather vast network, let me share that Wink does some great stuff for those just getting their feet wet with home automation.

Where it all fall apart is in how Wink actually works as a comprehensive solution for more robust networks. It will not be long before you have more items then their interface can handle well. The UI hasn't seen a significant (if any) update in many years.

492;2522040774;"cbeecham";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id171099823";"6.9";5;"Works flawlessly for me";"The Wink Hub 2 is a strong, steady device and the app functions with it perfectly for me, and I have some pretty darned complicated scenarios that I run with it daily. I have supported devices and unsupported devices connected to the hub and the app controls them accordingly. I have a Maker account and write my own recipes for certain actions in IFTTT and have no problems with them running or communicating between the hub, app, or any of the devices I have attached. Rough estimate of devices I currently have installed is ~50; consisting of in-wall light, dimmer, and ceiling fan switches, On/Off and dimming AC outlet switches, in-wall micro switches, thermostat, window/door sensors, motion sensors, sirens, connected bulbs, you get the picture. They are all automated and have a job to do, and I can do the vast majority of what I want from within the app. The punchline is that it just works and I never have to touch it. I do, but that’s because I can’t help myself...it’s just my nature, but if I leave it alone the robots and shortcuts that I have set up run just fine. Everything plays well with Alexa, IFTTT, whatever. I can’t explain the app, hub, the entire Wink ecosystem working so well with for me and being a complete nightmare for others, but I guess it is what it is. I read one fairly negative comment that stated the app/device was only as good as its firmware, and I absolutely agree with that. I also believe that it can be limited by its owner. So, if having trouble, I’d start looking at device compatibility/support, make sure your network connection is stable, make sure the hub firmware is updated, make sure you have the latest update for the app, make sure your phone”s firmware is updated and supported by the app, check device batteries, and on and on and on. If that doesn’t sound like fun maybe the whole home automation thing really isn’t your bag because the app works fine ;)";"2018-05-08T19:01:39-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=719287124&type=Purple%20Software";"719287124";343;"en";"POSITIVE"
