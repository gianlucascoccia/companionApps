I really like being able to get a real time view of my pet and my door.  It’s nice that I can change the sensitivity on the app, view them on my IPhone while I’m away, and save recordings.  

There are a couple of things I’d like fixed.  The more annoying issue is that the app has no support for daylight savings.  My recording times listed are 1 hour off from April to October. I made sure I have my correct time zone set for both cams.  The other issue may be the camera itself, even though both my cams have the latest firmware according to the app.  On my older camera, the app records every 3 minutes, even with no motion.  There are too many phantom recordings.  It is only supposed to record with motion.  I’ve already lowered the sensitivity so that sunlight in room doesn’t cause recording.  Also on this camera, it’s only supposed to be black & white, even though sometimes it records in color.  That is very strange.  Also, this camera seems to selectively record motion.  When I walk in front of the camera while it’s powered on, it should record me every time, but it doesn’t.  It may be the different firmware in the older Focus 66.  I never got clarification.";"2019-06-01T10:15:31-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=796352577&type=Purple%20Software";"796352577";228;"en";"POSITIVE"

This camera is amazing and a huge in providing my loved one the best possible care. The camera enables me to continue house work while keeping a close eye on mom who cannot move and is in a hospital bed. The sound quality is amazing so if she wakes up and we are in another room we can hear her calling for someone. We just keep in plugged in and running at all times to amplify her voice as her speech is very limited and soft. Mom requires 24/7 care so at night who ever stays up with her can sit in the tv room to not disturb her and still see and hear her. Mom has a live-in boyfriend who cannot care for her as well as us so on his nights we can return home and b/c of the motion detection we can watch him with the phone application. This device has excellent video and sound quality and the motion and sound detection is so useful. We can even keep the camera’s sound running in the background of our phone while the phone is in use or if we are sleeping with the phone screen locked.

Why they don't fix it, I can't tell you. Maybe they just don't care? Poor business sense if you ask me. My app has so many issues, I can't even write them all down. The camera is ok but I have also had a lot of issues with it. When trying to move the camera view it goes so far to the one side. Sometimes when I try to do something for one daughter, even though I'm on her screen, it does it on the other camera. It's extremely frustrating. I hate that I can't do split screen, that's just Absurd, each of us have to have a baby on the phone. If you don't have your phone plugged in, count on the app draining the battery (even if your screen is off) very quickly. There are several issues with the camera but even more with the app. I hope they take some of the comments to heart (all of them mostly bad) and fix them like a good company would.

It sends notifications to your phone when it senses audio or movement changes in the room, according to the sensitivity you set.  There is even a two way radio so you can speak & listen through the monitor. We also really like that you can play music from the monitor and it even reads the temperature in the room! Some things that could be improved are the movement feature & microphone system, as they are a bit delayed and show flashing symbols on the screen that make it seem like the app/camera is lagging.  The music player feature is great too, but would be better if you could upload your own songs/music instead of the 5 lullabies provided.

I can’t have an app buffering for that long if I am using it to monitor my 8 month old child. At that point I could have checked on them and known faster. The app also times out after 5 minutes, saying you’ve been running the feed for that long do you want to continue? Of course I do! I keep the feed up at night while she’s sleeping since she’s in her nursery, yet another strike against the app developers for thinking we only want to check the feed every 5 minutes. I’ve had this app not work on both WiFi and LTE connection, so it’s not just my WiFi that it is unreliable on. Every time there is an app update these things are never fixed. They may upgrade the interface to make it look fancier but overall don’t do anything to fix the real issues.

The app also takes an excruciatingly long time to load. Especially when I’m trying to see why my baby’s crying without bothering her, it takes a few minutes to properly load If at all and by that time she’s either in serious distress or has quieted down again and I’m not sure if it’s because she’s okay or if it’s because she’s trapped.

A few weeks ago I was travelling and the camera showed “online” and I could see what I thought was going on live, but it said no new events in 24 hours, for two days straight. Therefore, it indicated that my cat had not eaten or visited her litter box in 48 hours. She loves food... After preparing myself for the worst and ultimately ruining my trip, I got home to find everything was great - the camera was just not capturing anything it should have, or showing what was truly “live”. What a piece of junk. I should have tossed it in the garbage then. 

The camera just shows a black screen in the app half the time (including now as I write this) - even though it says “online”. There is no way to reset it or any help articles for any of these topics.

Original review—-It’s been over a week since we’ve had connection errors for both of our cameras via the app and no reply from their support team. So we can only connect to one camera using the monitor (with horrible battery life) and cannot use the app. The fact that we can’t connect to the second camera with the monitor is a whole other looong story that their support team hasn’t been able to resolve so we’ve just let it go.

So to try and troubleshoot the current issue ourselves—-We’ve rebooted both cameras, refreshed the camera list, and removed/re-added the cameras with no luck!! We even have a prepaid yearly plan for camera monitoring but I’m seriously considering just buying a whole new system because of all the issues over the years.

When you swipe to app settings the app doesn’t register you clicking on any links or buttons, essentially the app is frozen.

2) General: Why can’t you have one parental account with separate logins like literally every other baby related app.  Doesn’t make sense (this is not iPad specific)
3) iPad: The app is not supported in landscape view, so if you have an iPad connected to a keyboard, you are forced to flip the iPad to use the app. 
4) iPad: There is no picture-in-picture option.  Imagine this, a baby monitor app that allows you to keep the stream open while you’re doing work.  This app doesn’t take advantage of iOS advanced features but it should.

There have now been two updates in a row that managed to update/fix things without breaking something else and that in and of itself is improvement. 

The audio is in and out consistently. There is also a major lag issue. 

I’ve mentioned this in previous reviews; the app never connects and streams directly from the camera. The camera is always streaming to servers on the internet and the app always having to go out to the internet to download that stream. Doesn’t matter if you are on the same WiFi connection as the camera or not. 

This means if you have the bandwidth and a quality connection to the internet your stream is only a few seconds behind. If you have a slower connection to the internet or the connection is sketchy this lag can be minutes. I have on more than one occasion left the tablet downstairs, walked upstairs, picked up my child from the crib, changed him, brought him downstairs, and then we watch the monitor as my child continues to play for a bit before my arms come onscreen and I lift him out.

First, connecting to the stream can take a pretty long time, so long it’ll regularly time out. If you get connected, the stream doesn’t stay connected for long. There are a lot of breaks in the stream.

Second, the event stream rarely works for me. I’ll get some recent images sometimes but for the most part I see “no recent events” even though there have been plenty every day.

Lastly, and this is more recent, the app itself will completely time out. It’s like I’ve pressed the home button, to get back to my home screen when I haven’t.

To me, these flaws are pretty significant because they are the reason to have the app! You want to be able to check in and see what has recently happened as well as what’s currently going on. That is a challenge and incredibly frustrating.

The only reasons I gave it 4 out of 5 is because the only way the camera is meant to be set up is on a flat surface. 
   We used command strips to attach ours to the wall , which was difficult because the bottoms is not flat! I wish this came with other options for placement. A clip for the side of a crib or bassinet or a flat bottom with wall attachment options maybe.";"2020-04-23T18:34:57-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=796352577&type=Purple%20Software";"796352577";154;"en";"POSITIVE"
