As it is, the only thing I can do when creating data for export is use the Apple email program directly. 

Many of us do not use built-in apple mail and we may want to simply export a PDF and take that into the doctor. Also, I want to be able to examine the export the data, especially if it's a PDF, before I do anything with it.  The point being that, we need to have flexibility when exporting.

So now when I decided to start monitoring my weight for my new fitness routine, you were the first company I thought of to purchase a scale from. But then I download your app, and it says I have to create an account with my email address (red flag #1). Then it says I have to download the new “pro” app, which according to the apple app store collects and stores my data on the cloud (red flag #2). So I go to your website (without downloading the new app) and find where I can create an account online, which prompts me to enter my name, date of birth, location, weight, height… 

I “nope” out of that and go back to the original app (which according to the apple App Store you claim does NOT collect my information on the cloud and it now allows me to login to the app, and promptly requests that I enter my height and weight. Which then shows up in my online cloud account… sorry guys, but nope. You don’t need to know this information about me, and I don’t know you. Even if I did trust you not to sell my data to advertisers ( and who has time to read your privacy policy anyway) I certainly don’t trust that you won’t get hacked and my data will be out there anyway.";"2021-10-01T07:32:36-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=566815525&type=Purple%20Software";"566815525";252;"en";"POSITIVE"

They spend millions of dollars on ihealth bp/health hardware yet they dont care that the app is useless which makes all the hardware useless as well. I wish a more competent company would creat a bluetooth bp cuff with an app that actually worked. The only reason these people havent went bankrupt yet is because they have no competition.

The reasons I am withholding the last star is improvements I need for the app. One, it will only allow two blood pressure readings a day. Not acceptable.
Two, while the integration of the “diary” to the calories and activity is smooth, it is not user friendly.
First of all, is finding this feature, which by its nature will be the most accessed, is difficult. It is buried deep in the app under settings.
Next, food entries are exclusively in ounces, while every nutrition guide I have found so far is in grams.
While they include a food list rivals Nutritionix, it will have everything but what you eat. Entry of new items often means deconstructing an item to its basic parts, translating grams to ounces and adding sub parts to the database as well. But there is no was to go back and edit you entry.

I downloaded the app and setup my account.  I attempted to sync after the first day and found that my data did not transfer and it cleared my monitor.  I gave it another day of using it and it synced fine at the end of the day with no errors.   I thought it was great!

This App: appears to have removed most all of the graphs, removed almost all of the color (now almost completely blue and white making it hard to easilty identify ""good, at risk, and bad"" results), Decreased the size of the fonts so that the text is more difficult to read (especially on an IPhone), and the navigation is not quite as intuitive as the previous app.

This app has tranisitioned into what I feel is nothing more than a glorified number tracker. I could use a spreadsheet and do the same thing with better results. The previous App was informative. The graphs and charts were useful in understanding and monitoring my BP

The only positives that I have found with regard to this app is that it combines the Blood Pressure and Weight monitoring into a single location and allows access to the information through multiple devices (web, iphone, ipad, etc.) Additionally, it can be used without purchasing the IHealth scale or BP devices. Finally, there appears to be a section that allows for goal setting and calorie monitoring. I have not used these parts yet.

In general I have been disappointed with the state of the current app. If IHealth would address some of these issues I would gladly reconsider this review and rating.

I was immediately disappointed because I could not import my existing blood pressure data into the new app. Later, when I began using the scale, I was also disappointed to learn that I would have to manually connect (with Bluetooth) the scale to my phone every time I wanted to weigh myself. The app is buggy, it frequently crashes, and it is not intuitive. The calorie log portion of the app is nearly useless because it has no scanning feature and no easy way to enter foods that you eat often or foods that are packaged. It seems to me that this app was released before it was ready to go. It's a shame that the makers of the app didn't do a better job and get it right before releasing it to the public.

The all was just updated to support the iPhone 5 and it is much more pleasing on the eyes. I can tell some work has been going into this App! This is very nice to see :)   Unfortunately the app still has a funky design layout, but the improvement is pretty big! So I'm increasing my rating to 4/5 stars. 

Old-----------------------------------------
Product works great, but the app looks atrocious. Okay not atrocious...but for a $70 BP monitor you'd think they could at least make an app that is iPhone 5 optimized. Unfortunately this is a review of the app, not the product. Regardless, the app is not exactly clean, and it has a lot of pointless buttons. The app needs a new cleaner interface, and it needs to be iPhone 5 optimized big time. The withings app is much nicer, and frankly if somebody is buying a BP monitor with the key feature being ""iPhone app sync"", they will be embarrassed once they see this app. Yes, the functionality is there but it's dreadful to use. Especially with every other app on my iPhone 5 looking much better than this one.

If this app is updated I'll update my review.";"2013-05-24T08:05:49-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=566815525&type=Purple%20Software";"566815525";201;"en";"POSITIVE"

Also, a comment about the iHealth BP3 device's charge-indicator LED: 1) it looks too much like an ON/OFF switch and confuses some users. 2) it goes suddenly from green (charged) to not having enough juice to take a reading, instead of turning yellow to show low battery.";"2014-04-20T10:10:40-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=566815525&type=Purple%20Software";"566815525";130;"en";"NEGATIVE"

I emailed customer support who responded quickly but were not very helpful. I had to explain the problem multiple times, with each time them telling me I could use both devices at the same time.

So we've been using the app on one device however it started recording my wife and my weights under the same account (it was tracking them separately previously) so I tried to change devices this evening and now it won't connect to any device. Very annoying.

People will rely more and more on medical apps to help self monitor their own health.

 Hands down this one is the best of the 3 units we evaluated and the amount of data it has collected (using the iHealth wifi scale and blood pressure monitor) is impressive. The scale is definitely worth an extra $99 because it measures not only weight, but BMI, BF% (Body Fat percentage), Lean Mass lbs, Muscle Mass lbs, Bone Mass, Body Water % and most importantly can calculate VFR (Visceral Fat Rating) which is calculated and as important as your BMI and is valuable from a medical standpoint when you are monitoring weight changes, lipid profiles, and trying to decrease your risk for coronary heart disease. Visceral fat, (gut fat), is the worst kind of fat and if your BMI is high due to high visceral fat, (VFR > 12), you are in a higher risk category for coronary artery disease (CAD) than someone with same BMI and and a VFR of 7. So monitoring you VFR as well as BMI and Body fat % is as (or more) important and lowering your VFR rating directly correlates with lower associated risk of CAD. 
 Overall, the device is a valuable tool which empowers patients and gives them the ability to monitor their own health and wellness and make necessary changes on a daily basis and will also allow for better communication with their physicians and provide them with objective data and instead of treating you when you get sick, focussing on wellness will have much better outcomes.
 My biggest problem and why I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 was the difficulty I had setting it up and lack of in-app support or on website but once I figured it out, the next one was a breeze.
(First review)
I consider myself to be somewhat tech savvy and after spending an hour trying to set it up and synced, I was unable to get it to recognize the device. I went to the website for instruction on a manual setup and found no help there. The reason I bought this device was to evaluate it and its accuracy for use with my patients in my sleep medicine practice. It seems like a very good alternative and cost effective way to monitor and evaluate patients sleep perception vs. sending them home with an actigraphy watch, which typically cost several thousand dollars for a single watch and health insurance rarely pays for it, (plus they would own it forever). But considering I can't set the device up myself and no way to communicate with customer service or support within the app, I can't recommend this particular product to my patients, many who can barely figure out how to send a text message on their smartphone. I can not understand why the device won't connect via Bluetooth to my IPad or even show up as a discoverable device.";"2014-03-27T08:34:25-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=566815525&type=Purple%20Software";"566815525";526;"en";"POSITIVE"

464;742069864;"Nutella Bear";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id101155264";"V1.1.2";4;"Great Product, Strange Reviews...";"I have the wrist BP monitor which I got because my BP needs to be regularly checked due to a medication I take potentially causing a hypertensive crisis. The cuff works great and is far less a chore than the machine that they use at my Doctor's office. The next time I go in I am going to have the staff check to make sure the cuff is accurate. The first few readings I did seemed in the right range. 

The software. It works and it looks fine to me. I read some comments that it is clunky and uses odd input methods. I am really wondering what kind of people are buying this (grey hairs????) but the software is pretty standard iOS stuff. Uses some spinners to enter parameters for example, but that is run-of-the-mill iOS style apps. Thankfully iHealth did not use any ""shake"" selections (at least that I've seen) because some of these users would smack themselves in the face...

Integration between the software and cuff is pretty fool proof. It can tell if you have the cuff on the left or right hand (needs to be left hand). And it tells you at what angle your arm is resting (needs to be relatively horizontal). No crashes or operational problems so far. 

I work with computers and it seems to me like some of the user's submitting reviews so far don't really understand how the technology works together. Or how their iOS devices work -- for example, pairing BlueTooth devices and whatnot.

I am pleased with everything so far! Good purchase for me because I can carry the cuff around with me everywhere. Four stars, because there are perhaps more features that can be added and it looks like they are working on expanding the environment with updates.";"2013-02-01T17:45:45-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=566815525&type=Purple%20Software";"566815525";301;"en";"POSITIVE"

We have forwarded this issue to our Engineering team and they are looking on how to resolve the issue.  Preliminary findings indicate that the update to the latest iOS version 14.6 is the problem.  This is the issue so we are looking at and how to adapt our app to that latest version.”

iOS 14.6 came out May 26, 2021. As of July 27th, Two months later, I still can’t connect to my HS5 scale with any device iPhone or iPad that has the latest Apple iOS including the current iOS 14.71. I’m lucky enough to have an old iPad with iOS 12 on it. I can download my HS5 scale data with it which then syncs back to my iPhone X through the iHealth cloud. 

iHeath has consistently lagged on software development and updates. Their other new app still doesn’t support most of their previous devices. This older app is rarely updated and is terribly dated. This especially frustrating since their physical devices tend to be excellent. I have had a whole range of their devices, BP, O2, Scales and even their activity tracker in the past. I still keep hoping for a BT thermometer. I have to say, generally, I love their devices and hate their software. With a better app iHealth could be soaring but instead is hobbled by a poor and getting worse app. Hopefully this will change, but don’t hold your breath.";"2021-07-27T09:26:57-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=566815525&type=Purple%20Software";"566815525";255;"en";"NEGATIVE"

It cost me around $300-400, but after a $250k surgery it was an important expense.

Took a while to dial in all the products - They aren't all perfect but when they work it is an ""elegant"" system.

The iHealth app worked well for about 6-8 months on my iPhone 8 always with latest IOS.

BUT THEN, the app mostly quit working. That is, it would try to open but would not.

 I would have to delete the app, redownload and reinstall. It would work about a week before I had to do it all over again.

It is getting worse. I need to Uninstall and reinstall every 12-48 hours now. I've been doing that since February 2020.

If this had started immediately I probably would have purchased a different system.

 Now my investment makes me hang in there HOPING  iHealth will fix this problem.

Until then I'd stay away if you hope to use their products with the iHealth app.";"2020-09-09T19:20:58-07:00";"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=566815525&type=Purple%20Software";"566815525";184;"en";"POSITIVE"

I do, however, have some concerns about what they consider a ""good"" blood pressure and what isn't. I have hypertension - my goal pressure is generally anything below 130/85. If I have a diastolic bp in the 80's, the app reads that as a concerning range, yet raises no alarm when my BP reads 67/45. I am a medical professional. 67/45 is not ""good"" anywhere I know; it's actually quite ""very not good"". No alarm either for bradycardia. I was very ill and had a pulse of 38; The app gave that a green light, too. The same can be said for the temperature ranges. 99.9 is green ""good"", but 100.0 is red ""bad"". No yellow range? What about adjusting for personal baselines? Mine is about 97.5. When I'm at 99.5, I have a fever. (2 degrees above baseline is a fever.) Why not save red ""bad"" for higher fevers and give a yellow ""caution"" range for low grade temps of 99.0 - 100.4 perhaps?

I was suspected the blood pressure monitor from the 1st time I used it. I changed my diet 6 months ago. Im a vegan for breakfast and lunch. For dinner, I eat a healthy meal. I’ve only gotten 2 sets of normal readings the entire time I’ve use the monitor. All other reading are stage 1 high and stage 2 high blood pressure readings. I knew that couldn’t be right, I would’ve had a heart attack by now. So today I go to the Naval Clinic and they take my blood pressure. Surprise it’s 77/125. That morning, before the appointment, my monitor showed 100/145. I think they need to work on this product a bit more.

Also, why is the “start” button inside a side menu? That is the most ridiculous place for the MAIN button in an app. This app is specifically for the iHealth monitor. But the button is hidden? That makes no sense. I would probably take my blood pressure more if the app worked like expected. Try doing a UX study. I guarantee you’ll need to change a LOT! 

Also your BMI is wrong. My BMI when accounting for body frame is 33, your app has me at 36. Also, Jsyk, BMI is a piss poor way of measuring obesity. You should probably remove it from the app. The more important measurement is hip to waist ratio with wrist circumference accounted for. Simply because belly fat is a bigger indicator of health issues than actually being obese by BMI standards. Dwayne Johnson is obese according to BMI.
