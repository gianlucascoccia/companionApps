1. Because the font is grey and tiny, it can be super hard to see especially in lower light scenarios.  Please enable the ability to increase the font and make it easier to see with higher contrast.
2. Allow for sorting of devices.  I know I can use groups but being able to sort the devices alphabetically or manually would be super helpful.
3. Continue to add icons for lights or allow us to upload a pic.  As an example, my garage has tube fluorescent lights and there isn’t a good icon. Neither for exterior house lights, fireplace etc.
4. Enable me to turn on a light and leave it on for x number of minutes/hours.
5. The app has become super slow.  Turning a light off or on is taking >30 seconds in some cases.  Turning services off is failing.  (I use ios).

The app is becoming increasingly obtuse and buggy. I used to be able to swear by it. Now, several times a day, sometimes several times a run, it asks me to turn on location at all times, which I don’t want or need. When this happens, I have to carefully read the message and respond (it freezes my app screen until I respond) before I can resume operations on the app. Once forever would have been enough. Then, sometimes it fails to measure my run, accurately tracking my map location and operating the timer, but not connecting the two, so I’ll be running a 99 minute mile before I notice it. And finally, not infrequently it simply quits operating mid-run and refuses to let me open any functionality until I restart my phone. These problems have occurred across multiple iPhones.

My biggest disappointment has come of recent with the discontinuation of IFTTT support. I’m sure it has to do with money, it’s always about money... but IFTTT really covered the spaces where pipers app lacked. One simple feature is just having a simple on/off time, geofencing is nice when it works... and come on guys, Life360 integration has been in beta for more than 3 years! Honestly the updates are bug fixes and that’s it, no advances in the usefulness of the app. The Home Vitals is a good feature, but it’s really just statistics, you can’t do anything with it, and it only keeps 48 hours at a time on record.

When I learned about this product (onelink sight and sound) I was immediately interested. The price point was a little steep but luckily I found it for 199 on Amazon.

The only issue I knew going into set up was the airplay 2 development issues.  So far so good no issues and I really don’t need to know too much unless my house is on fire so interacting with it via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth is not really the most important thing to me just knowing that it works.  The speaker is rich and good for a normal rooms sound.  Customer service was very helpful in my experience and I am not getting paid to leave this review!

I noticed in the gallery there were videos of someone’s kitchen and a dog playing...caption said she was impressed she could watch her dog play while she was in Canada. She would be not so impressed that I could see her dog play too. Finally got that deleted and attempted to contact support. No response. Next time I logged in, those images were gone. Used it a couple of times to check on dogs when we were not home, worked ok. But then, I was sitting in my kitchen and I heard the camera moving. I keep it facing the front door when not using and it moved and was looking at me. I thought it was my husband who also has access, but he swears it was not. I removed his access and faced the camera back at the door. I came home the next day and it was facing a different way. It went back in the box and has been in a closet ever since.

The vivofit has more activity tracking capabilities and I expected it would be more accurate on runs. 
Right from the start I found I couldn’t sync the watch to the app because the battery would be drained within 2 days. Not impressed by that at all. 

What has been my recent struggle is the heart rate accuracy when I track a cardio activity—this seems to be the best mode to put it in when I do weights. 
Some days it seems to be somewhat accurate in tracking my heart rate. More frequently my heart is pounding, I’m out of breath and this dumb thing says my heart rate is barely 80. This in turn means my calories burned is inaccurate. Of course I sync my watch while I’m working out. I find when my heart rate isn’t being tracked closing the app and reopening helps sometimes. But more often than not it doesn’t. This is extremely frustrating. 

The app is sluggish at best. I do find it Interesting that when I run it tracks my heart rate fine. So maybe it’s anaerobic activity it struggles with. But if it claims to have the capability to track an activity it should work—especially for the money.

For this I need to install an app on my phone???  Why not use the LCD touch screen on the device?

Oh, you require my location to run the app?  For an air filter??  Ok, I’ll temporarily unplug my wifi router from the internet and turn off cellular data and then allow location services for the app. After I turn off the bright light, I’ll delete the app so it can’t send my data to the Internet. 

Oh, *now* you want my email address???  For an air filter???  Dream on. 

I deleted the app and covered the light and the flashing wifi icon with electrical tape. Problem inelegantly solved.

Even so, I may never be able to use the purifier in my bedroom because of the remaining light from the screen and the inability to invoke night mode without the app.  (Seriously, does one need to use the app every night before bed to turn on night mode?  Does it have a darkness detector?  Why can’t I tap an icon for this?)

I feel an urge to return this pricey 7470i device in protest of this customer-hostile behavior.

Please consider the experience of your customers who do not want an Internet-of-things device.  The perpetually flashing wifi icon is both comical and unfortunate.  Maybe draw a line through it instead of making it flash at least?  Do that and replace the germ shield icon with a night mode icon and you’ll be golden.

Very confusing and annoying, and still happens sometimes for no yet known reason.

Got a dot that I thought was the one with clock (advertising showed) but it wasn’t yet out. So move that to another room with a battery base and got the dot with clock.

Also bought some smart plugs and they are AMAZING!! Wanted to smart setup entire house, but it is too old? Bought smart switches and learned wiring is missing a required fourth wire, so had to return. Very disappointed, but not worth the cost to retire entire house! Hahahaha.

I found the vents fit snug into my vent openings because they are shallow and the keen vent is tall.

I found the software confusing. I linked it with my Ecobee and room sensors and didn’t realize you have to click into the room then select “set temperature limit” then go back out to the home controls to set the optimal temperature for the room. Why not just provide 2 sliders or modes on the home controls screen? Optimal temperature limit and manual override opening/closing vents?

A min/max open threshold is a good idea as well. Not less than 10% but not more than 80% for example.

I also had issues getting the vent and smart bridge to communicate (on a desk next to each other) I had to power cycle the smart bridge several times to get it to connect.

I’ve just got the one vent installed in a room close to the smart bridge but was disappointed that I couldn’t get it to connect in the room down the hallway where I need the vent. It seems silly to have to buy repeaters in this day in age. It’s also confusing when my ecobee room sensors run off a coin battery and I have them throughout the house (far from the ecobee3 lite thermostat) and require no repeaters to work. Maybe this is the difference between Zigbee and z-wave? It feels like a scam to buy more smart bridges as repeaters when we have mesh WiFi and Bluetooth head phones that can connect thru many walls and floors.

If the reason Keen used Zigbee is low power, I’d rather buy a battery charger and recharge the batteries and replace them every 6months so the vents can run off a real wireless protocol like WiFi or Bluetooth vs. buying antiquated hardware repeaters.";2019-01-03 21:18:07-07:00;https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1052372493&type=Purple%20Software;1052372493;328;en;POSITIVE;0.2

It constantly crashes, never syncs with your watch, and you data that you manually enter is never saved. Which, given a lot of the target audience is typically not in places where there’s a constant connection, that’s an issue. (Outdoors in the wilderness, overseas, etc.) That’s the first thing.

The next is, I do not understand where the app gets its estimations, but running a mile does not burn 6000 calories. When you manually enter activities, it comes up with the outlandish calculations which by the way, overwrite your data if you try to fix it. The software needs to be fixed. 

Lastly, when I do have a connection, the app will use phone parameters to overwrite the settings I have set on the watch I use (Tactic Charlie). So when I set barometric pressures and altimeter settings manually based off of local reporting, somehow, whatever weather data my phone is receiving, overwrites what I manually input. That’s an issue if you’re actually using the watch for navigation...which it’s a GPS watch after all. 

Overall, it’s an okay app, but the constant issues make it a painful 1/10.";2019-06-29 22:13:47-07:00;https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=583446403&type=Purple%20Software;583446403;214;en;NEGATIVE;0.011363636363636364

I had a slight problem setting it up there was slight differences in the LED color that the directions explained versus what the actual color was for the setup process (the camera has an LED that can display in different colors). The live feed for me is only off by about a second or two off (not too bad). When I’m home I turn the camera off but there seems to be a delay when I turn it back on before it reconnects (about 3-4 minutes or so).

I’ve called customer support numerous times and they said it’s something wrong on their side and they will let me know when it’s been resolved. Well it has been months, and no solution! I am usually very understanding about these issues, but when several months go by and I literally can’t use this very expensive device (time is incorrect so all metrics are inaccurate), and the customer support has no idea when it will be resolved, it’s very frustrating to say the least. I wish there were some solution, like a way to manually set the time on the Fitbit so I could at least use it on its own, cause even normal clocks have this feature! Why not Fitbit?? This should be the number one issue that this company is focused on, because it is literally depriving so many customers from using their device and is a very large issue that has yet to be resolved in so many months. I would even go as far as to say that they should send their affected customers new devices or something. People work hard to buy these things with their money.

The user has no idea if it is working or not and has cryptic things like a “+” sign to add a speaker, with no labeling. Then when I did try to add my Aura 3, it says to connect with the cable or via Bluetooth. After connecting via Bluetooth, it gives no indication the connection is successful not does it move on automatically. The user is left to guess that he has to click “Step 2” which is grey like the rest of the interface (yeah, cool. Not.) and looks nothing like a button. 
On the next screen there is a button (ah, now a button) that says to Share Wifi settings. Click. Nothing. But the labels below say it will flash one thing when successful and twice (or something like that) when not successful. Seems it was not successful but nothing happened. 
Manual set up didn’t work any better. When it gets to the stage of searching for wifi networks, it “spins” endlessly without finding any networks. 

Unfortunately I bought my HK Aura 3 several months ago or I would return it. It sits on a shelf in my office. Very time I want to stream music to it I have to turn it on again. There appears to be no sleep mode. So, manually turn it on. Then reconnect to it in Bluetooth settings on the iOS device. Works great until the next session when I have to turn it on again. What’a the point of having a remote/streaming speaker if you have to do this every time? You might as well be tethered to it. 

Was hoping that the remote app would solve the problems of the hardware. It didn’t. Too bad. When it works it’s an ok speaker.

I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app on both android and apple devices, separately, and I tried resetting the switch by unplugging it and plugging it back in...  the app keeps saying that it cannot find my network and the dumb switch itself will turn on the lights briefly and then shut itself off.  This is a bad product and poorly constructed app, and is not worth your time or money.  I would rate this zero stars if I had the option.

This camera works when it wants to and has decided it didn’t want to work EVERY time I most needed it to. I just watched it NOT detect the very same motion it detects (when it FEELS like working) up to half a dozen times (for the SAME motion, which is better than when it doesn’t work at all) because when it DOES manage to work, it still refuses to work RIGHT. Oh, and when it does work at all, it takes about an hour to look through the videos because playback is often up to 10 times slower than real speed. 

And if you call their customer support, without even TRYING to determine the problem first, they try to get remote access to your computer. That might not be so suspicious, IF they actually tried to correct the problem before telling you they HAVE to to remote access your computer because you’re probably too stupid to figure it out on your own.

I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND AN ECOBEE PRODUCT TO ANYONE!!!!!!I 

Previous review; I have had a NEST thermostat for more than seven years and all I can say is was pretty much flawless. It just WORKS!  The ease of use and aesthetics are 5 out of 5 stars and the customer service (the only two times I had to call in all those years) is 10 stars. The ECOBEE is a whole different monster. Thermostat is confusing and the app is.... well in my opinion, fraught with problems. I’ve had my Ecobee since September because of a new HVAC install and the app is telling me it is still preparing my runtime report for October and November.  It’s had multiple issues so when I tried to contact customer service/tech support, I gave up after waiting 28 minutes on hold without ever speaking with a single person.

286;11;11;7519930238;1FSH1;https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id30936120;3.10;5;Love it!;We upgraded to a Honeywell smart thermostat many years ago. It was connected to older mechanicals at the time, so we didn’t get the total benefit of the app from the standpoint of being able to control humidity through it. That changed when we updated all of our mechanicals this year. We also went for zoned heating/cooling, meaning we have 1st and 2nd floor thermostats along with electric, automatic dampers in our duct work. So, now we have two smart thermostats and have control over temperature and humidity. The thermostats doo a great job of keeping the house at an even temperature from top to bottom regardless of the season. I love being able to control the temperature, in particular, via my phone or iPad. The app gives me good information as far as inside/outside temps, inside/outside humidity, if the system is actually running, what the set temperature is. And it gives me this for BOTH floors. Schedules can be customized for each floor through the app, too. I particularly like the app when we have been traveling. I usually put the the temperature on a vacation hold, so about an hour away from home, I like to cancel the hold so the house is comfortable when we walk in. So, great thermostats and great app to use them.;2021-06-29 10:08:57-07:00;https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=469517819&type=Purple%20Software;469517819;219;en;POSITIVE;0.006289308176100629

The only missing feature (and why I’m knocking off a star) is the development team opening this app up to Apple Silicon Macs as Blink has with their cameras (we also have several Blink cameras). One of my biggest complaints with both systems (and many other apps these days) was they’re only accessible from phones and tablets.

I’ve had a couple of the models and am always happy with the software. It’s the main reason why I’ve choosen fitbit over Apple or some other brand (and the price is much more approachable too). I will say that the hardware is lacking. The bands wear down rather quickly considering the price, and if they aren’t able to be swapped it’s a pain (ie charge 3). 

Unfortunately, ever since fitbit had that software flook where text notifications weren’t syncing (late 2019), I am unable to get them to my watch even with their troubleshooting instructions or any other remedy found online. I still love my fitbit charge 3, and they are in general a fantastic first step into smart watches, but I’m leaning towards other companies because of the lack of hardware integrity and recent software issues.

However, it is pretty cheesy that they lied about having a temperature sensor, and though they did honor their warranty on my first one which was defective, they told me that its replacement had no warranty at all, so I guess it’s just luck that the replacement is doing ok so far, otherwise it would’ve been a complete ripoff.";2019-12-05 08:53:29-07:00;https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1035457926&type=Purple%20Software;1035457926;147;en;POSITIVE;0.1

That being said I really enjoy the product that you produce. So I paid for a month and a year which is something you should fix as I feel a little duped as it is cheaper to just pay for the year, but it's paid. But after days of calling and not getting a response after I paid and the app and web interface would  not function I was severely upset to say it politely. I purchased another irrigation controller, Orbit B-Hyve, and decided to put off installing it for a few days in hopes you would do something to rectify the situation. I'm glad I procrastinated because the update on 06/18/2019 fixed my dilema and now I can return the other controller.

In the past 2 months maybe 3 times I’ve had to do the full Bluetooth, Phone, watch, shutdown restart. I’ve seldom had to resync. The software I think is amazing.

That function works perfectly. I’ve never used the calendar but it seems to keep track of me to some degree anyway. I normally am a “Big Brother” is out to get me.

Then I was leaving the house to go visit a friend for the weekend and wondered if I had remembered to start the dryer. I was already on the road, so I couldn’t check. The answer, of course, was that I hadn’t and my clothes smelled awful when I got home and I had to rewash them all. That’s when I realized the usefulness of the WiFi feature. 

All this to say, the app doesn’t work very well. It only works if the machines are turned on and there’s no way to remotely turn them on and they will turn off automatically after a period of time. Then on top of it, I can’t get the “smart control” to work. It keeps saying something is wrong with my router connection even when I’m standing right next to it.

I’ve used the Vera hubs for quite a few years now and very happy with them.  I like the ability to make my own luup code for specific scene conditions I may want to use as a trigger.  The forum has a ton of example code to use and learn from.   In the beginning you don’t need to do this but after a while you will love the fact that it is an option.  

Support has been very responsive whenever I need help.  I have no idea why there are so many negative reviews.   The reality is home automation is not always simple and you need to read forums occasionally to fix things.  

Bottom line is this product has been giving me rock solid performance for years. I have over 45 device ids and over 50 scenes and it just works.  Everything from integrating my existing dsc alarm system to full Alexa control over devices and scenes, to energy monitoring.   Vera engineering is always adding new devices so I see no reason to go anywhere else.

What a waste of money. The only positive comment I have is that the switches themselves look great. Other than that here are the things that aren’t great… - Three way switches keep losing their “pairing” to each other. So sometimes the paired switch is essentially dead. Which then causes all the lights on that circuit to not respond to the app on my phone or in wall scene controllers. Seems to happens randomly. - App is glitchy. Sometimes the app shows specific lights are off when they are on and vice versa. Must repeatedly tap the on off “slider” on the app for each switch to “wake up” the switches. - App has trouble connecting to the hub. Cue the spinning wheel of death! This is not an issue with my phone or WiFi. I have no trouble connecting to my Lutron hub (I have since started using Lutron Caseta plugs for table lamps and LOVE the Lutron product) - In wall scene controller or a scene from app must be activated repeatedly to set all of the lights on a scene. Lights are set in a random order EVERY TIME and I never know which light is going to be skipped by a controller so I have to go room to room to make sure each light was set properly defeating the purpose of a one touch programmed scene! - Hub must often be rebooted to get anything to work from app and/or scene controller (requires unplugging or inserting a pin into a tiny hole in back of a device that is hidden in a cabinet with other equipment). What a pain! I’m tired of being a contortionist to get my overpriced lighting system to work. This app seemed to get more glitchy when Legrand shifted away from Artik cloud to their own Eliot cloud remote access system. (I spent hours on the phone with technical support trying to figure out how to get my programming from artik to Eliot to no avail.) I’ve kept the app updated and routinely reboot WiFi and my phone and I do not have issues with any of my other smart home equipment or interfaces. Seems like Legrand engineering missed the boat and left all of its customers standing on the dock with them. Next project I’m going with Lutron. Legrand it would be nice if you helped my existing switches be more than just nice looking wall decor. Right now they are pretty dumb. Nothing smart about them.;2021-12-06 22:55:31-07:00;https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1017835513&type=Purple%20Software;1017835513;435;en;POSITIVE;0.034482758620689655

I think it could be a bit more sleek looking but it does what it sets out to do very well. I like that you can adjust the geo fences range, and how it cuts the AC on for you so when your driving home it will start to cool the house before you get there. That has saved us about $50 a month on our electric bill. Also being able to name the geo fence rocks. It’s always nice when it pops up and tells you and your partner when the other has entered DA CHILL ZONE, which is what I named ours. Also nice knowing the other person has made it home safe or our close to being home.

I have also tried connecting the thermostat to Apple HomeKit to see if it worked better than  Alexa but I can't even get HoneKit to recognize the thermostat.  So now I am forced  to find my  phone or walk over to the thermostat to make any changes- which totally defeats the purpose of spending money on a higher priced smart assistant enabled device.  Not to mention the latest update to the app made making any temperature changes a lot more confusing.  It was so easy before.

The problem here is I don’t adjust my thermostat at the same time every day and to the exact same temperature.   So I’m often finding myself at some random time saying why am I so cold? Or so hot?   I go and check the temperature to find out that nest decided I wanted it warmer (or colder) because last Tuesday I set the temperature.   But it then resets it to Wednesday’s temperature the next day (which may be different).
Nest does have a schedule where you can set the temperature but often, if you randomly adjust it for say a party or a dinner with friends nest will yet again decide that this is the preferred temperature at that time so next Friday be prepared to have your heat suddenly turn off ( or the AC)

Overall the device is just over thought.    Temerpature doesn’t need to be this complex.";2020-11-15 23:41:08-07:00;https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=464988855&type=Purple%20Software;464988855;203;en;POSITIVE;0.011627906976744186

The app works seamlessly it took 2secs to connect and a little time to play around with the adjustments to your liking… I suggest putting it on acclimate depending on your previous lighting equipment.

The basic interface remained the same for the 6 years that I used it. The biggest draw to this alarm ecosystem was the DIY aspect and no monthly charges. I speak of all this in past tense because according to its website,  iSmart Alarm products are no longer supported and app functionality is being transferred to a third party company without guarantee of continued functionality. So those of us who invested considerably in their starter system and add-on offerings are understandably concerned that they invested in equipment that is being deprecated before our eyes. I found all this out, not by a courteous email from iSmart Alarm but when my system just stopped working. The third party “meShare” who will be supporting the hardware through their app for a year, does not guarantee functionality of the equipment. And even if the hardware eventually starts interfacing with the app and they continue free service and support past 12 months, they might switch to a monthly fee system which puts a nail in the coffin of what made this system special and worth it in the first place.;2021-02-03 10:37:25-07:00;https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=615159814&type=Purple%20Software;615159814;209;en;POSITIVE;0.005434782608695652

But when I opened it it again said I needed to load the latest version.  I am now in a continuous never ending loop where I download the latest compatible version only to be told to again load the latest version of the app.  When I finally got through to their customer service I was told my IPad could no longer be used since it made my Canary insecure in that someone could hack into it and view what is on the camera.  I told customer service I didn't care who saw the image since I only use the camera when I go on vacation and all it views is my front door.  I ask the customer service person how can I download the previous compatible version albeit ""non-secure"" version of the app so I can again use my bought and paid for Canary.  I was told there was no way for me to do that and instead I had to buy a new IPad.   Could you believe this?  Stay away from Canary.

The nest app has the ability to have multiple phones manage the geo fencing for “away” settings.  The lutron app does not seem to do this well since both phones must log in with the same “user”.  When away was part of Nest that set the away modes properly in lutron.  Works with nest is dead and lutron has yet to switch over to the new Google home methods.   I’ve got over 50 devices and love the system but this lack of catching up to Google Nest new requirements is annoying.

What’s more odd is lutron IS tied into Google home so why has that not been simply connected to the naive iOS app?  Clearly the integration is there and would reconnect things for smart away and scene usage.  The connection is there just not via this iOS app so why not just fix it?";2020-11-04 03:23:28-07:00;https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=886753021&type=Purple%20Software;886753021;179;en;NEGATIVE;0.030303030303030304

Sonos is more interested on providing a music service via their APP. They continuously update their firmware and APP interface to keep up with the latest computer and mobile technology.

Well here is the problem. Early Sonos customers will eventually not be able to play their music from their favorite playlist or Steaming service of its not entered into an agreement with Sonos to be on their APP. Thus eventually you will end up being phased out and thus your speakers will be obsolete and of no use to you. Unless of course if you go and purchase new hardware to keep up with their firmware updates they force you to download to your device.  Every time you end up downloading a update you are gambling that your device will be able to handle it.  If not you are SOL 

They are more interested in you buying the speakers to have you locked into their Sonos APP service, where think they are Making their money. 

A true WiFi speaker will allow you to play your music from any computer or mobile device, regardless of how old your WiFi  operating and hardware systems are.

The recent software update did bring improvements such as the day review and automatic updates, but the camera’s are still buggy.

I inherited 2 more cameras from a friend recently and I found that all 3 of these cameras all use the same network name leading to some difficulties setting up. Also I found when viewing both from the app then switching immediately over to the integrated home app, one of the Cramer’s crashes every time requiring a hard power reset. The app isn’t bad getting around in but it takes WAY too many clicks on the GUI to get to any recordings from the cameras: see Nest or even the super smooth interface from Apples own Time Machine on MacOSX!

Another big hit is the inability to provide notifications only when you are not at home. Sure the new app has a button to press for away, but this all needs to be automated: also see Nest.

I hope the updates to both the firmware for the cameras and features for the apps continue to be released by D-link, as well as HomeKit capability improvements from Apple.

After a month and several attempts, I think I finally got eack of them to map about 90% of the house.  So far the units do not share the same map that I can figure out.  Sharing maps would be helpful as the vacuum covers the house way faster and easier than the Braava M6.

When editing the map the app attempts to save after every divider edit.  Each save takes 45 seconds to a minute and often times out without saving.  Adding exclusion zones is nearly impossible as the system times out after each attempt to save the zone. Much improvement is needed.

On the devices themselves.  I like that the s9 empties itself. The negative is that it cannot seem to crawl onto area rugs or mats to clean them-instead it just pushes them and many times just gets stuck.  I used to have a Neato Botvac.  It had no trouble climbing onto area rugs, bath mats or kitchen mats, but it did not empty itself.  All in all I think the Neato cleaned better, but often needed it’s filter cleaned and dumped—thus the reason we changed to Roomba.  Still not sure if it was the right choice.  On the Braava M6-when you get it to wet mop it does a good job.  It has a hard time climbing off of its base to get started. The wheels just spin on the plastic sometimes and I have to help it off to start.";2021-07-08 21:54:32-07:00;https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1012014442&type=Purple%20Software;1012014442;261;en;POSITIVE;0.013888888888888888
