No smart lock is perfect and they all have flaws but from my experience the Kēvo hands down was the best option for my family and I. They even give you a option of buying key fobs to use instead of your smart phone. I purchased 2 and use them in addition to my smartphone and 9 times out of 10 & works flawlessly. If you are have connection issues just read the manual thoroughly and follow directions accordingly! They also have a 800 number if you need guidance. \n\nDear Kwikset please consider HomeKit for your 3rd Gen Kēvo! 👍🏼","updated":"2017-02-20T09:47:59-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=685604951&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"6624060568","userName":"k28dan","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1096523052","version":"3.6.1","score":1,"title":"Mediocre","text":"Buyers remorse","updated":"2020-11-08T15:41:48-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=685604951&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1471650828","userName":"Sick Pigeon","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id66239","version":"1.5.7","score":4,"title":"Sometimes works perfect, sometimes","text":"I have had the app and lock a few months. I love the lock but it does have a learning curve. When I first set up the lock with my phone I set the proximity too close meaning I often had to pull my phone out and hold it close to the lock. When I purchased the gateway I reset everything including my proximity a good arms length away (I'm 6'2\") and now I can touch my lock and activate it farther away, not usually a problem. The added benefit is leaving the house and not always have to be facing the lock and waiting for it to lock. But sometimes I still do. I have noticed if my phone is in my pocket and screen is facing my body, I need to be very close to the lock. This may be due to my heavy protective case. Another thing I've noticed about the lock, sometimes I touch it and it doesn't sense that I did. After making sure I didn't turn into a vampire, I learned that if I rub my fingers quickly and touch the lock it senses them. I don't have particularly cold hands often. I'm happy with how the app functions but haven't updated my phone to latest iOS because I heard it doesn't work as well yet. I don't use my fobs so no input there. I hope to see this lock system grow and expand features, not sure what more I want yet though.","updated":"2016-10-23T04:10:24-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=685604951&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1396639795","userName":"Westcoast619","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id103845485","version":"1.4.33","score":1,"title":"Useless- Waste of money","text":"A long time ago (3 updates ago) this used to work on the second try like 40% of the time.

I can lock and unlock my keyvo sometimes but it takes like 1-2 minutes to connect and unlock or lock. I thought it would be useful when it \"updates\" the status of the lock but it's not accurate. More than half the time it will give me bad info. It says the lock is \"unlocked\" then my kids try to open the door and they yell at me \"It's locked dad!\" So I hit the \"lock\" on my phone so it can \"unlock\" the door and 1-2 minutes later it unlocks the door.

If you use the iPhone’s bluetooth for any other task, such as music at home, Kevo seems to lose its control of bluetooth every time, even though “sharing” is active. Other apps are not “sharing” at all, just taking over completely. If I turn off bluetooth after use, “force quit” Kevo in background, then re-launch everything, it restores reliable Kevo function. (My husband uses an Apple watch, so he has given up using Kevo entirely.)\n\nNone of that changes my opinion that Kevo is a great household tool. I think the person who used it for commercial application is an idiot - there are digital combination deadbolts that can be programmed for multiple users, that are more secure, robust, and reliable.

When phone is in my back pocket I usually have to turn my backside to the door or take it out of my pocket to get it to unlock. And there is a short delay of  a few seconds before it unlocks but no more than it would take if I were putting a key in the lock and turning it. The lock/unlock history is not useful to me since both the key fob and the electronic key are registered in my name. It would be nice if I was able to assign unique names to key fobs and eKeys.

Now this app is supposed to work as long as it remains open in the background but that is about as dependable as the weather man. It might work but it's probably not going to and if it's poring rain you can bet your life it's not going to work. Now I guess every time I come home I could pull my phone from my pocket and open the app, but seems to me if that were the case it would be just as easy to use a key and certainly cheaper than buying a lock that cost $200. To make matters worse the lock never seems to fail after you've unlocked the door and are walking in, because if you accidentally bump the lock it will lock and the exposed bolt then slams into the molding around the door as you close it, dinging it up really nice for you.

(Good because if it doesn't open, it usually just takes a second try, but if I left the house and it didn't close, I wouldn't necessarily know until I returned later.)\n\nI'm very happy with the app. \nThe only thing I dislike is the extra fee for additional e-keys. This seems unnecessary on a $200+ lock, when the marginal cost for them to give out more keycodes is essentially 0.","updated":"2015-03-16T15:24:44-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=685604951&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1288695558","userName":"Kevo is bad 9654376547","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id174989842","version":"1.4.27","score":1,"title":"Don't bother","text":"Kevo continually gets worse with updates. Our fob no longer works. My husband gets logged out of the app every time I log in and vice versa. You have to keep it running in the background while logged in for it to work. I've been locked out of my house for a couple of hours at night when it wouldn't work. Customer service, of course, is only available during regular business hours. Always always carry a real key just in case. It would be nice if it could tell your phone/key was inside the house, so when going in and out if someone accidentally touched the lock it doesn't lock. That gets annoying. Not worth a penny we spent on this lock. Holding out for Apple to come out with home automation.","updated":"2015-11-19T05:20:36-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=685604951&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"3180724193","userName":"dnod","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id24014272","version":"3.0.1","score":4,"title":"Much Better since update/calibrate","text":"I performed the calibration as per notification on update and the app works 100% better now. Will operate lock fairly consistently while in my pocket. So far so good. \n\nPrevious review:\nI have used this lock for several years now, always hoping the app would improve. My wife couldn’t deal with it, uses key. \nI have been very tolerant. I carry no key and have never been locked out of my home. It always worked, eventually. With iOS 11 it just doesn’t work. I am going to have to put the key back on my ring. \nMy only complaint until now has been reliability. You never know if it will work or not. I pretty much try it once and go right to taking my phone out my pocket. It would always work after pulling up the app, only sometimes in background. \nNow, it is basically broken. Needs update ASAP or I may as well put back my old lock.","updated":"2018-09-12T02:45:34-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=685604951&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"2542948829","userName":"desonos","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id24323040","version":"2.1.1","score":1,"title":"Good hardware, bad app","text":"Like my Kēvo, and have Kevo plus; the last year or two of the app, however, is basically hot garbage. Doesn't seem to stay open in the background reliably (or otherwise doesn't function in the background), often crashes to springboard when opening. Have been using since ~iPhone 4a or so, and have had every phone in between. App has been terrible since around my iPhone 6.\n\nPlus functionality works well and is reliable, as is the Fob we have. This is with both a 1st gen and 2nd gen lock.\n\nAlso, where's my Watch app? My guess is Apple doesn't allow them the access they'd need to unlock via Bluetooth, but they could at least allow me to use my watch to unlock via kevo plus.","updated":"2018-05-13T12:50:40-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=685604951&type=Purple%20Software"}]
