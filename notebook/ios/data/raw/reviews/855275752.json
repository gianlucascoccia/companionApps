Today, it started giving me wild results, but when I went into the app to delete the data, that no longer works. So I tap delete, but the data point remains. I had to go into Health app to delete multiple data types, and still the scale is registering me as a different member of the household, with no way to correct it.

This monitor has several great features, my favorite is the option to store daily heart and blood pressure results. When I went to my last cardiovascular exam I took my Qardio monitor and was able to show my personal physician my crazy blood pressure readings with the Qardio app on my cell phone, which helped him evaluate the need for additional prescriptions. The attending nurse loved my monitor so much that she decided to buy one for her father. Other features of the Quardio blood pressure and heart monitor app are: a place to write a brief note about what contributed to your reading result, an option to allow another person to use your monitor without interfering with your personal results, scale readings for your blood pressure or heart readings, alarm option to remind you to check your blood pressure or take medication, a waves heart emoji when your heart isn't beating normally, and a place where you can enter contact information allowing your Qardio app to call your physician or caregiver or family member if you are having health issues. With this app you can send all of your monitor readings to your personal physician by phone. You will appreciate the fact that you can contact the makers of this app through the app to make suggestions or report problems.
