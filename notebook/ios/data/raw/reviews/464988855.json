First, it was very easy to install. The instructions are easy to follow; I did not have to do any rework. I did not have to hire a professional. Programming the controls was also easy with step by step instructions. I like the fact that it self programs economic settings based on when you’re home. I’m single and working so it’s nice to know it is saving me money by reducing back the heating and cooling temps when I’m not home. And it does it automatically through a sensor that detects motion. This could, however, be a problem if you have a big dog. You can also control the settings using your smart phone, which is what I do pretty much all the time. I can even control it from work and by using Google voice. This system requires a dependable WiFi. If the WiFi goes off line, however, as it has done with me a few times, the system will still function but you won’t be able to control it from you smart phone. Once the WiFi is back on line, the thermostat will automatically resume previous settings. And best of all, it has saved me hundreds of dollars in utility savings. And it looks sharp on the wall. Well worth the money, and so easy for DIY’ers. Definitely worth a five-state rating!!","updated":"2021-10-23T05:20:31-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=464988855&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5826022476","userName":"Firemanndave","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id260078387","version":"5.47.5","score":5,"title":"Replacement Thermostats","text":"I’ve had Honeywell internet-compatible thermostats in my house for nearly six years, and they just stopped communicating with the internet after multiple calls with service.  Luckily I got them at Costco!  Costco returned them with no issues, and they also happened to have Nest thermostats available too.  So I got a full refund for the old thermostats, and bought two new Nest Version 3 thermostats (as my house is divided into two areas).  Replacing the first thermostat took a little longer than the second, as it was just getting to know how the unit works and confirming the wire schematic.  The first unit connected to my router with no problems, but the second one kept failing at first.  I ended up temporarily moving the second unit to the first unit’s location and got it to connect.  After I moved it back to its correct location, it was still connecting ok.  \n\nThe only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars was that the actual application kept disconnecting after both thermostats were connected, and several times during installation.  It’s almost like it reset, and you’d have to start the install from the beginning again with the Nest app.","updated":"2020-04-17T11:53:04-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=464988855&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5968349966","userName":"Yimmy291","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id120402990","version":"5.50.0","score":3,"title":"Needs hold feature and to be night shift worker friendly","text":"Don’t get me wrong I love nest and nest products they are great.

But this app is a huge disappointment. It has such a high latency rate - you open the app and it takes 45 seconds to load up to the main menu. (It’s not my wifi or cellular connection) So let’s consider this: your doorbell rings. You open the app, wait 45 seconds, then navigate to the doorbell where you can access the microphone and begin talking. At that point, the interaction time has been about 55 seconds. Most people, after ringing a doorbell, won’t stay at the door that long, thus by the time I can finally get to the mic the person is gone and the feature is no longer useful. Additionally, it’s a pain to guard nest guard with the app. I’ll tap the shield and it will load for 30 seconds and then say it can’t connect. I do it again. Can’t connect. After 5 or 6 times it will FINALLY arm the system. A last complaint I have is that nest is no longer integrated with HomeKit. It was previously before the company was purchased by Google. I get that Google instead wants you to use the Google home system however, as an avid Apple user, it’s frustrating to have to use 2 systems. We chose Nest because the physical products are far beyond the competition but there are some serious rooms for improvement for this application. Reduce network calls on app launch, considering auditing latency for the app and see where the problem lies, and please integrate with HomeKit.","updated":"2020-10-17T06:18:33-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=464988855&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"7264995381","userName":"John Alden","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id101720895","version":"5.60.0","score":5,"title":"Great, intuitive, useful app for a great product (Nest thermostat).","text":"I bought this thermostat at the same time I replaced my HVAC system a couple weeks ago, but I wish I'd gotten one sooner.

It’s fine, but it’s not connected to the other two sensors and it seems that’s part of the benefit as they are supposed to work together. \n\nOne final point. If your electric goes out, you have a 1-2 hour back up battery. After that you have no heat. I have not tested this but thats important to know if you are dealing with heavy winter storms. I was surprised that the back up battery was not of longer duration. Seems like an easy solve. \nI would recommend keeping either your old thermostats in case you need them in an emergency or having some way to charge the nest faceplate if you had to.

It has buttons that are apparently useless, or if they do do something, then they’re missing stuff. I’m talking about the ‘copy week’ button. What weeks? There is no month view, there is no ‘next week’ or ‘previous week’ button, there is no ‘make this the default’ option. So when I go through and individually set every temperature (a process just begging for some sort of convenience feature), I am rewarded by having it completely garbled the following week when for some reason the app tries to merge my changes with what it thought that next week should be, resulting in 30 minute windows of the temperature I actually wanted. And of course there’s no option to turn off the schedule feature and just leave it at a set manual temperature. \n\nI bought this house with a Nest already in it, and I will be removing it in favor of a competitor that has some semblance of quality control in their interface design.","updated":"2019-12-02T08:13:37-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=464988855&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5124421950","userName":"Frustrated with Google Nest","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id933872450","version":"5.41.0","score":3,"title":"Not real happy with Google Nest","text":"Before Google got involved with Nest it seems my Nest cameras and thermostat connect with my iPhone very well.

We had been using Nest for years and Google stepped in, bought the company, and is now ruining what was an awesome product. Used to use Nest as our crib cam, but now had to buy a video baby monitor because the Nest app became unusable. If you haven't upgraded to Nest Aware, the app works terrifically. It started crashing immediately after we upgraded the service. This is all over their forums and they have not addressed it for months--keeping in mind they have all the resources on the world, it is clear that addressing this is not a priority.

For some reason when you set up \"routines\" and set up location with Google Home it also fixes the issues with Home/Away not working well in the Nest App.","updated":"2021-09-16T17:34:16-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=464988855&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"7771575303","userName":"edp606","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id860365071","version":"5.66.0","score":3,"title":"Tired rating 1 star in app and it freezes.","text":"Has anyone else had a bad experience with Nest?

It is a temperature nazi. It doesn’t follow your preferences, but follows what it deems you need to be comfortable from its perspective.

Facebook messages go unread after they told me to private message them (nine days ago), no response on Twitter, contacted a different rep and she did nothing since I already have a case open, email is answered with nothing but “it’s at the highest escalation department”.  Awful. To add salt to the wound, a package was stolen off my porch and I have zero proof. Save yourself the headache and go with Ring or Arlo.","updated":"2020-01-30T16:57:07-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=464988855&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5427028570","userName":"richard14428","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id16876060","version":"5.42.0","score":2,"title":"The software is buggy","text":"Despite several repeated calls to Nest it still doesn’t know when I’m home or away.

Hope they listen.","updated":"2021-11-29T12:01:45-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=464988855&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"7748974443","userName":"RizzoGS","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id41614702","version":"5.66.0","score":5,"title":"Thermostats and doorbells","text":"The app takes a few seconds to load, and seems like an eternity when you’re trying to view whos at the door via the doorbell camera.

I called Nest support and was told it is an internet connection problem although all three devices are close to each other with the camera closest to the router.  Then I was told to take down the camera to run some test on it, since I am 80 years old, that means hiring a handyman at $50/hr to take down the camera for me.  I don’t want to spend that $100 + dollars so the camera remains non working most of the time.

This functionality is great, but when I’m away I would like the ‘away’ function to supersede the daily schedule. Last weekend I realized the heat kept kicking up during the day even though I had marked ‘away’, and I wasted a lot of energy. If I’m gone, the app should recognize that and not turn the heat back up according to my regular schedule.

The summary display that shows all of the thermostats with their current temperatures doesn’t update in real time. Quite annoying.\n\n2. The humidity reading appears to be very inaccurate. I sometimes use evaporative cooling and knowing the humidity is very important. I bought a separate temperature and humidity device that I believe more because of the national weather information comparison. The Nest is way off, reporting much higher levels. \n\nI write this review to provide feedback to the developers. Hopefully they will find a way to correct these deficiencies.

I’m just looking for superior.","updated":"2020-06-14T06:38:21-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=464988855&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5454740990","userName":"Almost perfct","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id166471580","version":"5.42.0","score":4,"title":"Very good, but missing one feature","text":"I’ve had my Nest Thermostat for years now and am very happy with it.
