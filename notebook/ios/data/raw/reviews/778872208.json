I'm sure others' mileage will vary. In my current setup with the door bell location everything works great. The bell sits in the shade so no false alarm from the sunrise and sunset. No trees to move with the wind and far away from the street that cars and their lights don't trigger the motion sensor. It's pretty awesome actually. In my own non scientific experiments the doorbell picked me walking towards the door and as soon I got close it rang the bell! The skybell played a door chime from the device itself letting visitors know that people in the house have been notified about your presence. So for any would be burglar, this is an alarm before the security alarm that will be triggered only after the break in. \nAlso in my current setup both physical install and wifi pairing took less than 20 minutes. Given that any prior technology upgrades I've done before (nest, ADT pulse) were a major thing this was a welcome change. \nA promised update from the company is video clip storage on their server for review later when you miss the door ring will be another great layer in security. Today we were at the mall and when I checked my phone I saw a notification from skybell that someone was at the door 33 minutes prior.

The idea and the execution is simply put Brilliant. A few things to consider, people are complying about the 15second motion sensor, these people obviously don't leave their houses frequently. you do not want a motion sensor ringing your door bell and sending you messages everytime you walk outside your house. That's crazy, the 15 sec motion is perfect in my opinion. The fact that I can speak to people from anywhere is mind blowing!!  UPS or fedex can hit the doorbell and from Italy I can ask the delivery guy to put the package by the door, or if they say we need a signature I can say please have my package held at the faculty for pickup this evening. Or if someone is testing you home to see if anyone is home? You can reply can I help you? They have no clue if your home regardless if they know about the technology or not. I could go on and on with scenarios on why this product is amazing, yes I'm still waiting for on demand access to the camera.

This one connected with no problems and has been working fine for the last month.  I don't dread those late night doorbell rings where my wife and I would just hit the floor and pretend that nobody was home. We would try to peek out the curtains to see who it was. It was getting ridiculous.  Now with Skybell I just tell them I'm washing the Pit bull and I can't get to the door. It's also nice to use the live video to see if the snow guys came.  I've been waiting for something to come out where I could see and talk to people from inside the house without having to install an intercom system. Skybell simply hooks up to the low voltage doorbell wires and it's ready to go.

I used to miss guests all the time when I am in the backyard and can't hear the door - Now it sends a notification to my phone and I can direct my guest to come around to the back or wait a minute.\n2. I can see that there are solicitors at the door so I can hide...or pretend I'm not home. Skybell used to ding on the doorbell itself when you connected to it - alerting the person that you can see them - they have fixed that now so you can see who's at the door with perfect stealth. As my husband (who's at work) surprised me when I was getting video of the doorbell and he started talking to me through it! He then sent me pictures he took of me getting video of the doorbell. Nice, babe...\n3. Which brings me to the point that my husband loves that he can see what's going on at the house. Yesterday, nobody was home and there was a special delivery. Hubby was able to direct the delivery guy to give the package to our neighbor.\n4. I have a new baby and this is sooo PERFECT for seeing who's at the door so I'm not disturbing my baby by running to the door for nothing. It also lets me see if there are packages at the door.\n5. Sometimes I'm just busy or can't get to the door quickly and people will keep ringing the doorbell, knock frantically, or leave. Now I can just ask them to hold on a minute and they settle down knowing someone is coming.\n6. I have the option to disable the doorbell so my baby's nap times are not disturbed and I don't have to worry about hanging up angry \"Baby Napping - PLEASE DO NOT RING THE DOORBELL!\" signs on my front door. Not that people even pay attention to those signs anyways. This feature is true love. Being able to turn on/off your home doorbell with just a swipe of my finger. Love it!!\n7. Being a stay-at-home-Mom, I really appreciate being able to see who's at the door for security purposes too. There are so many reports now of people knocking at the door to see who's home (now you can take a picture of them) or charging in once you open the door...there are just so many crazies out there...it's great to have this to help stay safer. The next step up would be get a full blown security system with cameras, etc...but that is way more expensive and more involved to get set up and installed. It's important to note that this product is not designed to be a security system - if you try to compare it to those standards, you will be disappointed. It's meant for you to just be able to see/talk to your guests at the door. Having said that though - the company is well aware of additional features that could make this doorbell help with security type issues and they are going in that direction. Look for those in upcoming models. I believe it will be stuff like being able to connect to a Cloud system so when the motion detector is tripped, it will record a short clip and save it to the Cloud for your retrieval.\n8. The doorbell is always connected to WiFi and so you can initiate a call with it whenever and wherever. I know hubby likes knowing when there are people at the door when we're not home. I've also used it when I'm out and about running errands and I want to check to see if my package has arrived yet so I know if I should hurry home or not. The company also sends out updates to the doorbell. Since having it, they've sent out a couple of updates that I know of. 1 fixed the issue of the doorbell ringing when you initiated a call - love that they silenced it now! 2. Changed the sensitivity of the perimeter sensor so that it's not so sensitive - I'm not happy with this change because now it misses sometimes. But they made this change because of the complaints that it was too sensitive. In the future, they will make it so that you can control the sensitivity - that would be great!! 3. There was an update to the Skybell app, changing the appearance, buttons, etc. .\n9. I like that I can see in my \"Notifications\", the last 10 times when Skybell has alerted me.\n\nThis device basically allows you to Face-time your doorbell. You can see and talk to whoever is at the door. You install it in place of your existing doorbell. Installation is not hard, but it's a bit of a pain just because there's not a lot of room to stuff wires back in. But once it's installed, you don't have to worry about it so it's not a big deal. It needs to connect to your WiFi. Try to get the strongest signal possible to your Skybell. Even though we met the minimum requirements, video was laggy, it took forever to connect, it acted buggy, and the video quality was very poor. These all were fixed once we got a WiFi Extender to strengthen the signal to the doorbell. We needed to do this anyways because our Router is in the bedroom and we never did get good signal in the living room/kitchen. Now we have good connectivity throughout the house.\n\nThings to note:\n\nThe video quality is not that great - but it's perfectly functional. I believe they are working on a new model with HD quality video. The video quality now is slightly worse than my Summer's Infant and Motorola Baby Monitors - but I believe it's a smaller camera as well. It's definitely good enough to identify people and see what they are doing though.\n\nWe had a few days of intense winds and the motion detector kept going off - just turn off the motion detector until winds die down.\n\nMake sure the sun doesn't shine directly at the doorbell. Towards the evening, the setting sun shines right at the doorbell and then I can't use the video until the sun sets a little more.\n\nI can't really think of any cons of this product. There are limitations, but even looking at some of the reviews from just a couple of months ago - they've already addressed those issues and improved the product and they aren't stoppi","updated":"2015-02-14T15:08:36-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=778872208&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1297097948","userName":"Burak Topuz","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id85011291","version":"1.7.4","score":1,"title":"No notifications on ios9 still!!!","text":"Just do yourself a favor amd stay away from this company!!!","updated":"2015-12-06T20:53:04-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=778872208&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1259245374","userName":"SiliconValleyMaverick","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id6543618","version":"1.7.1","score":1,"title":"iOS9 breaks skybell","text":"After upgrading to iOS9 skybell app has no audio and app crashes.

A cool thing to have","text":"I give the SkyBell Video doorbell 5 stars because it's cool to have. The installation was a little headache. First we configured the voltage for the door bell, then we tried to make it fit, but the wires that come with the door bell don't fit in the tight box. We have it sort of installed, please see the pictures. Also neither are there any instructions on how to put the round things that make the camera tilt. I would advice people to have an electrician put this up, for example if the voltage is not right it can burn your house down.\n\nThe sensor seems to be very sensitive. Last night it was windy and rainy and the door bell went off. I immediately looked at the SkyBell app and there was no one there. I live in a remote wooded area and my house is very hard to find, I went to the door just to check if someone was lost, nope no one. The emotion sensor had picked up the motion from the wind or the rain. \n\nThis is very good for me to have. I broke my ankle and tib/fib two years ago and the whole thing is a mess. I still can't walk much. So unfortunately for me, the less steps I take the less pain I have. So I give SkyBell 5 stars. I love it.\n\nThe good news is that after you download the app, it's not hard at all from there. You put in the serial number, your wifi passcode and sync it for few minutes. Then when someone rings your door bell, it rings on you iPad or what ever gadget you use and you go to SkyBell app. It takes a few moments for the video at your front door to come up but the sound is gritty although clear and the picture quality is rather poor and skips frames. But after all I'm pretty excited about this bell, it's way better than not having one.","updated":"2015-02-05T15:01:32-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=778872208&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"975982270","userName":"Maimonides Brew","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id21250927","version":"1.2","score":5,"title":"Stellar","text":"Love the app, love the product.","updated":"2014-04-12T11:53:22-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=778872208&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"964027816","userName":"Llpeders","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id102589456","version":"1.2","score":1,"title":"Basically just a doorbell","text":"This app does pretty much nothing.

Why do I want a video of something I have already seen!?  This is useless unless you need evidence for some reason.  I want video to start as soon as motion is detected or the bell is pushed, whichever comes first, and stop after motion stops / person is gone.  I want to see who's been on my porch or at my door when I couldn't answer...I suspect they just don't want to fill up their server with too much video, but this is a deal breaker in my opinion. \n\n2) No connectivity to your phone app when internet is down, makes sense when you're away from home, but is also true even when your phone and Skybell are on the same network.  Doorbell does still ring as a normal bell, but no video or app connectivity without your ISP.  It needs to be updated so that it can work directly over the local network when the app is running on a local device.\n\n3) App says there is poor signal and video stops after a few seconds, but I can confirm that putting my phone against the wall next to it I get full signal and a speed test shows 15Mbps down, 6Mbps upload speed to the internet, well above the 1.5Mbps they say is required. \n\n4) Some kind of API would be nice, or maybe a PC application that could host videos locally without an Internet connection needed.  It's just my porch so privacy is maybe a minor issue, but I really want this to work better without depending on Comcast...\n\nI was excited about this thing so much that I spent a day installing all of the other doorbell stuff - transformer, drill a hole in the floor from the basement, fish wires thru the wall, mount a bell - just so I'd have the infrastructure for this device.  Now I'm kicking myself.  \n\nIf I don't see signs of support and software update development Im thinking I'll return it and wait till state of the art is better (or develop my own)!

Skybell blocked me so I wasn’t able to comment or like on their post. This was back in 2013. Now 2 years later I went to the company’s website to purchase the new version because the first one have a lot of issues and some features are not functioning properly. After placing my order the payment was refunded to me and item never shipped. I contacted Skybell customer service for a week twice a day to find out what is the issue and why is that happened. No one customer representative was able top give me an answer. I was told they will let the supervisor know to look into the issue and let someone will get back to me. Did I mention I called for a week twice a day? I was able to talk to a customer service representative on January 29 and I was told that I am blocked from Skybell because of my comments on their Facebook site. I was not even able to make any comment for almost 3 years so how is that possible they telling me I violated their terms? When I left my comments in 2013 this company doesn’t even have any Terms yet. I asked to speak to a supervisor so the representative place me on hold. After a while he came back and told me that the supervisor refused to talk to me or call me back and no one at the company will talk to me because I am on their blacklist and I should not call them anymore.","updated":"2015-02-06T11:33:09-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=778872208&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"930485252","userName":"Sandeepkk","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id214785828","version":"1.0.1","score":1,"title":"Need hardware","text":"I have been waiting for hardware.

However, there are a few issues, which keeps it from reaching that potential at the moment. Before I give my review let me preface it by saying that I am a longtime, Physical Security Systems Engineer with the government, and have lots of experience with CCTV cameras, motion control and other security devices, etc.\n \nCamera quality is decent, but nowhere as good as on company’s videos.  Also, it lacks Contrast Settings, which makes –depending on the current lighting conditions—identifying faces almost impossible.  However, Night Vision works well considering these limitations.  SkyBell’s website promises “Contrast Settings” are “Coming Soon”.\nWide Angle lens works as advertised.  You can see a wide area with the device attached to the door frame.\nNew Door Frame Adapter—came in the box-- is a welcomed addition to their offering and attaches well to the door frame.\nOn-Demand video activates reasonably well depending on your Wi-Fi speed and Cellular network, although you will need 4G LTE speeds to get acceptable results.\nRing Bell notification on App--I have iOS—was within a couple of seconds on local Wi-Fi and 15 seconds or more on Cellular connection.\nAudio is good from people talking at the door. However, audio to the person at the door is very choppy and rather poor.\nMotion Sensor is extremely poor and has only activated once, even when waving your hand in front of it.  On the flipside, it activated in the evening when my Landscape lights went on.\n\nInstallation, setup and syncing work as the instructions indicate. However, you'll need to read and follow them carefully.\n \nAll in All a reasonably good product. It provides the functions necessary to answer your doorbell from anywhere via your smartphone, tablet and see, speak and hear the person. However, I’m rating it only 3 stars until the Motion Sensor works and Contrast is added; and 5 stars when Server Recording is added.","updated":"2014-12-15T13:43:07-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=778872208&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1264599426","userName":"mikedodge04","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id41591939","version":"1.7.1","score":1,"title":"Does not work with iOS 9","text":"Does not work with iOS 9","updated":"2015-09-29T13:40:15-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=778872208&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1295362860","userName":"Poob Bubes","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id24383690","version":"1.7.4","score":1,"title":"Garbage","text":"Works 5% of the time.

At first it was working ok, then it went downhill after about 1.5 months.  I didn’t change anything. \n\n1.  The time it takes to answer the alert on the phone until I can actually see the video ranges from 5 sec to 15 seconds.  Most of the time if I can even see the video, its of the people walking away (at lease 6 feet from the camera)\n2. If the video works (which is right now 20% of the time), the video is not constant and freezes.  I can turn the video on from my phone and then walk outside and it doesn’t even update. I checked all the wireless settings.  2.4GHz, 20MHz, Ookla shows my speed at 50 Mbps constant connection.  I can FaceTime with family just fine without interruptions.  Even in the recorded video, it freezes and its streaky.  \n3. I went through Skybell support and checked EVERYTHING wth them. I even showed them my speed test screen shots and shared all the router settings.  They didn’t know what to do and blamed it on my spotty connection.  It’s only spotty on the Skybell.  For all my other devices it works fine.  I asked to be able to return it for a refund and they said to take it back to the place where I bought it.  Best Buy only has a 14 day return policy.  \n\nConclusion:  I’m left with a $200 door bell chime, not a video doorbell.  \n\nSTAY AWAY FROM SKYBELL!!!!!","updated":"2015-12-12T12:14:49-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=778872208&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1184252024","userName":"Doc#1","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id28911480","version":"1.7.1","score":2,"title":"Disappointed","text":"Have had Skybell 2.0 for 2 months and am very disappointed. The web site is very poorly set up and doesn't seem to have been updated in ages .There are virtually no instructions there or in the app as to how to use the app functions. No instructions as to what the switches mean. The picture they show of the app in this store does not match what is on my screen. They added activity recording with no explanation of how it should work. Mine records randomly, but not when some one is actually at the door. They mention server recording off handedly with no further explanation.  Another gripe is the motion detector. I had to turn it off since it would ring the bell as soon as someone passed by.The picture quality also is very poor. I guess I'm spoiled by my Dropcam.","updated":"2015-04-17T17:43:02-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=778872208&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1260531653","userName":"Myrickspc","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id6611100","version":"1.7.1","score":1,"title":"Fail","text":"Does not work period on my iPhone 6 or my wife's 6 plus but does work some times on my Nexus 9 tablet.

I opened the package as soon as it arrived only to find it had been opened before. It looked like a possible return that had been re-sold to me. All the tape tabs were cut. I then found that the special tool required to lock the bell to it's mounting plate was missing from the package. I wasn't too upset about this because I have a million different tools and thought I could still mount this thing. Turns out it is in fact their own tool that's needed. Still no problem....Then I decided to call customer service to request the special locking tool be sent to me. Not much fun, as they had me jumping through hoops just to get a phone number. Second, I was on hold for twenty minutes waiting for a rep.. Third, they wanted to email me a form to fill out that they would review and make a decision aa to whether i was eligible for a replacement part. WHAT! It's a tiny little \"L\" shaped locking tool that probably cost them a fraction of a cent. This was just too much, so I packaged it up and returned it to Best Buy who gladly gave me a ful refund. I'm going to wait now for another manufacturer to come out with one and hopefully have better customer service.","updated":"2015-03-13T14:18:01-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=778872208&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"931489857","userName":"Barracuda Bud","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id22645141","version":"1.0.1","score":2,"title":"Hit and miss","text":"After installation I could not get the device to sync with my wifi.

So I tried to create an account with my email and it said it was already being used by another user. So I created a new account and finally got it to sync after 5 tries. \n\nNow I've added my wife as a user but it still shows no devices in her app and it won't let me add it. Also, their website says you can look at the camera view anytime without someone ringing the doorbell but it doesn't say how and I can't find a way. \n\nAll in all it's a great proof of concept but that's about it so far. I'm looking forward to what will happen when all the bugs are worked out.","updated":"2014-01-26T11:06:44-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=778872208&type=Purple%20Software"}]
