An extra 3 days and still cannot get app to setup my 2nd plug. The main reason for this purchase was to use HomeKit and Siri. Sent email to iHome but no response. Will try calling today and hopefully be able to give a more positive review. Didn’t keep receipt from Walmart, may not be able to return. \n\nNow March 13—when I wrote the negative part of this review, I hadn’t yet called customer services. Before calling I had noticed an update for app. With great hope I updated with no change in my problems. Called for service, but was told technicians were out due to bad weather. Two days later got an email telling me about using the version of the app. I had already loaded. Tried many times to try getting the plug to work, including restoring and resetting my iPhone to a backup before I had purchased the plugs. One night I decided next day I would attempt a return at Walmart but that night before boxing them up—one last try. They hooked up and have worked with no problems. I love them now and would love more plugs. Just not sure I shouldn’t try the idevice this time. At the time of this update I give it 5 stars, because I don’t know for sure it wasn’t my WiFi signal.","updated":"2018-03-13T18:59:27-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=937056509&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"6613479903","userName":"Shadowboxheartwork","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id966272731","version":"2.4.2","score":2,"title":"Too many bugs.","text":"There seem to be quite a few problems with the app and I can't get my motion detectors online!

We then signed back into each device one-by-one before re-downloading the iHome iOS App, Factory Data Resetting each iHome Plug, and setting them up as new after verifying each device had the most up to date firmware. \n\nWe tested each Apple product with each outlet as we went, and then assigned each smart home accessory with a Static-IP address. \n\nAnd here we are, the next evening, and everything is still working perfectly! Let’s hope it stays this way, but if something changes, I’ll update this review again. \n\nAs of now, these products and their corresponding services are working perfectly!\n\n——————————\n\nFirst of all, I very rarely write reviews, and I don’t think I have ever left a 1-Star review before today. I will update this review when, or if, these issues are finally resolved. \n\nI am using an iPhone X 256GB (with over 100GB available) on iOS 11.4 (currently the newest iOS.)\n\nI bought four iHome plugs April ‘17 when I bought my first Alexa. Everything worked flawlessly with all four plugs with Alexa, Siri, the Apple Home app, and with the proprietary iHome iOS application. \n\nHowever, about a little over a month ago issues began. At first just Siri stopped working at times. Then the Apple Home application would report outlets as randomly “Not Responding”, then Alexa stopped working, and of the last week, I can’t even get the propriety iHome iOS application to turn the lights on or off at times. \n\nWhen the issues first began to occur, I attempt to resolve the issue myself. Being an Apple Education Representative for a cellular carrier, I am familiar with the product and the steps needed to troubleshoot  these issues traditionally. \n\nSO, I Factory Data Reset each plug, re-setup each plug up, re-installed the iOS application from scratch, re-installed the Alexa skill from scratch, and deleted all of my Apple Home data from my iCloud. Everything was back to brand-new..... or so I thought. \n\nAll of my hard work (about an hour and a half) allowed all of my products to work flawlessly (again) for about three hours. Then all the issues began again, until becoming unusable even within the propriety application. Two nights ago I couldn’t even turn off the lights in my bedroom or foyer to go to bed. \n\nSo yesterday, I went and bought new Hue bulbs, and decided to go ahead and repeat all of troubleshooting to the iHome plugs AGAIN, in hopes that I would be able to use the two separate forms of smart light control all within the Apple Home app. I spent about three hours setting it all up.\n\nEverything worked FLAWLESSLY.... for about an hour. Then the issues began again, but just with the iHome outlets. Each Hue product worked perfect, even the following day. I was so frustrated I immediately gathered all the iHome plugs and threw them into a box in my garage. \n\nHaving spent all this money on the products, and all my time setting up the products and troubleshooting the products, it is very frustrating not to be able to USE the products. \n\nAll I want is for the products to work. \n\nThe fact that I am able to see online reviews of many people reporting the same issues tells me that this is not defective equipment or user error. It tells me that iHome has got something messed up awful, and is not willing to admit it and quickly fix it. \n\nLet’s hope one day this will all be resolved.","updated":"2018-06-18T09:09:38-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=937056509&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"2529214774","userName":"headred","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id29467600","version":"2.2.6","score":1,"title":"Help","text":"Does not work that well having same problems as Steve","updated":"2018-05-10T11:26:36-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=937056509&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1958434864","userName":"NathanEatsSoup","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id215094364","version":"2.2","score":1,"title":"Lol","text":"My app doesn’t have the “add device” tab...... so I basically can’t use this $30 “smart plug” horrible app development","updated":"2017-11-29T15:52:15-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=937056509&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"7117854562","userName":"bobknetl","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id41984070","version":"2.4.2","score":1,"title":"Does not work with the latest publicly released 14.5 beta","text":"Can’t add outlet now to public release Beta 14.5","updated":"2021-03-18T13:20:54-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=937056509&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5006836923","userName":"TahieTess","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id16922562","version":"2.4.1","score":1,"title":"App Crashes","text":"The app crashes immediately on launch on IOS 13.","updated":"2019-10-24T06:47:50-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=937056509&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5003276815","userName":"RangeMaster0588","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id201631071","version":"2.4.1","score":1,"title":"Junk","text":"Won’t launch as of last iOS releAse","updated":"2019-10-23T13:46:33-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=937056509&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"2996674542","userName":"Axelaxelm","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id101639679","version":"2.2.7","score":1,"title":"Doesn’t follow schedule","text":"The scheduling does not work.

Yes, their app is horrid on my iPhone 6, (better on my iPad) but since deleting ALL rules in the app and instead using Homekit life with the devices is much better.  Now for Homekit details...\n\nIntegration of iHome with Homekit has let me again take control of my smart home.  Creating scenes such as morning and then automating them to run at certain times truly creates an easier carefree day, and here is just one example. \n\nI wake at 5:35am weekdays, I have a lighting scene automated to turn at 5:34am. I’m usually out the door by 7:50am but have setup the following rules and automation about leaving in case I leave early, etc.: Take note that due to DST and winter, sunrise and sunset really affect things by hours so rules can become complicated. When using ihome app I was always having to adjust times because the light of the day changes seasonal by several hours...\n\nNote that “RUN” means to run the automation\n\nRun Scene “AM Weekday ON” @ 5:34am, then...\n\n1) Run “AM weekday OFF” scene at 7:50am \n    (accounts me leaving home at normal time)\n2) Run “AM weekday OFF” scene at sunrise\n    (accounts for winter darkness & summer light) \n3) Run “AM weekday OFF” when I leave \n     (Homekit geofence setup)\n\nSo the latest I ever leave is 7:50am, the other two conditions take care of conserving power if it gets light earlier or I’m ahead of schedule for leaving. \n\nAs all of my home lighting is from solar power/batteries, conservation is always at the top.  I run other similar scenes and automations during the evenings, etc. \n\nI have many of iHome smart plugs using them for my lighting, Christmas tree, wax burners, plant light bulb, etc. and iHome had actually been nice enough to send me a complementary 5-in-1 SmartMonitor at no charge.  It’s sad to say that they should have done a bit more product development on it before going to market.  To even try to use the light sensor for day/night functions I had to point the light sensor outside (then anyone walking by my window could see the display data, not me lol) but found it was quite unreliable with activations, sensitivity and notifications,  I keep it in my garage now to monitor the temperature and when I’m working in there and let it control a smart plug for a salamander heater. \n\nSo to recap, the iHome devices are now a suggested BUY THEM, but forget about controlling them with the iHome app.  Other managment functions on devices themselves such as device renaming etc. can be done quickly with the free app “Elgato Eve”\n\nUPDATE: July 21, 2017\nOk these jerks just significantly limited their product.  They used to allow 10 rules for a device but they just changed it to 6.  If you have to change your wifi network when you do a reset the system will now only permit 6 rules.   You can't even set 1 per day now!\n\nFrom their tech support when I asked about it:\n\n\"Yes, you are correct! Our developer said there were too many issue allowing 10 rules per plugs so they lower the amount of rules.  \n\nThanks, \niHome Support \"\n\nAfter using their product over a year and them selling thousands of these devices across the country they just discover this? Yeah, right.   Smoke screen.  \n- - - - -\nDevice icons show up properly only in edit device.  When device listing appears (all devices on one page) it no longer displays.  I'm on iOS 10 iPhone 6. \n\nExample:  Audio icon changes to outlet plug when viewing devices, but the lamp icon displays properly.  \n\nAll in all the app has a nice interface and easy to understand but it would be great to be able to see all rules in a rule summary page instead of having to drill down to each device.","updated":"2017-12-10T06:29:40-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=937056509&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"6761012039","userName":"jsgkddhdhdhdid","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id823330781","version":"2.4.2","score":1,"title":"Not working right","text":"How to drag the the home sensor to a room or any room","updated":"2020-12-16T15:32:58-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=937056509&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"2370197438","userName":"Flyinghotdogcheese","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id145091247","version":"2.2.4","score":1,"title":"Smart plug not supported","text":"Updated my app and now it’s not showing a smart plug option ...?","updated":"2018-04-01T00:24:41-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=937056509&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5036388784","userName":"rwwhocares","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id181233129","version":"2.4.1","score":1,"title":"Immediate Crash","text":"Team.

Many of the the devices, although they look similar, are different so it’s not as if you can just check one to see if an update is available for all.\n\nSecond, this app used to show you when devices were unreachable. Now, it optimistically assumes they’re all ok until you toggle one on/off and then it finally admits that it didn’t even check. It seems iHome is hiding s much larger problem with their devices. They work great until they don’t. Every so often about half of mine will not be accessible. Some of these devices are within 10ft of the WiFi station. It seems as if they occasionally lock up and never reset and try to reconnect. Resetting the WiFi does nothing. The same devices that were connected before show up. You need to go around and manually unplug each of the ones that won’t connect. Then, they’re back and they work great! That is, until another few randomly won’t connect. It’s never the same ones. All mine have reserved IP addresses on my network. \n\nIf iHome thinks someone else is to blame, then post the technical details. All my other home automation devices do not have this kind of problem. \n\nThe app cannot easily change any network settings after initial set up. If you would like to, for instance change the name of the WiFi base station they connect to, you need to go through the entire set up process including scanning the HomeKit label. Furthermore, the app won’t even show the MAC address of any device. You need to unplug it and look at the tiny label.\n\nThe lack of thought and functionality put into this app shows how little concern they have. It’s been around long enough to expect some functionality in it. It seems it is just meant to give you a good initial experience and then nothing more. I’ll keep my devices as long as I can but I’m not buying any more of them.","updated":"2019-04-20T10:46:41-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=937056509&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"4999020005","userName":"Medicchop28","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id189256510","version":"2.4.1","score":1,"title":"App broken","text":"App won’t launch iPhone 11 latest iOS 13.1.3.

It has increased in its capability, and has not decreased my frustration. I tried updating the firmware, but it seemed the firmware update function failed. I decided to try setting up an account to see if this would enable the update, because updates are not able to be triggered from within the Homekit app, and thus is not redundant unlike all the other features of this app. Lo and behold, the password field does not allow pasting, and thus I am required to manually type in the long complex password I generated from 1Password. So already this is not going well; this decision to not allow pasting just decreased the security of the account. So as soon as I memorize and type in the long password and setup the account, I go back to the firmware update to find that it updated, maybe in the background. So I just decreased the security of my system by linking it to an iHome account for nothing. Perhaps some indication of a queued update in progress would have helped prevent this review update and the meretricious newly created account.\n\nOriginal review: Requires an account to do anything interesting. It is possible to provide useful and powerful capabilities without requiring one more account in a world of way too many accounts. It’s better just to control iHome devices through the default Apple HomeKit app.\n\nResponse to developer response: No, an iHome account is not required to get the device on the network and connected to Homekit.","updated":"2018-07-28T17:26:59-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=937056509&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"4999758964","userName":"Jkrysinhb","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id447090306","version":"2.4.1","score":1,"title":"Crash","text":"iOS 13.
