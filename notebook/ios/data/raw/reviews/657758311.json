I have nothing bad to say about their products *after* the setup process.\nTrying to setup these lights was not fun, especially when you’re setting up 15+ at the same time, and it honestly made me miss the fact that Phillips hue uses a hub on Ethernet instead of connecting each individual bulb to WiFi and HomeKit. After around 8 bulbs were setup the process became extremely unreliable as if the network was saturated despite the fact I had the lights on a separate access point with a special IoT WiFi network. \nThis might be my fault or my router but hey the app asked for a rating after hours of googling and resetting bulbs over and over because HomeKit is really good at having “unexpected errors occur”\n\nTL;DR these lights are great but be warned your experience may suffer with too many.","updated":"2021-11-10T15:56:50-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=657758311&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5841888911","userName":"Brosephpaul","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id211288874","version":"4.1.0","score":3,"title":"Good design, but often unresponsive.","text":"I know a lot of people don’t like the new UI, but it’s honestly a bit clearer, and looks much better. I only fumbled for a few days, accidentally turning my room mates lights on because of the new swiping features. Once you relearn though, it feels like it was well thought out. \n\nAs far as functionality, it’s a bit wonky. To transition to a scene I want, I have to tap back and forth between two different scenes, as if I have to wake up the lights from a rest mode. Also, I’m aware tiles have been discontinued, at least for now, but the app tends to not have total control over them anymore. I have 3 connected in a straight line. Unless I use a premade scene (and even then sometimes), they will randomly switch to morph. No matter what color I set them to (aside from “off”), they always end up on morph after about 3-5 minutes of whatever I had just set it to. \n\nSometimes while browsing colors in the color wheel, you’ll experience the whole wheel spin around incredibly quickly, as if it’s attempting to catch up. Something about this version communicates with the lights much slower than before.

What used to be a very straightforward operation in turning lights on or off has become twice as cumbersome with this revised app. The addition of fake line drawings of your different rooms is utterly pointless and only succeeds in filling up the screen so that you’re forced to scroll far too long if you have more than one room set up. The action of turning lights on or off is also much slower and unresponsive with the new app while adjusting individual lights in a group has become very difficult. \n\nThe new app has a greater emphasis on effects such as making all the lights in your house flicker like a candle or perform an epilepsy-inducing strobe. Pointless. Classic case of ‘can we do this’ instead of ‘should we do this’. \n\nThe app development team at LIFX should be ashamed at their lack of user testing.

It has some of the best lighting customizations without needed a 3rd party app. I’ve even grown to enjoy the new updates interface that everyone complains about. My big gripe with this app is the Apple Watch version. I usually want to use the watch for my light switches because it’s always on my wrist but it’s always super laggy and takes 5-10 seconds before I can turn the lights on and off with it, which defeats the convenience and speed of having your light controls on the watch. Once it loads up the switches sometimes don’t work or seem to get reversed so off becomes on. 3/5 stars might seem harsh for just the watch app issues but when I am spending $40 per bulb and up to $250 for some of their lights, I expect a perfected and responsive app. I would suggest LIFX adds a 2nd watch widget besides just a button to open the app. If they added a widget that just acted as a switch for a selected group of lights it would go a long way to make the watch experience better.","updated":"2021-05-13T20:23:13-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=657758311&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"7087524418","userName":"MustangBen08","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id319429314","version":"4.7.1","score":1,"title":"Won’t work with HomeKit and HomePod mini","text":"Aside from the bad interface of the app. I have 4 bulbs for a over year in my room and had the HomePod mini for couple months.

It comes with a great variety of colors and different settings and themes to go along with it. Love the pallets and overall really bright lights especially for bedrooms. Personally I don’t have a bedroom light or lamp and use the LIFX beams for lighting. The downside is the connectivity. On multiple occasions I had to reset my lights and repair them because the beams lost connection to my wifi, the set up process is very annoying. Unplugging the lights 5x to factory reset is a pain, especially if you have the plugin somewhere behind desk or furniture.

For precise projects, the lack of an undo/redo button on the Painting feature makes simple mistakes such a pain to fix. Also more scales of customization like hex colors in the painting feature, and dividing up the painting strip into a little grid that each represents like 2 leds instead of the strange blurred/blended strip that there currently is would be incredibly useful. \n\nJust some thoughts, but overall an alright app that I think is just limiting the potential of these great quality lights.","updated":"2021-11-01T00:55:16-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=657758311&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"6454477422","userName":"Matt Yocum","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id158075905","version":"4.4.2","score":3,"title":"Lights, amazing.

No questions there about whether I’d purchase again or continue to because I will.\n\nThe app on the other hand is barely useable. Here’s a short list of grievances:\n\n- Effects can’t be saved with scenes. This is crazy. Why can I not save the exact setup I want with effects included? I ALWAYS want a specific effect with my studio lights. How hard is this to implement?\n\n- Effects can’t be run without app being on. This is also aggravating for someone who is OCD about constantly quitting apps that aren’t in use by habit.\n\n- Much larger overall issue but the ergonomics hierarchy here is so so wrong. The menu layouts are terrible and it takes many steps to achieve some things that should only take a few clicks. Example: scenes should be stored with built in color palettes. Instead I have to adjust my light, go to another tab, select the scene, go into the scene, assign it, and then go back out. How about, select light, select scene..... done.\n\n- Google Nest integration is broken because of nest/google login issue\n\nThose are just to name a few... this app needs a total overhaul even though you guys put work into the new one.

You have to go back in and re-select Sunrise and then hit save again and it will save correctly.\n\nNow for my general review:\nOther than the bug I found, I really think this new app is a huge improvement over the previous version. It’s a lot easier to manage entire groups, set schedules, and the timeline view really helps see the order that everything is happening.  IDK why so many people are finding this version so difficult to work with. If you organize your lights into groups, changes to multiple lights are a lot easier.  Maybe if you only have a small number of lights it’s more cumbersome, but I’ve got 15 and on the old app it took me forever to get everything the way I wanted it.  \n\nBut that’s just me.

There are severe limitations. You cannot create a scene with effects in them. This really makes the bulbs pretty pointless. For example if you wanted to have your bulbs turn on at sunset and shift colors or flicker using the spooky effect. You would have to set the bulbs to turn on at sunset, selecting only one color and then each night go into the app and manually set the spooky or flicker theme or whatever effect. So pretty useless.
