I have the Orbi WiFi throughout my house and it will choose the best frequency per device....however some of my speakers only connect to 2.4g while the other ones are placed on 5g. Bose refused to address this issue. As expensive as their products are. They will not help. They expect me to buy all new speakers. Every speaker in my house and truck are Bose. So disappointed. They are way behind in technology.  I hope your speakers doesn’t become lost on THEIR network because THEIR speakers can’t remember where to connect, you will get to run through a long drawn out process which includes resetting WiFi and setting up the speaker all over again. I DO THIS 3 to 4 times a week. I’ve stopped expecting them to play when I want to hear music. Bose has dropped the ball. Think twice. Coming from a guy who pushed their product for sound quality for years, it’s sad to say that their app and “connectabily” are horrible!! They will not even play your Apple Music playlist so I hope you don’t subscribe because any music or playlist you’ve downloaded you won’t be hearing through THEIR speakers.\nBut if you enjoy spending a few hours a weekend on the phone with their technical team, this product is perfect for you!!!","updated":"2018-02-23T07:28:04-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=708379313&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1740318290","userName":"Macsngr","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id21088295","version":"15.120.23","score":5,"title":"Solved all of our problems!!","text":"Our problem were: trying to figure out a way to stream music in multiple rooms and have surround sound for the TV. We purchased a Bose Wave SoundTouch and a Bose SoundTouch 300. This got us exactly what we wanted and they communicate over our wireless network so setup was really easy and fast. Bose does not do a good job of making it clear that these two products can work together. It is clearly stated that the Bose Wave SoundTouch works in conjunction with the Bose SoundTouch 10, 20, and 30, but not clear about the SoundTouch 300 sound bar, bass and rear speakers. Even the very unhelpful store employees told us that these products would not work together. I did some research online while in the store and came to the conclusion that the employees were wrong. We took the chance and bought both and am glad we did. They work perfectly together. We can play music in one room, watch TV in the other, stream the same music in both rooms, or different music in both rooms. The system is very flexible like that. The app is easy to use and works great. Sound quality is what you would expect from a product bearing the Bose name.

We have the router separating 2.4ghz and 5ghz. We only use the 5ghz. A 5ghz signal, while much faster than 2.4 ghz, doesn’t travel as far as 2.4ghz. The system in our house needs the speed of 5ghz. While there is some fade at 1 outlying speaker, I love this system. It can be quirky. We’ve had this system for several years now. It has been frustrating (extremely) at times.

Lastly, the app does not let you stream podcasts, which is a sad limitation for this type of app. If you want to listen to a podcast, you have to download it on your notebook or PC (not your phone..), add it to an iTunes playlist, and stream it from your iTunes library (which by the way, won't refresh while the app is running).

Sonos boasts integrated Alexa functionality but we aren’t big Google/Amazon ecosystem users at home. Even so, I imagine that integrated feature can be very convenient.\n\nCoupled with Bluetooth, the Wi-Fi capability was a big selling point. At the price of these and similar speakers, I imagine a lot of folks are looking at audio fidelity. I was pretty surprised at the augmented quality playing audio through Wi-Fi versus Bluetooth. Having both connectivity options will definitely come in handy.\n\n Very happy with this purchase. I opted for two speakers so the stereo field is a truly pleasant listening experience.\n\nLast, I am a huge fan of the tactile buttons as another control option. While I’ll probably do most of the controlling via phone/app, I can appreciate the availability and superior quality of the buttons on the speakers. \n\nThank you, Bose!","updated":"2017-11-17T12:31:47-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=708379313&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5133219121","userName":"Steelhdr","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id37511421","version":"23.0.4","score":5,"title":"Amazing sound and ease of use!!","text":"I purchased the Bose SoundTouch 30 to replace the old surround sound system I had in my office.

I love it we loved it, except one downside, they got rid of SoundTouch control vice improving the piece, utilizing your phone directly with the speakers won’t work well like the control. Smart phones will disconnect itself from speakers for longer time of listening because phones MUST sleep to save power even the smart phone is plug in directly to AC charger. I hope something will get done with the app or make a new innovated BOSE sound touch control.","updated":"2019-05-24T16:38:34-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=708379313&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5210370610","userName":"flashgordon59","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id953870353","version":"23.0.4","score":5,"title":"SiriusXM","text":"This Bose sound touch IV is the bomb.

Wow what awesome sound from such a small speaker - with base!  The SoundTouch app brings the whole Bose system together.  Not only can you setup all of your pay music services in one app, but this app can control multiple SoundTouch devices at once.  This is a very easy way to setup a whole house sound system.","updated":"2017-12-17T09:14:03-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=708379313&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"2196303904","userName":"aabston66","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id26774711","version":"17.170.82","score":1,"title":"Speakers never stay connected","text":"I have 2 Bose SoundTouch 20 and a SoundTouch portable and they never stay connected to each other.

And the volume buttons on my phone only control one speaker not the entire group so to adjust volume I have to go into the app and drag the slider. Also the volume buttons on my phone only control one speaker rather than the entire group, forcing me to use the slider volume control in the app itself. Very inconvenient. I would not recommend this, there are better systems available especially for the premium price of Bose.","updated":"2019-09-19T20:21:27-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=708379313&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"2250014021","userName":"salyk","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id199838543","version":"18.1.4","score":5,"title":"Love it when...","text":"When it works correctly!
