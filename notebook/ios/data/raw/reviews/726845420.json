It’s only just started doing this in the last month or so, which makes me think it’s just an update issue (and I’ve had it for like 2 yrs). BUT! Ultimately worth the buy!  \nUpdate-July 2018- we’ve had another iBabyCare update, still needing to plug my phone into the camera base multiple times a week.

The camera seems just fine, but the app has always been the pain point. It routinely gets killed by the iOS watchdog for freezing. It is sometimes hard to tell whether our child hasn’t moved in a while or if the app has frozen—until that 15-second window closes and the app gets killed by the OS. This simply is not good enough for quick checks on a child.\n\nThe UX itself has received no obvious improvements in the time we have used it. The presentation of the air quality data reported by the camera is a source of serious annoyance and disappointment. The graph is baffling to the point that it is meaningless to me. If anything, this app makes me regret spending extra to get the camera model with the extra sensors. I guess the marketing department at iBaby Labs is skilled at glossing over the shortcomings of the software—you know, the part of the product that is ostensibly flexible and open to continuous improvement.\n\nIt saddens me that the software component of this otherwise solid product has been left to languish. Frankly, I was shocked that the company updated the app for the iPhone X (released November 2017). In my memory, that is the only real change that has been made, and that was simply to keep the app from being letterboxed in compatibility mode.","updated":"2019-10-20T07:12:49-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=726845420&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5227114885","userName":"Xrhdhiintr1234dyttt","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id464412857","version":"2.4.2","score":1,"title":"Complete WASTE of money","text":"Let me start out by saying I only gave it 1 star because I don’t have the option to leave 0.

The reviews I had read were wrong and we truly loved this monitor, then September 2019 rolls around and everything changes. The app starts crashing, when it did work it took forever for the app to send directions to the camera, and if I would try to play music it would crash instantly, and for my daughter that was a huge deal because she had gone the past 6 months listening to the music from her monitor to sleep. It is now December of 2019, I have yet to hear from customer service and I have gone 4 months without a monitor because we can’t afford to get one. The app glitches, even with being reconnected 5 minutes prior (reconnecting it is the same as the initial set up so you have to be right by the monitor to do so, not ideal when you have a sleeping child that you’re trying to not wake up), then even when I finally get the monitor to work it never last longer than a hour. \n\nIbaby could be a great thing, but they don’t care about its customers, or fixing the problems with their app. 10 out of 10 DONT recommend.","updated":"2019-12-02T19:55:12-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=726845420&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"3826800779","userName":"Kjean16","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id30592938","version":"2.3.5","score":2,"title":"Don’t waste your money","text":"I have had nothing but problems with this monitor.

The short list of complaints:\n\n* the only device on our mesh wifi network that has constant connectivity issues. We have 5 other full HD cameras; all of them work fine. \n\n* the iPhone app is the worst battery hog ever.  Even with the screen turned off, only using the app for audio monitoring - I  have never seen any app drain a fully charged phone so quickly. \n\n* the mini usb power connector is not aligned properly. One cannot simply has connect the power cord. It must be inserted at a very awkward angle or the plug just does not go in. \n\n* the environmental monitors are not accurate. Especially the thermal metrics which I checked against other controls.   I’m not sure about humidity or c02 but I suspect that they may be inaccurate too. \n\n* today was the last straw. The M7 suddenly won’t play any music or sound effects. Resetting the app on two different iPhones, nor a full hardware reset did any good.  In fact, now we are without any baby monitor because the factory reset seems to have hosed the device. Despite following all instructions and trying at least 10 times, the setup hangs between steps 1&2. \n\nI have never posted a review but I am so aggravated with this over priced garbage that I felt the need to warn others.","updated":"2020-03-14T15:23:39-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=726845420&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5881680504","userName":"mgchan","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id85155024","version":"2.4.4","score":3,"title":"Works OK, but kills battery","text":"I have two monitors and this works pretty well.

It’s nice to be able to have the audio in the background but there’s no real reason to have so much background activity.

They clearly are not interested in keeping up.\n\nSo what needs to be done?   First, the app only supports running in portrait mode.  You can tilt, and the video switches, but the app itself is still in portrait mode.  This isn’t as much an issue on the iPhone as it is the iPad.   The iPad is mainly used in Landscape mode and you can’t use other apps with it.  It does NOT support split screen, PIP video (when minimized) and other features of the iPad.  Coming from an iOS developer, these are easy to implement.  It just appears that the company has no interest in customer retention or growth.  \n\nAgain, I recommend looking at other baby monitors that have adapted.

This is something that I feel should not have happened from installing one of their updates. But for now I am back up and running. Hopefully this problem will not rear its ugly head again. \n\nOriginal review:\nI installed the firmware update when the popup appeared within the app. I am now unable to view the video feed on any device. A reset and reconnect also failed to restore the video. I then deleted and re-installed the app. After this I was still unable to view the video feed. I now have a worthless piece of hardware. The manufacturer better fix this quick as we rely on the baby monitor to monitor the sleeping child while dealing with the one who is awake. Extremely disappointed with what happened today and I will be forced to seek remedy soon if this is not quickly corrected.","updated":"2016-01-20T11:54:21-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=726845420&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5480637189","userName":"Zyauch","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id283988210","version":"2.4.3","score":1,"title":"Battery drain","text":"App stays awake in the background and drains the battery of the phone.","updated":"2020-02-02T15:55:23-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=726845420&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5928141134","userName":"MikeyCake","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id181981887","version":"2.4.4","score":1,"title":"FIX THE APP!","text":"Disconnects randomly, image freezes, doesn't connect!","updated":"2020-05-10T08:49:18-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=726845420&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"2920152780","userName":"jfreem32","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id863015926","version":"2.3.1","score":2,"title":"Bad audio","text":"The audio doesn’t work.

This isn’t a very complicated process, and it is a very important need for parents. These cameras are meant, first and foremost, to serve as a monitoring tool for a parent to watch over a small child. Simply put, any parent who relies on iBaby is compromising the ability to monitor the child’s safety and well-being. I am done with iBaby! A new glitch in the camera now causes the audio feed to turn off completely while the audio connection/icon remains highlighted. So, within minutes of turning on the camera and audio connection, the audio feed cuts out completely while the app gives absolutely no indication that something isn’t working. I have had the same camera for over a year, and for the most part everything has worked as expected in that first year. But these last few months have seen nothing but unreliable problems. I do not want to put my child in a position where we cannot hear him for hours and hours at a time. What if he is sick, what if he has a nightmare, what if climbs out of the crib!? There are a number of things that a parent simply NEEDS to know are happening ... and iBaby is not the type of partner that values those needs. Good bye. \n\nUPDATE-All of my previous issues have been addressed and corrected. Thank you for listening to your customer feedback.\n\nWhile I'm sure everyone has their own features that are most important to them, here are the biggest issues I have with recent iBabyCare updates:\n\n(1)  There is a significant delay in loading the app. Before it was much faster, and if you already had it running and just were switching back on iOS there was hardly any delay. After the recent updates, there seems to be some substantial reloading or relogging in process. \n\n(2)  There quality control process for the programmers of this app now seems to be LIVE updates with trial & error. This app is very important and personal to a lot of parents. We do not want to hope that the app is working. We do not want to wait until big fixes are pushed out before making sure that our children are alright. \n\nI used to speak very highly of this app, and regularly recommended it to family and friends. That is absolutely no longer the case. I would feel completely embarrassed to pass along the iBabyCare name only to have a new parent come back to me questioning what I suggested to rely on for monitoring their baby. \n\nNo thanks!!!\n\n-- A very disappointed parent.","updated":"2017-12-12T06:00:07-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=726845420&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"3361007243","userName":"Eduacnp","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id175692286","version":"2.3.2","score":5,"title":"Perfeito","text":"Funciona perfeitamente.

So far no issues, easy install , and has everything I needed in a baby monitor! Love the ability to see/ hear remotely (was really important feature I needed). Further amazing that you can invite people to see the same images you see live. Amazing ! 5 stars thus far! However the decrease in stars is that you don't have that much control to the access of individuals you invite. Great for grandparents to have access ... however they can hear and see live images at all times once you invite . There is no option to turn off/ on access temporarily. I doubt anyone wants baby's grandparents hearing/ seeing ANYTIME they want... as owner/ parent of baby you would want more control (example turn of hearing access). Further you can delete user but they still can see / hear everything (you might think, \"ok I deleted I can say anything / do anything ... NOOOO!!!) . If they don't close the app, they may NEVER close it, then they STILL have access to everything. They must close app after you've deleted them in order for them not to have access anymore .

That said, it is terrible with app switching (freezes and crashes), it has no mechanism for letting you know that the “video” of your sleeping child is actually a still frame and 15 minutes old because the feed is down, and if you want to use bluetooth headphones at all while the app is open you can forget it. Another baby cam I have has a crappy app, but at least allows me to listen to my phone with bluetooth headphones while monitoring my kid. It would also be nice to have an auto-mute feature that allows you to not have to hear the white noise of your kids empty room constantly throughout nap time or the whole night. The biggest issue is, however, that you can sometimes go a while with no indication that the app and or video feed froze.  The other day the app was frozen for nearly 15 minutes on a still image of what appeared to be a sleeping baby. If she hadn’t been in a rocker that I could tell wasn’t moving it would have been easy to think that everything was still fine even if it wasn’t. I don’t expect this type of tech to be flawless, but I should be notified when a problem is occurring so that it can be addressed, or I can at least choose to ignore it.","updated":"2016-01-31T15:39:48-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=726845420&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1485573354","userName":"SBurt123","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id295037387","version":"1.2.4","score":5,"title":"Best Camera Option Out There!!","text":"We love ibaby!

Like all software, there are a few issues we ran into: We love having both a night vision option or regular camera setting. It will automatically switch between the two based on the light in the room. We ended up defaulting to night vision all the time because it would occasionally \"click\" back and forth between the two in the middle of the day and make a noise. Also, one of the updated releases there was a audio \"bug\" where it would cut in and out on sound. I called the customer service line and they immediately explained the issue, let me know when it would be fixed and in the meantime provided me a new link to download a temporary app where the audio didn't cut in and out.

App is easy to use. Setup wasn't quite as easy due to my wifi setup and the extra security I have set up. The upside was one call to the company and it was resolved. \n2. Very nice that while at home on the same network, you can exit the app and still listen in for any sound or movement. I feared it would not allow me to go to other apps and use my phone as necessary and still be able to listen in.\n3. Camera function with pan works well along with night time quality more than sufficient. My only complaint if you can call it that with the auto function of night vision is that it seems to take a lot of light to shut it off. The camera tends to stay on night viewing most of the time. \n4. Doesn't seem to drain my battery like I thought it would. \n\nSome things to work on\n1. When I have the app open and listening, it tends to lose audio when after I take a call. I have to quit the app and restart to get audio. This is very annoying\n\nHow to make the overall product better?\n1. iPad app\n2. Mac OS X app so when I'm at my desk I can always have it up.

Temperature and humidity work only once in a while, sometimes sound just wouldn't work at all, or sometimes app just wouldn't connect for 4-5 days, costumer service takes time to up to a week to respond you instead of promised 24 hours and does not help you to solve the issue. Yes our monitor located close to the router and we have great wifi and latest updates, the iBabyCare system is just unreliable you will never know when app will crash in a middle of the night, oh and plus it's drains your phone battery!

If you choose to deny push notifications it asks you every, single, time you open the app. Every time. It's really frikking annoying. Hey ibaby, I DON'T WANT PUSH NOTIFICATIONS! So if you don't want this annoying pop up you have to agree to push notifications. It brings up the next pop up telling you to go to settings and enable push notifications. I have tried every combination of going through these pop ups to disable them. I have also uninstalled and reinstalled the app more times than I can count. Even reinstalled the app after a fresh iPhone restore. The only way to stop the pop ups is to agree to push notifications, enable push notifications, and then disable all of the banners, badges, sounds etc. If I say I don't want push notifications, it's because I don't need them.

Lights on the monitor can be distracting to baby esp in a blacked out room. Monitor also a little noisey when panning. But overall works great if these issues don't upset your baby. We're using the iBaby app on our iPhone 6+'s with an M6 Monitor purchased in Feb 2015.  Setup is a breeze although the app would often freeze when both phones we're being used (easy fix: both users should use the same iBaby account rather than each user's individual acct). We added a 2nd monitor a few months later but this also caused random freeze ups.  A quick call to iBaby's customer service dept, along with a subsequent email from them with step by step instructions on how to reset the monitor, and both of our apps & monitors have been working great ever since.

The app has portion of notification and alert tone (alarm) when it detects motion/sound. The notification works fine all the time. However, the alert tone only plays sometimes. I have ensured that the phone is not in silent mode and volume/ringers are at increased level. With the lack of a separate device for viewing/ controlling the baby monitor (like many other brands provide), I feel this is a huge flaw in the software or the device. The whole purpose of the monitor is to get alert when baby is moving or crying and iBaby monitor/ software isn't doing that consistently!\nThere are other secondary issues in the app too. Sometimes the settings just keeps on loading and I have have to restart the app to get it working again.\n\nI am surprised how people could design such poor product or app when it comes to baby safety. I recommend everyone to stay out of this product. I just opened ticket with the support team but I am honestly thinking of returning this product after reading other reviews that have issues like mine.","updated":"2017-04-02T08:03:13-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=726845420&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1245439953","userName":"Lvgfit","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id120869525","version":"1.1.0","score":4,"title":"It's great!","text":"I have used 2 other different kinds of baby wifi cameras in the 8 years I have been a mom and this one does the best job of all.

I love the features (being able to listen, speak, record, take pictures, view remotely, play music, have multiple ppl \"in control\" if desired, all from your phone, etc). Installation was super easy. As with most baby monitors, it was hard to find a spot that can view the entire crib. We ended up taking down one side of the crib bumpers for that reason. I don't like that it makes a camera shutter sound every time it switches from daytime vision to night vision. It kills your battery (as expected though for what it does). You definitely have to have your phone charging if using for a prolonged time. Our picture quality is excellent. We bought a second one for the family room.

It's worsened after each firmware update as the app loses connection every six minutes or so, and now (Feb. 2017) it seems as though shifting the app to the background makes it cut the feed entirely.  Reopening causes a refresh. \n\nI spoke with iBaby support and was promised that fixes were in the works - as of November 2015.  It's been over a year and the problems have only worsened, and support still says variations on 'in the works.'

We can check the monitor from both our phones whenever and wherever we have our phone with us. I can check from work, or even in the car on my way home to see if I should tell my wife to put the dog in the garage before I pull up do he doesn't wake the baby.
