The app itself attempts to walk the user through it, but some steps aren’t clear—like how to get the white SLOW pulse. I still have no idea for what the other faster pulses are used.\n\nThis app is complex, with its numerous options available to the user, but I enjoy having the freedom to connect my DT speakers the way I want and listen to my libraries and playlists how I want. And, when there is a technical difficulty (like a disconnect), there are options to troubleshoot the problem and reconnect. Again, the complexity of this app seems purposeful and allows the user the freedom to choose from more options than the ordinary app. I am able to walk through my house and hear my music in various rooms without running wires in the attic or crawl space. Using the WiFi in my house as it’s network works very well and is satisfying. Overall, I’m enjoying this app very much.","updated":"2019-12-30T12:14:55-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=917222891&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"7202570550","userName":"sooz-3-Q","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id18690333","version":"5.11.190918","score":5,"title":"The Best Music App","text":"This is an AWESOME way to be connected to your favorite music!

For the last two years, every time I would try to use the app, it would constantly be “reconnecting” ...only working for a minute or two before reconnecting once again. I actually stopped using the app altogether, turning the functionality of my houseful of speakers, nearly useless (unless I plugged a phone directly onto one of them via mini audio jack). I upgraded my WiFi system to Orbi last month and have been successfully using the Def Tech app ever since! I’m so happy to hear music streaming through my entire house on the same note once again! \nHaving said that, the system does have to “reconnect” every once in a while and I’m not sure why.\nAlso, I regularly need to log back into my SiriusXM account when I start up the app, which is a little frustrating. \nOnce suggestion for improvement I have for the app is that it would be great to control the volume for each speaker via a numerical system, say 1 - 40. Where you could turn the kitchen speaker up one tick and the soundbar down two ticks. Currently, the speakers each use a slide bar to change the volume they don’t have fine attenuation control (i.e., you may move one right a millimeter and nothing happens, then right another millimeter and volume jumps up 20 decibels.)\nAll of my speakers would greatly benefit from finer volume attenuation control (especially in the very low volumes) and replacing the slide bar with a numeric control would also be greatly appreciated.\nAlso, I agree with the requests to add Apple Music as a music service. That is a requirement in this day and age.","updated":"2020-06-22T15:02:05-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=917222891&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"6720479391","userName":"Bbottini","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id85337737","version":"5.11.190918","score":1,"title":"Fix your app!!","text":"SiriusXM doesn't work.

Only plug in 1 speaker at a time with the sound bar and setup that speaker. Then install 1 speaker at a time.  If you want surround sound (which I use with the sound bar and 2 W7’s, setup that last.  And when you have a new version software, be prepared for the update to mess up the setup.

Let me reiterate:  my wifi is excellent and I have no problems connecting independently to them SiriusXM app.  But to do so via this mechanism is horrible.  Half the time it cycles forever “reconnecting”.  When it does, half the time I cannot load a station and instead am told “difficulty downloading genres”.  When I finally do get to a station, I can listen for anywhere from 5 to 120 minutes before it decides to disconnect itself.  The only reason I bother with this app is to listen to music using the sound bar without tuning in to the TV.  Will someone at Definitive ever take this issue seriously?  Or is this app so secondary to their business model that they don’t really care??\n\nI have been struggling with the app for this sound bar for quite some time.  I like the idea of streaming directly to the sound bar and avoid tuning on the TV.  But, if only the darn thing would work reliably.\n\nI will start-up SiriusXM, for which I have a subscription.  Half the time I can’t select a channel; instead I get an error message that says “cannot download genre”.  When I do get in, I can start streaming fine.  But after anywhere between 5 minutes and 2 hours the thing quits streaming; it tells me it is “trying to connect”.  I will manually connect and it will stream again for a few minutes then quit.  Sometimes if I force-close the app and re-open it, it will work again for a while; sometimes it does not.\n\nThe Definitive tech support staff are less than helpful.  They blame my internet connection (I have no trouble streaming 4K video from Netflix or YouTube or Amazon).  Or they will blame SiriusXM, even though I can listen uninterrupted on the iPad or laptop.  So the problem is with the Definitive app and they appear unwilling and unable to address the problem.\n\nNice concept; poorly executed.","updated":"2021-02-21T15:13:43-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=917222891&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5972564322","userName":"Dr.d man","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id101502915","version":"5.11.190918","score":1,"title":"YouTube","text":"Add YouTube music please!","updated":"2020-05-20T18:50:28-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=917222891&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5522473781","userName":"Carbide Frank","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id204414665","version":"5.11.190918","score":4,"title":"Struggling","text":"Sometimes,especially in the beginning, I struggled with using the Definitive App. I found a YouTube video that was helpful,but, it was mediocre.

The app and speaker are relatively easy to pair, in theory, but I generally have to repeat the pairing steps 3-5 times before I can actually get the two to pair. Once paired, you’d think one could stream music regardless of the music app, right? Wrong. You are limited to a handful of apps and the most recent “advancement” (early 2018) is the capability to stream music from Amazon Music. How many people with iPhones use Apple Music? I’m sure it’s quite a bit..how would Definitive have an app available through Apple store and not support Apple Music?","updated":"2018-08-15T20:06:51-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=917222891&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1602751547","userName":"Scotty Specks","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id302230726","version":"3.81.170421","score":1,"title":"Doesn't Make Sense...","text":"The app is not intuitive at all, and impossible to play from the iTunes library when connected.

Important is that I live in Germany and therefore use Amazon Music (Germany, Amazon.de). The connection of the sound bar to the app worked without problem, but when trying to stream from either Amazon Music or Spotify it didn’t work because it wasn’t available for my region. I am really disappointed and hope that this issue will be addressed in future updates. I see potential with this app and sound bar which is one of the reasons I bought it. Unfortunately I can’t really recommend this app to any one in Germany, but I hope this changes in the near future.","updated":"2016-03-05T01:27:12-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=917222891&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1319878966","userName":"MTRVW","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id272651777","version":"3.1.7564","score":2,"title":"No Amazon Music","text":"Need to support streaming from Amazon music","updated":"2016-01-21T04:01:34-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=917222891&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1189879252","userName":"Bo Jackson Jr","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id3530098","version":"2.5.5118","score":5,"title":"Spotify","text":"Ecstatic with the addition of Spotify, can’t wait for Spotify multi zone… keep updating guys!

However, this is a a very bad app compared to sonos and the lack of spotify and no os x application have me seriously considering returning the system and going with the sonos options.  I would love to ditch my current Sonos speakers and get more Definitive speakers, but the software just isn’t on the same level in terms of usability, reliability, features and content.","updated":"2015-03-22T08:39:35-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=917222891&type=Purple%20Software"}]
