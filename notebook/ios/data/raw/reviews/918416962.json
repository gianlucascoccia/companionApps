I give 3 stars because the camera works well. But the app keeps shutting down & the volume for others to here don't work well for the two way which is weird because initial set up volume is loud.

When I did contact them before hand about setting up the camera they replied quick but then stopped. Setting up camera is not easy. It's a bit frustrating.
