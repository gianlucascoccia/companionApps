Yes it will turn off when it stops receiving Bluetooth signal, but it doesn't turn back on until you run the app. \n\nSo you have to get your phone out and run the app, even if you already had it running you have to refresh it. \n\niPhone also shuts down Bluetooth when the screen is locked, so your lights will turn off automatically unless you disable the auto-lock which is ridiculous. If you aren't going to lock your screen, you're not going to put your phone in your pocket or bag. And you don't want to have to go into the settings and change the auto lock every time you leave and return. \n\nIn short, poor design. At $30-40 per bulb it's a waste of money.

Now useless without it. Since I've seen a 4-pack of bulbs sell for as little as $11.00 at microcenter I suspect the company is in financial trouble and we are all SOL.","updated":"2015-10-15T15:57:55-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=597789993&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1311073723","userName":"Romanlion","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id28088108","version":"1.4.1","score":2,"title":"Please update to work with iOS 9 - App crashes on startup now!!","text":"Update 01/03/16:\n\nI received a response from the company support team on October 15th stating that they were aware of the cause and that it would be approx 2 weeks before the update made it thru the App Store process, etc...Surprise - 3.5 months later and still no app update or communication...DONT bother purchasing their bulbs or if you have, return them ASAP and purchase a more reliable brand from a company the actually cares about its customers and supporting its products reliably.\n\n--------\n\nOriginal review - October 2015:\nNumerous users have already reported this but there appears to be no response from You, the developer. Your app has always been behind in development terms, but this is the worst because the app crashes immediately when starting which makes it completely unusable and makes it impossible to access our bulbs or their settings...Please update ASAP, and while you are at it, please update the functionality - i.e. Integration with Ring doorbells, lockitron bolt, nest thermostats, Apple home kit, etc, etc...it would be great if your app kept up with the latest trends in home automation etc.","updated":"2016-01-04T02:29:24-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=597789993&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1274669617","userName":"rubapubpub","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id134512724","version":"1.4.1","score":2,"title":"IOS 9 killed it!
