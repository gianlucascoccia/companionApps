However, there are a few annoying bugs and UI elements that can be improved. \n\nIn terms of bugs, the most glaring one that I've seen is that if you've changed your account password on the web admin page, the app would stop working and complain that the password was wrong. However, there is no way that I could see to change the password that the app uses to log in. To resolve this, I had to delete and re-add the device. From there, I noticed that if you don't put in the device ID, the validation logic for that field says that you've entered in a device ID that was over twenty characters long. \n\nAs for UI improvements, there are numerous (but then again, I'm a UX snob). For one, why do I need to go look up my device ID when I'm trying to log into my account? It should just be recorded as part of it. Next, with respect to opening and closing doors, there's this kludgey element where you swipe left/right and up/down to activate the action.

Why not just have a list of gates/doors and an open button. Next to each. No need for each one to take up the whole screen. And why swipe up and down? Just make it a friggin button!\n\nFinally why do you need a random code to set this up? Can‚Äôt it just be set up with a username/password and then that‚Äôs all you need? Just makes this whole thing seem second rate.","updated":"2019-03-30T11:18:27-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=964757967&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"3911483825","userName":"Med dement","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id112933756","version":"2.4","score":1,"title":"Nope not this one","text":"Lots of choices on control of garage doors out there.
