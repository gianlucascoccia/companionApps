Will just say, “Alexa, ask Rachio to run zone 3 for 15 minutes.”  Also, I like that I can VERY simply select certain of the zones to run manually (quick run).  Literally can have that started in 10-15 seconds of zone selection time.  You can also allow professionals (your landscaper or sprinkler repair company) to access it.  This allows them to work on your sprinklers  without you having to give them your phone.  I gave this a 5 because it’s not a 4, but I think it is really a 4.5.  So far I can’t fully trust the automatic weather feature.  I am all about using water only when needed, but in our climate, if you give too little everything will die.  I noticed that it won’t run the sprinklers when the slightest bit of rain has recently occurred.  That slight bit of rain would never have been enough to get to the roots of the plants / grass.  The good news it is a easy to use that I turned off the auto weather feature, and I just manually disable the Rachio if enough rain has occurred or is obviously going to occur.","updated":"2021-03-07T10:36:52-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=864325098&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"4497391274","userName":"BigZepFan","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id38573565","version":"3.15.1","score":5,"title":"3rd clock in 10 years","text":"This is the third auto sprinkler clock I have tried in the past 10 years because of incredibly disappointing results and other reasons.

One zone we can’t get to run, we have had a sprinkler company come out and verify, it’s getting power and water and it’s set up and programmed right, and was working on our previous system just before switched over.

I would totally give it 5 stars if it had a RJ45 jack on the back to possibly run it PoE (power over ethernet) over a CAT 6. This would give it rock solid connectivity and may resolve a lot of people’s issues. Sometimes when I pull my truck in the garage a certain way it will reduce the signal to 60% (metal barrier). With a hard wired connection none of these changes in everyday life would effect the connectivity and cause people to post un researched problems and immediately blame the device. Oh, and on a previous post on how the Rachio got his WiFi password. This is a HomeKit device, that’s why you bought it right? You said you had a iPhone so you are prob a iOS and AppleTV guy.

Also on the saturation skip it would be nice to have a choice to reduce water verses skipping all together.  I live in a very dry place and the ground doesn’t stay saturated for long.

Nothing works to get the app to respond except to delete the app and load it anew from the App Store, which gets old very quickly. Additionally, its ability to postpone scheduled waterings based on upcoming weather forecasts of rain is too dependent (100%) on a weather service, which historically is nowhere near that perfect; while it is relatively easy to override such a “rain skip” of a scheduled watering by clicking on a “run” button, that has become the antithesis of automated watering for me in five months of usage in the DFW Metroplex.

It automatically tracked sunrise times & adjusted according.\n\nRachio unfortunately is missing this particular function, so i have to re-adjust every weekend to following the shorter daylight :(\n\nThe Blossom setup was very intuitive where as the Rachio was a little more involved and i had to re-do it twice before it each zone was accurately location labeled.

If you need to adjust something, there are so many terms that don’t mean anything to someone who just wants to make it water more or less often.  Also, the nearest weather station that the software uses to decide when next to water is in a completely different micro climate from us so the watering schedule often isn’t appropriate.
