You can play what's on your iPhone, and you can use your spotify account. That is all. The Bluetooth connection is so weak that the iPhone must be in the same room with the speaker. \nIf you have any questions or need help, don't waste your time with customer support,  you will not be acknowledged in any way. \nWe bought these because they seemed, from the makers' representation, a decent and less expensive substitute for our Sonos system, which we love and which performs excellently but is more pricey. After dealing with these, we will gladly be buying Sonos and never look at these again.\n\nThere are lots of Bluetooth speakers out there. The reason I am dissatisfied is that I bought what purported to be a wifi speaker and it only performs as a Bluetooth speaker. I realize that operator error is a common cause for this type of complaint but I am decently tech savvy and this is the only wifi device in my home that fails to function adequately. \n\nIf anything changes and these begin to do what they are marketed to do or if I discover what I am doing wrong, I will update this review with apologies to the makers.
