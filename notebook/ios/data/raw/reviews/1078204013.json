I own 4 P2 outlets and about a week ago they stopped working with Alexa. Despite several calls to Amazon (who at least tried to help), Koogeek customer support is non-existent. They send emails saying sorry for the inconvenience, but offer useless assistance. Despite telling them, all procedures have been followed, including disconnecting and reconnecting hardware and apps, still nothing! Interestingly, it works flawlessly with Siri, but nothing with Alexa. I explained that it worked previously, but it was like talking to a wall. They just don’t get it!  Numerous folks are encountering the same issue, so in an effort to save those who are considering buying this product, GO ELSEWHERE!  I resorted to buying the Belkin WEMO mini to see if worked with Alexa...yes it did, no problems. I’m hoping this stinging review will convey a message to Koogeek... get your act together with Amazon if you expect people to buy your product!","updated":"2018-07-06T16:18:33-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1078204013&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1942481442","userName":"Daveychan","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id43900923","version":"2.3.3","score":1,"title":"Just Horrible","text":"Everything you've read is true.
