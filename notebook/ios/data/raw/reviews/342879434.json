Simple, intuitive to use. Good descriptions on the coffee capsule choices. Easy to make and change selections, pay and be done. One downside though, was that the app awarded me 3 free sleeves of decaf intenso capsules at the bottom of my shopping basket (great!) while at the same time giving me a pop-up warning that decaf intenso is sold out (not great). It gave me no option to choose another type of capsule for the freebie (which I assume is a benefit of having bought as many sleeves as I did).  Freebie failure.  It left me feeling, somewhat irrationally, like I lost something as a result of my purchase. This is probably not a great way for an app to leave a customer feeling.  This seems like a fixable glitch in the app, adding the ability to catch when you're sold out of your freebie item and offer alternatives. \nOverall, though, I'll definitely use the app again when I don't have time to go to a Nespresso boutique.  Oh - one more suggestion: at checkout, include the option for users to request a capsule recycling mail-in bag.

One, I work at a five star-five diamond urban hotel and have access to fantastic traditionally made espresso on a daily basis. Two, Nespresso coffee is as good if not better than this espresso. Also, the milk frothing device that came with our Vertuo bundle is amazingly consistent at providing fantastic foamed milk. I know the amount of technique and patience it takes for an individual to master using a steam wand and IT IS NOT AN EASY technique to perform. So, that a machine can produce professional results with the touch of a button is the sign of some highly intellectual engineering; kudos on that. Lastly, for the app itself, its a joy to use. From remembering previous orders, keeping information secure, streamlining the ordering process and ease of use, and (admittedly not a result of the app, per se) the timeliness of the orders arriving is hands down some of the best customer service around. If you’re thinking about an upgrade from your single serve coffee machine, look no further. Also, beware when you travel from the comfort of your kitchen and are forced to drink lesser coffees again, as it will most likely be all the time. Nespresso is THAT good.","updated":"2020-05-18T13:19:32-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=342879434&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5553215727","userName":"caty21","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id33555685","version":"5.17.4","score":2,"title":"Machine connectivity is secondary & needs improvement","text":"I have both a connected Nespresso machine & the connected Barista milk frother. I also have a machine without Bluetooth connectivity. My machines appear in the order I added them, not allowing me to rearrange their placement. I don’t need to see my non-Bluetooth machine, so I’d prefer to make it last in the list. Instead I have to swipe past it to get to my connected machine. It takes multiple taps & swipes to brew my drink though the app. With the Barista machine, the recipes I DON’T have programmed in my frother appear first. Why? I don’t want those, so instead I have to swipe past to get to the recipes I do have programmed. Finally, there’s only 1 screen that accesses the machines & it’s the first screen. So if you move to another section, it’s then multiple swipes & taps to get back to your machines. \n\nSeems this app is only truly good for ordering—the rest of the info is practically useless. Clearly secondary is the machine connectivity section, which is very disappointing considering that’s the primary reason I need this app. I can order capsules online, so that should be the secondary use of the app, in my opinion. \n\nAnd since this most recent update, the app crashes upon trying to launch, so now there’s that.

They replaced it each time after a long telephone routine... with full history online... and the last time they acted like they were doing me a favor, pointing out the Warranty was nearly at its end!

What that tells me is the company simply does not care about the actual complaints and resolving internal issues to the Customers satisfaction! They have convinced me of a perception of care, but perhaps I am a little to gullible! Perhaps it is time to shop for a new machine, even though I like the Coffee...

There's no one else in the world that doesn't like this. Period. If you're interested in getting a quality coffee and a quality coffee machine, look no further. They are priced reasonably and perform effortlessly and efficiently. I have never had any trouble with my machine. Ever. Period.I am hooked. And I am happy to be hooked. This is one addiction and I am proud to announce.","updated":"2021-12-14T04:50:07-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=342879434&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"7190461314","userName":"karrussell","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id572348346","version":"5.21.6","score":1,"title":"Terrible customer service!","text":"Nespresso makes it difficult to simply add a free sample (though they advertise this option everywhere!) to your order or they “forget” to add it to the box.

If you participate in their recycling program the actual customer, who collects they dirty capsules and transports them to the postoffice, doesn’t benefit from this good deed at all.

The very helpful customer service rep explained that I must have chosen 2 day shipping.  When I worked through the checkout process again, I discovered that 2-day shipping is the default!  Seems to me that the free shipping should be the default if over $50 in sleeves is ordered, allowing users to upgrade to 2-day if they wish to do so.
