Our network is massively better than what it was.  We even have coverage at the back of the yard now.  But there is a glaring oversight in the set up app that is the kind of thing that really bugs me when developers don’t think of possible scenarios.  As you go through set up, there are two instances where the app requires an internet connection.  The new network isn’t set up at this point in the process yet, so that means the app developers have assumed everyone has cell coverage in their homes: I don’t.  So the app just keeps spinning with ‘this should only take a couple minutes’ as it tries to register your account.   \n\nWhy do developers not put in contingencies for this sort of thing?  Why does the app not recognize there is no internet connection and prompt you with a ‘We detected no network, so we’ll register your new account after your set up is complete”  message?  I had to unplug the Ethernet cable in the middle of setup, and set up my old router, just to register my new eero system, then unplug it and replug in the eero, which coincidentally confused the heck out of the app, so i had to restart the whole process.  This happened twice before i got it set up.  I realize it’s probably a small amount of users who dont have cell coverage at home, but this sort of oversight for a product of this caliber (and it is great once it’s working) is frustrating.","updated":"2020-09-07T13:07:30-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1023499075&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"7789943546","userName":"bad27","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id42886667","version":"6.10.0","score":3,"title":"It's definitely NOT Orbi‼️","text":"I just got new fiber optic internet and is the first time I've ever had fiber anything.

You can’t tell if an Eero is working unless you unplug all other Eeros on the network. \n\nContent filtering (i.e. restricting internet content) is assigned to individual devices, which is great for flexibility but is difficult to administer. Each time a new device connects, you receive a notification. That’s good, but by default the new device receives unfiltered internet access. So when your kid’s friend comes over and connects their phone to WiFi, they have unfiltered access until you open the app, identify their device (which is more difficult than it sounds) and assign it to a profile with certain restrictions. \n\nOur family of four has about twenty devices connected at a given time, and each child has about 10 friends who connect occasionally. That’s 40 devices to keep track of, and many of them have identical names such as “iPhone”. \n\nEero could substantially improve the content filtering process if they would let users sort the list of connected devices by how recently the devices connected.

I have cell service, and setting up all 3 only took me a couple minutes and the click of a button. So as long as you have cell service, this is great. Unfortunately I don’t remember seeing anywhere on the box that said you’d need a connection to set up the router. I didn’t see that until I read the setup card inside the box. So this is at the very least some really bad communication on Eero’s part, because a router should have a clearly communicated alternative setup method.\n\nBut my actual complaint, for hundreds of dollars on a router system that marketed great security, no asterisks, I wasn’t expecting that the security it boasts about would have to be through a subscription. Thankfully $3 a month doesn’t really break the bank for me, but it’s the principle of the matter. You can’t market something as having built in malware protection and parental controls and not mention it’s at an additional cost. \n\nOverall the router itself is great, and the app itself is convenient, so it only felt fair to still put 4 stars.

Almost as simple would be to give a  speed test that reports speed from phone to nearest eero unit, though each eero unit in the mesh to the main eero unit and then the internet.
