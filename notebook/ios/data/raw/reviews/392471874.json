It was always true. If space temperature was below set point it meant the boiler was out. I would call my daughter who leaves nearby to have her restart boiler, check fuel level or call for service. I saved a lot of energy with automated ‚Äúaway‚Äù temperature reset. The cost of the unit is very competitive.

When I take it off hold, the app immediately jumps up to the high program set point and turns the AC off, even when I want to have a lower temporary set point and just remove the hold. The thermostat stupidly causes unnecessary cycling of the AC and makes me wait before the AC will turn back on even when it should have never turned it off!\nEither that, or just let me enable/disable the hold setting without mucking with my current set point!\n\nPrevious review (not sure if these problems still persist, as haven't had demand events recently):\nWhen you opt out of a demand event, the app automatically places the system in hold mode!
