EcoNet is like taking a step into the past. It constantly won’t connect to the phone app (no trouble with our old Ecobee), no support for wireless remote sensors (our old Ecobee had this and it was our fav feature. You could set it to use just the bedroom temp sensor to set the proper sleep temp). The EcoNet does support a single wired remote sensors which was incredibly frustrating to install and the thermostat software won’t let you select it as the primary sensor for specific schedules like sleep times). Also the forecast is constantly wrong (for instance 20 degrees off) even after we’ve reset the location 3x’s) \n\nHonestly I’m disappointed and this system needs some major updates to compete. If the development team can create remote wireless sensors support with the ability to schedule when that sensor is to be used I’d be much happier. \n\nRight now if Ecobee or Nest is able to add support for a “communicating” system I’d throw my EcoNet in  the trash and re-install our Ecobee. Rheem please allow this type of support, heck use it as a replacement option.","updated":"2021-11-02T19:19:37-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=853793266&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"8147007804","userName":"KendraJ90","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id120150750","version":"4.0.8","score":1,"title":"Poorly made app and zero acknowledgement from business","text":"Seems like a lot of old feedback/complaints still have never been addressed with this app which is a bad sign for a company.

For the gas only heater the only options are changing the setpoint and switching the unit to vacation mode. However, I have not found that changing the set point from the application has any effect on the actual water temperature in the heater.  After repeated testing, waiting a full day with plenty of water usage between test, changing the setpoint from 110 to 135 degrees always results in water from the heater that his 125 degrees.  I tried to contact customer service about this, but never received any response to my emails.  The application display indicates where the physical switch is on the heater, which becomes the maximum set point.  The blinking indicator light on the units gas controller provides more information than the Wi-Fi unit.  It’s odd that the heater can signal via the flashing LED when the unit is calling for heat, but this information is not passed on to the Wi-Fi  controller and the application.

Incorrect usage report. Sometimes can’t control water heater","text":"With the gen 5 hybrid water heater, Rheem dumbed-down the UI so the customer can no longer see key diagnostic/status info like the water temperature at various levels in the tank. It would be great if these items were available in the app, but they’re not.\n\nThe app tells you even less. The hot water tank “availability” icon is useless. It’s tiny and there’s no documentation or help on what the various colors and levels mean. It may show a thin red line at the bottom. What does that mean? How much hot water is left? Any? After heating for a while, it’ll show a thin blue line.  What does that mean? How much hot water is left? Then it’ll show a thin green line. Same questions. Then it’ll show the green level halfway up the icon. Same questions. Finally, it’ll show the talk all green, even if the compressor is still running. Same questions? How am I supposed to know how much hot water is left, if I should switch the heater to High Demand or Electric mode, etc.?\n\nPlease, Rheem, if diagnostic/status info is recorded by the device and can be sent over Wi-Fi, please upgrade the app to capture and report it! That will be a vast improvement to the product.\n\nBug: The power usage report often shows twice as much power usage as actually occurred on a given day. Generally, that’s 1-2 kWh more that was actually consumed according to my energy monitor, which measures power drawn through the water heater breaker and, separately, the Mains. We also have a Tesla battery Gateway that measures total home power consumption. It agrees with the energy monitor. Neither sees the extra water heater usage the app is reporting. I think I know what’s going on: The app shows 0.2kWh spikes every few hours, which the energy monitor and Gateway don’t see. The compressor is not turning on during these periods. If I add all the 0.2 kWh spikes for a day, the total is the same as the difference in power usage reported by the app and my monitors. So the spikes don’t represent actual power draw. This bug has been reported in earlier reviews and should be fixed by now. But it’s not.\n\nFrom time to time, the heater controls in the app don’t work. I’ll try to change the temp, but the indicator will go from orange to gray. Shortly after that the indicator will go back to orange and my temp change won’t have taken effect. Same happens sometimes when I try to change the operating mode, say from Energy Saver to High Demand. The change just doesn’t take effect. Then a few minutes later I *might* find the change did take effect, as if it was delayed. This is bad because the water heater could be left in an undesired state. It’s probably a communications issue.\n\nFinally, I had trouble getting vacation mode started. I ended up manually lowering the temp to 65F, then turning increasing the temp via the Internet early on the day we came home. I’m not sure if this problem was due to the very poor and confusing UI or a communications problem.\n\nBottom line, this app needs a *lot* of work. It’s simply not up to modern standards for an advanced device like the Rheem hybrid water heater.","updated":"2021-08-30T21:12:21-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=853793266&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"4575350126","userName":"Nickname Seena","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id647243807","version":"4.0","score":2,"title":"App Rating","text":"Liked the older design better.

My home is concrete cement so the heater is in a dead spot, I had to setup a dedicated Wifi AP via power link adapters in the garage for the heater to register with the apps. Also when the appliance loses Wifi connection with EcoNet it will wipe the existence of the appliance from its memory & require to add it in again when connection is re-established. This means all data that was entered & usage history are erased! The ability to remotely monitor the current temperature, setup heating schedules, and appliance health is great! I wish this app could provide more information on appliance’s health (e.g. amps/volts, heating element resistance, etc.) Also have the apps do scheduled checks of the appliance’s current condition & send a text. I can understand why this apps will allow only one user to be registered (security) but it needs a device manager for user authorization, for even changing devices can cause the apps to disconnect from the appliance and do a memory wipe. Also the ability to download the usage history from the apps to a user website account would be good option.

Kudos to Rheem for implementing water heater schedules - that’s very useful, and I presume I’m saving a lot of energy because of it. Like other reviewers, though, I’d really like them to bring back the current water temperature read-out that was in the previous version (v3?). That would be very useful for knowing if there is enough hot water to start a shower, etc. Also, like other reviewers, I’d like to be able to set a temperature lower than 90F. Why not allow completely off? If Rheem have a reason, they should let us know.\n\nFinally, there is a typo “temprature” on the water heater page. The current version has been out for two months, and they haven’t fixed that? They need more QA. 🙁 But overall, if the schedules keep working, I’ll be fairly happy. To add that with an aftermarket device like the Aquanta would be much more expensive, with perhaps other problems. So this is workable, if not perfect.\n\nBTW, I was able to add a new device just fine with iOS 13.3. But the way you need to switch to the EcoNet device’s own WiFi part way through is confusing.
