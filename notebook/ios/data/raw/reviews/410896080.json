This was that one feature I was looking forward to ever since I made the switch to Playstation. As of right now I can edit and share captured screenshots/videos exclusively only on the console itself and nowhere else. I'd understand if editing would have to be done on the console but sharing clips from my library/profile should be an option on the app! Especially with the new PS5 coming out it'd be a great addition to the PS app to be able to seamlessly share our content/trophies etc. to any social media or be able to forward to our friends. Except there's only one option and that too on console, which is Twitter. It's really sad to see how much Playstation emphasizes on 'Sharing' to the point where there's a dedicated button on the controller for it, yet no support on the app itself. It still has the basic most features the last PS App did, but this time it was just revamped with a nice and clean look. I'm hoping that changes once the PS5 is officially released but I'd love to see a sharing/editing feature integrated within the app. I know it's 100% possible and definitely can be done. Overall, great work on the app so far. Hope I'm heard and can expect something out of it in the near future!","updated":"2020-10-28T19:22:28-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=410896080&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"6887216784","userName":"Mel Vz","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1161587004","version":"20.11.1","score":4,"title":"New update could be better..","text":"I love the new update, It looks great! But there are so many things from the older version that i believe makes it better than the newer version. Being able to customize your profiles look by changing your cover image, profile color, and more was a huge deal for me. Customizing group chats was another cool thing. You can do it in the new version, but it has to be with more than two people. In the new version you can’t do as much as the older version. profiles just look so dull to me now. When you start the app you can see what your recently played games are. When you go to your profile, you can also see what your recently games played are. I think that’s unnecessary and boring. I preferred the old layout. Being able to see your friends, who you’re following, and followers was a lot better. Same goes with seeing friends profile. I really don’t want to see just mutual friends. The what’s new page was also removed. I thought that was a great way to see what your friends are up to. what games they started playing and trophies they’re achieving. I love that you can download games to your console and make purchases though the app. It’s a lot faster than doing it on console.","updated":"2021-01-18T21:43:45-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=410896080&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"6649504924","userName":"Itz_Dogzforlife","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id963594454","version":"20.9.4","score":4,"title":"wonderful update, but having an issue...","text":"after just recently switching to the ps4 after a long time of my buggy ps3, i’m still new to not only ps4 but also the ps app. the app is useful don’t get me wrong and the update was really nice but as a gamer who’s always on/in a voice chat the update is kind of annoying. i’ve seen a couple other people have the same problem and i really suggest you fix this for people who like to use wireless gear. \n\nmy problem is that i don’t own any wired headsets, and in order to do my voice chatting from my phone it needs that. i know, i can just go to my nearest store and get a decent wired headset but it’s a waste of money if i spend all this money on wireless gear just for it not to be compatible with playstation.\n\non a good note, the UI is way easier. i used to have a lot of trouble on the older version and often some features wouldn’t even work.

However there are some issues that I have with the PlayStation Network that apply to this app. First, you can no longer change your cover image from the app, or the website for that matter. I have no idea why they removed this feature as now it’s much more difficult to change the cover image, and it often looks worse because you’re having to take a screenshot of something rather than download the image. Second, Playstation does not allow you to delete shared media so if you post anything, it stays on your profile. This is another feature that seems so obvious to have, as sometimes you post something and later don’t want to see it. Third, when you become friends with someone, you automatically follow them and they follow you  back. But if you unfriend them they will still be following you, and you can’t make them unfollow you unless you block them. Once again, it seems only logical to have the ability to control who follows you and who doesn’t but Playstation does not allow you that. If PlayStation could give more freedom to users it would make their network much better.","updated":"2020-12-21T13:31:55-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=410896080&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"6606531263","userName":"ScottIsHot96","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id276486325","version":"20.9.3","score":3,"title":"Update glitches invites on PS4","text":"This new update is pretty bad, has added a number of issues in the PS4 system, as well as not being able to add people to your friends list from the invites you receive.  It’s extremely annoying, and I’m almost wondering if it would be easier to switch to XBOX.  I’ve been an avid ps fan since the ps1, have had every system available.  Now it seems like they don’t care about the people playing anymore, or people who stream.  Why can’t we use remote play to play from our PS4 and stream the gameplay as a secondary screen to a PC or Mac, to then use things like OBS.  Instead you have to connect your controller to the pc, yet be under the same network.  Why have the lag when you could just have the controller connected directly to the PS4 pro and stream from the computer without the lag?  What’s up with these issues?  I’ve contacted Sony support for the PS4 and have gotten the messaging system ended as soon as I ask any question.  It’s seeming extremely dishonorable what SONY has done in the past 6-7 years.  I’ve even offered to buy the M.A.G. Streams back to create a new game comparable with the PS4-ps5, with no luck, no contact information, and absolutely rude feedback from SONY.","updated":"2020-11-03T18:20:06-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=410896080&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"7269120293","userName":"jeff806","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id38843376","version":"21.3.1","score":2,"title":"Don’t bother buying games here","text":"Why did you take away the ability to sort games in the store by release date?

I used to buy games all the time on impulse, but now I never do because you have made it so hard to find new games and add-ons. Great job Sony! I hope you are compensating indie developers somehow since you obviously only want people to see the most popular games that everyone already has on the storefront in the app and on PS5. Like for real, maybe let people choose how they want  PSN games sorted. The way it is now is total trash and I can promise your losing money because you have made it so hard to look for new releases now. I guess you are selling so many new systems you don’t even care.

They have the Photo Gallery right there in the bottom of the interface that lets you see your captures, photos or videos. Just like Stadia. Theirs is right at the bottom of under the games you have. I realize how much work it might take to implement this into an all new designed app, and how much space it could take up to build servers or cloud service to store all photos from the PlayStation family; but your app is behind. 5 stars once it’s added as a feature but it’s just great for now. I only use it rarely because of this lacking (important mind you) feature. Because having to upload to Twitter then save tends to degrade not only the video but wastes time when I could just open the app and save or download the video/photo. Then I’d use this religiously.

The UI is decent but it’s not as fluid as the original UI and has some pointless screens especially in the messages/parties/friends tabs. The overall PlayStation search a user system is broken and annoying now too. You used to be able to search a player’s gamer tag and see the 1 and only result of their name, but now searching a gamer tag often shows a list of unrelated users and friends who share key words with the name you searched and lists the one person you searched somewhere in the middle of all of that and if you’re lucky they’ll appear as the very last result. Sometimes the user won’t even appear at all and you have to go through the same process on the console to get what you want. Also I miss the feature to turn on the PlayStation from the app if both were on the same network. Overall combining all the PlayStation apps was definitely a necessary move, but in doing so we have lost key features from each of the individual apps and some very simple features are too hard to access on the new app now.","updated":"2021-06-22T11:46:42-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=410896080&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"6640909684","userName":"dansington","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id31413408","version":"20.9.4","score":2,"title":"Looks great, buuut pretty disappointed","text":"1st, there is no wishlist.

It was a nice way to have a list of all the games I thought looked interesting that I might pick up someday. But nope. It’s already hard to find indie games on here so if you come across one you might pick up, you’d better write it down somewhere. Makes me think they want to make it harder to get deals so they can get people to pay full price more often.\n2nd, it’s glitchy. I’ve put 3 games in my cart, but when I try to pull up the cart it’s just a blank screen. Like nothing on it. \nIn conclusion, it looks nice. It’s easier to scroll through.

Messages being intergrated into the app and the fact that you can actually buy things off the PSN are both welcomed changes, but all the accessibility that was in the original app needs to return. Profile customization, themes, I personally enjoyed the fact that close friends or family could see your actual picture with the Avatar made it so much more personal.

I’m deleting the app from my phone entirely as I don’t need it anymore.","updated":"2021-01-15T10:33:29-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=410896080&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"4582025924","userName":"Iggy Belmont","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1024310713","version":"19.07.0","score":4,"title":"One Thing is missing","text":"I use the Xbox app to talk to my friends and play but then for the PS App I was looking to see if I can Start a party to talk to my friends on PS4 because I don’t own a PS4 but have a account but I was wondering will you ever make a Party section so other people like me can Inv their friends to play another game Example like Smash because that’s when I was checking","updated":"2019-08-07T07:59:56-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=410896080&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"3688420877","userName":"meh no thanx","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id667191405","version":"18.12.1","score":3,"title":"Stop logging me out","text":"This is probably very minor but it annoyed me to no end. I would log in to the app, use it and close. A few days later i would use it and it had me log in again with my email and password. I dont have that issue on any of my other playstation products so i found it very annoying on the app. Annoyed enough that i just deleted it. Thank u for the time i did use it.","updated":"2019-01-24T02:18:02-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=410896080&type=Purple%20Software"}]
