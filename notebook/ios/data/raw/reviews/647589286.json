First, the app doesn’t allow me to turn my pump on AFTER opening a valve.  This causes my system pressure to rise to 130 psi for 4-5 seconds until the valve opens and returns to normal which is 25 psi. This over pressure situation happens at the beginning and end of each cycle.  Not everyone needs this functionality, but everyone in my community (central FL with well and pump) does... and I think a S/W update would fix it.  Also, connecting the device to my wifi was frustrating.  I literally ran through the setup sequence- which did not fully conform to the instructions- over a dozen times before it connected.  I would have quit earlier but my other crappy device (a pet feeder) gave me the same trouble so I stuck it out and just kept trying until it connected.  Recently we lost power for over an hour causing the rain machine to lose connection.  Reconnecting it to wifi again frustrated me nearly to the point of tossing it out.  I’ve had an automatic sprinkler system for many years and this controller is really no better than the previous ones except for the convenience of accessing it through my phone.

It’s really cool that I can stand in my garden and if it needs more water I can just press a button on my phone. Just yesterday my landscapers wanted to put fertilizer on the lawn but needed me to water it first and I was able to do that from work. The best part is being able to stop watering when I want to take a shower and the water pressure is low because the sprinklers are on.

It is worth the effort to research other similar products within the competitive market before purchasing Rainmaker. They have a 2.8 rating out of 5.

I bought Rainmaker without doing my homework and troubles me for not following through on other similar products. Especially with the money i spent for the unit and installation. Best of luck to all! Also the amount of watering this year from the unit saturated my yard and now have water in my cellar. The sump pump was dry for years unit I had this unit installed.

It might have been really useful but falls short due to very poor scheduling algorithms. On the surface, they claim to take into account a multitude of parameters like rain amount, evaporation rate, and other factors affecting moisture retention. In reality, the scheduling makes no sense.  I’m not sure if basic sanity checks were ever done, let alone comprehensive performance testing. Today we got 2.3 inches of rain as recorded by the connected rain gauge. For whatever reason, instead of using the actual measurement they somehow came up with 1.5 in of rain.  Even with that number, one expects that watering should be paused for a while. But no - I have scheduled 150% watering for tomorrow, and 100% two days after that. I had to deactivate the program to prevent this insanity. \nIn summary - if you need a device that you can manually control with your phone it will do the trick. If you want to rely on some “smart” scheduling you are out of luck. Congratulations - you bought yourself an irrigation system remote!

(Seriously, how many people actually have more than ONE of these?) This is a totally pointless step. It would be a much better user experience if they would add an option in Settings that allowed us to choose which screen we wanted to see first when we open the app. I can't imagine any homeowner in the world actually WANTING to see this screen. It's waste of time forcing us to \"choose\" the device every single time we open the app when we only have ONE device! Why not take us directly to the Dashboard screen? We've been asking for this change forever, but they keep ignoring us!\n- We shouldn't have to go into Settings to see our Watering History. This really should be another graphical section on the Dashboard screen that we can tap on to see more detailed info. One of the main things we want to see when we quickly pop into this app is, \"What have the watering patterns looked like over the past week/month?\" Besides, \"watering history\" is NOT a \"Setting\" anyway.\n\nThe bottom line is, I'm thrilled with this product, and only wish I'd gotten it sooner! The ability to check on my system from anywhere and make whatever schedule changes I want to from my phone is extremely helpful. If you're on the fence about buying this... DO IT!

Even more importantly, so far the watering system itself has worked as advertised.\n\nThe Bad: There have been occasions where I needed to forcably close the app to get it to connect or get some piece of the UI unstuck. The UI itself occasionally seems to be missing pieces. (For instance, under Settings > Weather, the app currently tells me I've changed the \"field capacity\" from it's default, but the app no longer seems to have any UI to change this setting. Also of note, unfortunately this setting itself behaves somewhat oddly and even when set to 1 day will prevent potted plants that need and are otherwise set for daily watering from being watered up to 4 days after the last rain during the winter, when it's colder outside.)\n\nThe Ugly: The app really doesn't conform to iOS look and feel, using familiar UI elements that act in very non-iOS ways. Appearance-wise, the app isn't even entirely consistent with itself, using a mess of different font sizes and control styles. Also, the app seems to assume, somewhat strangely, that there's a good change I have multiple Rain Machine devices I want to control, and makes me select my single device from a single-element list every time I open it. None of this affects functionality, but it doesn't exactly reflect well on the quality of work that went into designing the app.","updated":"2017-04-05T23:46:58-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=647589286&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1517974218","userName":"Jguz56","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id272570187","version":"4.3.101","score":1,"title":"No Improvement","text":"Update: Nov 2016:  As in prior years, my Rain Machine disconnected sometime during the summer (this time in August) and of course for whatever glitchy reason I could not access it remotely. Western NC was suffering severe drought in October. I arrived at my Lake home in early November hoping to find my Rain Machine controller functioning, only to find it with the screen frozen and no matter how I attempted to reboot it, it came back to the same frozen screen. All my landscape was severely parched and the one time I really counted on Rain Machine to perform, it failed. It's now in the garbage can, I purchased a Rachio. \n\nUpdate: Apr 2016:  I like the addition of historical and projected watering data. However, the whole reason I bought this device was to monitor watering at my vacation home remotely.  Sporadically, I still get a \"Sprinkler does not respond\" message. I have other apps that I use for home monitoring, etc and I can reliably access all of them so I know the problem is not with my local internet service. The problem lies somewhere in how the Rain Machine app was written. I have been putting up with this remote access problem for 3 years...still no resolution. Frustrating. \n\n2014:  So excited for update, but no improvement. I get very slow response. Most of the time I get a request timed out message.

The device is OK, probably fine as a non-internet connected dumb touchscreen scheduler. That way you can also keep it from spying on you and monetizing your info. Just give it a remote! Also, relying on the app to use the internet weather and adaptive watering is folly. It kept skipping watering for the whole week because we got a tenth of an inch of rain (probably on the other side of town.) Not transparent or predictable. App does not have good data for dry climates, xeriscape, or heavy clay soil. Slowly I have been backing off from relying on this product. Now I set manual schedules, plastic rain gauges, etc. Often I just leave it off and press the button to water when it’s appropriate. So… it’s still great to be able to use my phone to turn the zones on and off while I’m setting up the sprinklers.

I have no idea what is actually selected.  I found this within 5 minutes of installing the device and the app.  Developer should have found it immediately as well.  It’s obvious that the code wasn’t tested.\n\nNow it deleted all of the zone images I just spent time putting in.  Very buggy.\n\nAfraid to update it now as it has been so buggy and it’s working at the moment.  Also  to whoever is writing the notes on the latest fix, it’s “losing” when something is lost, not “loosing” which is what you do with an arrow and a bow! :)","updated":"2020-08-16T09:43:35-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=647589286&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5882228347","userName":"Enraged Medic","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1151142610","version":"4.6.107","score":2,"title":"Non stop spinning wheel","text":"Latest update 4/27 renders the app useless.
