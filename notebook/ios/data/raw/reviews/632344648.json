Also, it will no longer connect via bluetooth to my MacBook Pro. I tried to return the speaker but it was beyond the return date.

This convinced me to go buy the MB3 after thinking about it for several weeks. I happen to have both speakers. Ehhh, NO. The Bose still sounds better IMHO. The most notable thing was that the MB3 lacks bass, even when cranking up the bass on the custom EQ. And the frustrating part is the app. While the app is cool to operate your speaker ie: turn it on/off remotely etc. BUT set the EQ to your custom settings and when done with the speaker, turn it off with the app then turn the speaker back on and guess what! The app does NOT save your custom EQ settings to memory. Nowhere in the app settings can you save your custom EQ to memory. I turned the speaker on and off several times just to make sure and sure enough, those custom EQ settings were gone every time. This was a major pain. Portable speakers like these will never fill a room full of REALLY LOUD music; I get that. But at least make it crank the bass so it won’t sound like music coming from a tin can. That’s why Bose is Bose folks...
