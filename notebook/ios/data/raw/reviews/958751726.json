And we have children. I must say that after trying numerous smart devices, the most important aspect is that your products function for years to come without failure and with very minimal maintenance and upgrades. Avi-on smart plugs have been functioning well in our home. We experienced glitches and inconveniences with their software upgrades. Once the software was settled and glitches fixed, the lights are working as expected. We want to keep our kids safe and sound at home. The smart plugs products have helped us achieve that for 3 years now. We bought ours in the stores. Here is another thing: we do not want to spend $40 on smart devices. This is way too expensive for ordinary American families. It adds up fast with every single device and software costs. It is too too much. Who can afford $400 iPhones year after year?!? Oh maybe software makers can!?! They make good money. But we don’t!! We buy what we need, not what we like!  So I got my Avion plug for $25 at a local store, which was affordable price. Others weren’t as lucky as I. After 3-4 years, my Avi-on products are still all working in my home with zero maintenance and no fail. So I am a very happy Mom.

There has not been any more firmware upgrade thank goodness.   However there are still some gremlins from time to time.  All my devices disappeared out of the blue last week.   Logging off/on didn’t help.  Had to delete and reinstall the app to get back my devices.  \n\nUpgrading to 3 stars.  When the app is stable Avi-on is actually quite nice to use.  Fingers crossed that the app stays stable and continue to improve. \n\n—————————-\nOriginal post :  upgrade nightmare \nI use 5 of these things to control everything from landscaping lighting to recirculating water pumps.  They worked really well and were easy to set up.  All was good until came time for upgrade.\nApp upgrade was bad, firmware upgrade on the devices was a nightmare.\nUpgraded the app several times over the past year.  Issues include lost schedule, lost devices and now, duplicated devices.  Each of my device now have a clone.  Removing the duplicate made it worse.  The device stopped working completely. Forcing the device to resync with the app just caused the app to crash.\nThen came the firmware upgrade.  There were two upgrades in the last few months. That doesnt sound too bad except the firmwate upgrade has to be done on each device individually and it requires turning Bluetooth on/off couple of times during the upgrade process.  It's a time consuming process and to make things worse, something would usually go wrong during or after the upgrade.  \nI haven't figured out how to fix the latest batch of issues.  Might have to go the nuclear option and do a hard reset on all the devices and start over.   Not looking forward to it.  \nAvi-on, you have a nice product but your software department needs to get the act together.   A device like this should just work.  It shouldn't be a hassle or a headache to run.  It performs a very simple task so just keep it simple.

This app works to dim my LED lights and it’s possible to set a schedule to turn them on at specific times with specific dimness. However, there are several features that could be better. \n1. Setting the dimness is not very precise. I often like my lights between 8%-30% bright. The digital slider is very difficult to land on either of these numbers or even settle on one. When sliding from 25% down to 10, lifting the finger off the screen can swing the value 10 or more because the slider size is only maybe a 1/4” inch between 0 and 30. Having a better way to Zoom into low values would help greatly. \n2.  It’s takes an infinity to open and connect to the lights. Like 10 seconds or more. This time, when wanting the lights on or off, seems like forever. The app has to find the light every time it opens, even if you just closed it. There has got to be a remembered connection to hasten the connection. \n3.  I am pretty good with figuring even complex systems and softwares, but this app nearly takes the cake for being non intuitive. Setting the schedule to turn on the lights at 6:30am with a dimness starting at 5% and slowly rising to 20% is possible.  But it might take an hour of messing with the app to make it work. It could be way easier. \n4.  If a schedule is set, you can’t then override the schedule with the light switch on the way. If you do turn off the scheduled lights with the paddle, the lights go crazy and start flickering like mad. I have attempted several ways to get around this but all have failed. \nSo, it works but could be so much better.","updated":"2019-08-21T18:46:11-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=958751726&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1790431907","userName":"Homeeoo","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id377893691","version":"1.6.2","score":1,"title":"No longer working","text":"Not happy Bob","updated":"2017-09-14T19:31:02-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=958751726&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"4834136491","userName":"Stupidery","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id219534598","version":"1.11.2","score":1,"title":"Very bad App","text":"It does’nt turn on as scheduled.","updated":"2019-09-24T19:13:12-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=958751726&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"3143408420","userName":"still diappointed99","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id284350404","version":"1.8.3","score":1,"title":"Scam","text":"App doesn’t work... ever!","updated":"2018-09-01T21:20:51-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=958751726&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"3812039247","userName":"Steven.Hartney","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id177397971","version":"1.9.0","score":3,"title":"FIX THE APP 4 IPHONE X","text":"FIX THE APP FIR IPHONE X ..

He then activated the firmware updates that would allow me to see the yellow exclamation points on the devices that needed firmware updates. Great. But, the app still wouldn't connect to my devices. So, I went outside and tried to connect to an outdoor switch, and guess what? It did! This allowed me to update the firmware on that switch and reset my schedules. I then went back inside the house and updated the inside switch that the app wouldn't see in the first place. So on edit, the app now works and I changed my review to 3 stars. IMHO while the app works, to get a higher rating it would have to be easier to update the switch firmware.","updated":"2017-09-12T02:31:30-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=958751726&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1224179241","userName":"alexcgross","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id37686294","version":"1.0","score":5,"title":"Avi-on App for my driveway light","text":"I have a driveway lamp that I use at night to light my driveway and for security when I am away from home.

Only when the app is closed will the device operate. When I do have the app open it says that no devices are found. Really? Well if the device is on it finds the device without problem and turns it off.\nI have a second issue with this app in that it attempts to login every time the app is started. Login? Why ever should a Bluetooth controlling device need to login?  I understand if I had multiple devices attached to the app and they were spaced around the world then maybe having a location login then maybe...\n The concept of Bluetooth is that it is local only and device restricted. My Bluetooth earbuds are not required to \"log in\" and they work 100% as advertised. My device was not inexpensive and I would expect for the price the same performance as my earbuds. There is something fishy about this logging in.

I would NOT recommend this product to anyone.  The app itself is poorly designed and is very counterintuitive.  The “Outdoor Smart Switch” ought to be called the “Dumb Switch”.  I purchased this dumb switch about a month ago and it worked just fine, with the outdoor lights set up on the timer option... took a bit to get it set up though.  But now, it is COMPLETELY unresponsive... I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app on both android and apple devices, separately, and I tried resetting the switch by unplugging it and plugging it back in...  the app keeps saying that it cannot find my network and the dumb switch itself will turn on the lights briefly and then shut itself off.  This is a bad product and poorly constructed app, and is not worth your time or money.  I would rate this zero stars if I had the option.  If by some miracle the makers of this product are able to resolve these problems, I will update this review, but until then, give this a hard pass and save your money for something with better quality.","updated":"2019-01-13T21:20:23-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=958751726&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"3308474987","userName":"angivic","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id102944464","version":"1.9.0","score":1,"title":"The difficulty of a good idea","text":"It must really be hard to have such a good idea and have the delivery of that idea be so bad.

They are simple to set up, simple to use, and reliable.  The advantage of Bluetooth is low power and user complexity, while WiFi offers greater benefits but more overhead and a potential path to hack your home network- so I think GE made the right choice for the time.\n\nThe Avi-On app is deceivingly powerful, as you can use it both as a simple remote as well as an easy interface to program schedules with a lot of capability:  from/to dawn/dusk, particular hours can be mixed in, as well as days of the week, yielding possibilities such as “turn the front light on at dawn until 9:00 am on Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays.”  And it’s even more flexible as you can have up to 10 schedules per switch.  So you could add “Turn the front light on at dusk until 11:00 pm.on Wednesdays.”  You would then get the sum of both schedules.\n\nThere is also a countdown timer you can use ad-hoc, and a variety of subscription based features to create grouped functionality, like presets for a room of lights.  IMHO the world is full of far too many hi-tech companies delusional that everyone will agree to pay monthly - in this case potentially forever - to have some small service like this.  So we’ll stick with the great bundled capabilities.  \n\nI should mention, though, that you will need to set up a free on-line account to enable any lasting functionality.  The benefit is your device programming and settings are backed up.  And I have found their on-going customer support to be exceptional.  This includes help with the product, as well as rapid turn around in the rare case you identify a software issue.\n\nReally my main complaints are twofold.  One is that EVERY SINGLE TIME an update is pushed, you have to log back in to the controller.  This is terrible, and if they want to survive they must address this.  I have >50 apps on my iPhone; if I had to do this with all of them I’d throw my phone away!\n\nThe other, which might be unavoidable, is how long the app takes to refresh EVERY TIME YOU SWITCH TO IT.  Beyond annoying, and another show stopper to real market adoption.\n\nBut for now if you have a short list of items you’d find handy to remotely switch, this is any easy way to get it done.  It sure helped while I spent the first half of this year recovering from both cancer and a violent assault, allowing me to switch lights and such while stuck in my recliner.  Or turning Christmas lights outside on and off, while warm inside!\n\nHope this is helpful to someone.","updated":"2018-06-11T05:09:27-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=958751726&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"2359478592","userName":"Constant Rider","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id504301458","version":"1.8.0","score":1,"title":"App is trash","text":"Update - Returned this device the next day, instead bought the Kasa Smart WiFi switch on amazon and it works.

I have a vacation home in a rural area that takes power hits at least once a month.  I was an early adopter of the RAB which has been steadily improved.  With the latest software, the RAB will resync with my timers.  The lights now come on and off when they should after power outages.  No more mechanical timers that get progressively off time.  I sent a lot of issues to Avi-on support along the way and they were very responsive.  Didn’t get the software developed any faster, but the important part is they did get the features developed and working.\n\nI use an iPad and Android smartphone to manage my devices.  The iPad seems to correctly pick up the state of my devices.  The Android smartphone doesn’t.
