They are all directly Ethernet wired to the same Ethernet switch...they should have no trouble finding each other. I have set this system up now every day for the last week...which takes 10 minutes each time...because it loses the speakers every time you stop using the app. Every time. So the next time you fire up the app you need to reconfigure your whole system all over again...factory restarts of all three components and having the dialogue find the speakers again.  \nIf I could return them I would, but I bought them a few months back while building a house and now I am past the return window. I also have Sonos speakers and while they are inferior in sonic quality, the Sonos app works every time. Every time ... \nDevialet should stop putting R&D into more powerful speakers and just get the app right first.","updated":"2016-10-13T19:32:00-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=964281562&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5042684782","userName":"Yenkee Doodle","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id724559849","version":"1.11.3","score":1,"title":"Piece of crap","text":"The Phantom / Dialog combo has been around for a few years now, but till now, Devialet can’t get their act together.

Even as a single Bluetooth speaker, it keeps disconnecting every few minutes.\n\nMy Sonos back from 2004 plays every time with no hiccups. Same for the Apple HomePod, unlike this Devialet junk.\n\nThe Phantom manages to play, the music is clear cut above both Sonos and the HomePod.

In the end, I prefer to use the Sonos and the HomePod, with the Phantoms as decorative objects.\n\nDevialet should stop bragging about having the best wireless speaker in the world and all their marketing mumbo jumbo.
