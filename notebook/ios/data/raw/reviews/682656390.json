It should be adjustable by user.\nAlso it would be an improvement to use a snapshot photo for a device rather than rely on the few canned photos that do not match a user’s device.

The iDevices home screen and the Apple Home app both use a multi level approach for users to identify the device they want to control. The iDevices app “forgets” this on all menus except the home screen. If I am looking at energy usage, or a scene, I would like to know if a device I named “Lamp”, for example, is in the upstairs bedroom, or the office! My point is, the app should always show the Room, then the device name. Not everyone wants to take a descriptive photo to identify each device. Even if they did, the icons in many lists are so small, it may not help much.  I suggest every list of devices show Room, then Name to help solve this problem.","updated":"2019-12-12T16:07:47-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=682656390&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"3755312015","userName":"ateslik","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id48821075","version":"4.0.2","score":5,"title":"Works great","text":"I bought 17 of the dimmer switches for my home, and they work amazingly well.

Both previous apps allowed landscape and portrait views - this one doesn't - and should. Both previous apps made it far easier to set threshold temps and alarms and work with them once they are reached, this one will do it, but you have to hunt to figure out how. The previous app alarms went off once when the target temp was reached, this app's alarms sound continuously once the target temp is reached then you must select \"no target temp\" to get it to shut off. With the previous versions of this app, the timers, timer alarm sound settings and additional features were FAR easier to access as they made up the whole right hand side of the main screen, the current version's drop down menu is very fiddly and does not allow you to monitor both the timer and chamber/food temps simultaneously. The connectivity is much better with this version though. What this app really needs is to be able to set a high/low range with alarms to indicate if the grill temp goes either higher or lower than the target range. With a range setting, a return to the previous version's screen design and the connectivity of this new version, this would be a PERFECT application for grilling… I do much low and slow\" and much smoking and the concept here is a godsend though iDevices hasn't quite got the execution quite right yet.","updated":"2014-06-07T13:18:06-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=682656390&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"3885637212","userName":"Kevin Goodrich","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id524419521","version":"4.0.2","score":2,"title":"New review","text":"Modules may lose network connection, if router wifi network is turn off and turned on hours later.","updated":"2019-03-15T15:30:59-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=682656390&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"7856077731","userName":"ThatIsSoSteve","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id42906608","version":"4.1.10","score":1,"title":"IDevices with two outlet for outdoor","text":"Ios15 broke the two plug outdoor.

With its recent update, iDevices makes HomeKit THE home automation platform of the year...:.:.:.:.:.:. And for years to come. \nWith its A+ hardware and now A+ software, iDevices allowed me to delete more than 2 pages of apps in a folder that use to sit on my home screen. Now it's Just iDevices Connected on my iPhone 6s Plus, Apple Watch, iPad Air 2, and wall mounted iPad Mini 3 ( WITH LANDSCAPE MODE). \nNothing else to say. It's a free app. Download it, make HomeKit stable, and see what I'm talking about. \nGREAT JOB GUYS. \n----  ♛ JuST BLeSSeD ♛","updated":"2015-12-01T05:51:26-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=682656390&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1262717586","userName":"RR96","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id104789855","version":"2.0","score":4,"title":"Great App","text":"The app is nice minus one thing.
