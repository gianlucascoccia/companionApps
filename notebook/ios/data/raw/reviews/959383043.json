Central air conditioning is not a thing here and all buildings that are air conditioned have mini split units. These are fine because if a unit goes down it means just that room is down until you can get it fixed. The downside to these units is that there is no way to have a temperature based auto on/off like with a thermostat so at night you go to bed and wake up freezing then turn it off and wake up a while later sweating from heat or the AC just runs all night long. We have 4 sensibo units in our home (1 for each AC unit) and 2 in our business. We use the climate react feature to set an upper end limit to switch the unit on in a given room and a lower end limit to switch the unit off. We sleep better at home and when we are busy at work it keeps the temperature comfortable for our clients without any attention from us. Maintaining a temperature range means the ac units aren’t running as much and our bank accounts have noticed - can’t recommend enough!","updated":"2021-03-25T15:19:16-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=959383043&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"7065093239","userName":"Not-Mozart","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id142642276","version":"3.3.30","score":1,"title":"Super Confusing UX for Mini-Split controller","text":"I can only assume the UX designer is thoroughly frustrated because nobody listens to them and their app is a confusing disaster because of it. \n\nThe main problem is it’s impossible to tell what happens when you leave the geofencing area. You have two options. Turn the heat off, which will presumably freeze the pipes in a couple hours, or Climate React which costs money, also turns off, and has zero explanation what is supposed to happen anyway.  It would make a lot more sense for a smart temperature control feature to turn ON and then have a temperature range — instead, leaving the geofencing area turns things off and there’s basically no clarity as to what happens when you leave home. \n\nAlso the UI is a little wonky, but that’s a very minor complaint to seemingly being unable to fulfill the main purpose of the hardware. \n\nBranding looks nice though. Cool monster illustration.\n\nEDIT: I’ve contacted support and apparently it’s not designed to maintain a more energy efficient temperature when you leave. If I want it to be 60° when I leave in the winter and 72° when I’m home... I have to manually set it every single time. That’s the only reason I bought this and why I bought the annual subscription. Took me 20min to realize this product seemed wrong, and a few days to verify it’s not possible to do anything I need it to.","updated":"2021-03-04T10:35:06-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=959383043&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"7806351030","userName":"wjhsong","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id175865336","version":"3.3.46","score":1,"title":"Gradually become more disappointing","text":"I have been using a group of sensibo devices at home and office for almost three years so far. I really liked them at the beginning, then I find them more and more disappointing as Sensibo gains more users and the app adds more functionalities. My complaint is that it does not work when I need it! Unresponsive, lagging, errors… For instance, climate react option is a joke. It fails to work correctly about 1 out of 10 times - it’s a big failure rate. When it fails, rooms are left either very cold or hot because sensibo was supposed to turn off or on but does not! Log history says it sent a signal that did not change the state. Urgh!!!!! Unfortunately, I feel that the failure rate is gradually becoming worse not better. Climate react is just one of many fail examples.

Sensibo does NOT have this problem. \n\nCons\nIf you have more than one head for a ductless system, the app doesn’t have a universal on/off capability. \n\nIt could also benefit from a smart feature that automatically runs the fan after air conditioning to help dry out the system. \n\nThe paid app upgrade features are marginally helpful but way overpriced.

It does a great job of letting me control my system to a tighter temperature control band than the built in LG control system. \n\nMy basic heating need/program:\nSet my system temp to a desired target temp in the morning, crank it up a bit before bed. Then set it down at night. \n\nMy LG heat pump system thermostat doesn’t have a schedule, and it’s only got +-2 degrees of control resolution in heating which is terrible for comfort. \n\nSensibo can save the day with climate react and scheduling. Sounds easy, right? Well you have to do a lot of settings programming to get this to work. When you get it setup it will deliver. But you will sometimes get random bugs, like all your schedules disabling themselves. The biggest issue is there is no master control to turn off the system. If I power off the system from the main app window, it just turns it off for right now, my schedules will still come in and change everything climate react will still come in and change everything.  So if I want to do the equivalent of “System Off” that my Honeywell thermostat will do, I have to go to the main app and turn off the unit, go into my schedule and disable all three schedules, go into climate react settings and turn off climate react. It’s like the developer got basic functions working initially and then bolted on feature after feature without thinking about how a user wants to interact with a heating system. It’s February, I’m in heating mode yesterday was extra warm. How do I just turn my system off?\nAlso how is this going to work in the Summer? Three more climate react schedules where I have 7:00am,7:00pm,10:00pm for heating mode and 7:01am,7:01pm,10:01pm for cooling? And I guess I just remember that’s how it works? God help me explaining this to my family. \n\nSo I’m really glad the Temperature controls and readout have 0.1F of resolution or the system would be useless to me. But I’m really disappointed that they charge a monthly fee for the basic feature of nightly setbacks, and then they execute it so poorly.","updated":"2021-03-02T05:41:06-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=959383043&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"4400226809","userName":"555sexydrive","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id26663911","version":"2.45","score":4,"title":"Want to give it a 5, but...","text":"The application keeps closing on me every time I attempt to set my location up.

Their recent products are the 2.0 evolution of concept - adding more intelligence like climate react and presence detection - making the system even ‘smarter’. But the execution on these new features is lacking - the design to make these new capabilities work is very clunky - more like programming an IFTTT set of instructions than a simple ‘I want to do this’ guided experience. The average consumer is not going to want the hassle of figuring out how to take multiple settings, put them together, and make it work.  On top of that - it does not consistently work - so you can program in schedules but then they randomly disable themselves. So not only is there the confusing interface design but then you have to figure out is it your ‘program’ that is not working or their application that is not working again. Adding one more layer to the frustration is after buying the system, they try and upsell on more ‘advanced features’ that cost you more money, greater interface complexity to use, and even more frustration at the realization that the extra money you spent is a further waste as it does not actually work consistently! The product has a great technology base but time to go back to the drawing board to actually make it useful and consistent for the consumer.","updated":"2020-08-21T04:58:38-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=959383043&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5910502180","userName":"ggrr8googlyboogly","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id350079404","version":"2.56","score":5,"title":"Works for me","text":"I have had the sensibo modules for about a year? now.

Not Siri Shortcuts, but shortcuts - the kind you can put on your lock screen, etc. Even with 'Open app when run' unchecked, the app has to open every time you try to execute a \"shortcut,\" which turns what USED to be a simple thing (iPhone laying on the desk, tap the screen to wake it, slide to the right, hit the shortcut button to turn on/off the A/C) into a much more complicated procedure: iPhone laying on the desk, tap the screen to wake it, slide to the right, hit the shortcut button to turn on/off the A/C, get a passcode prompt to unlock the phone, pick up the phone to initiate FaceID scan, wait for the passcode screen to come up because you didn't scan your face fast enough, unlock the phone, wait for the Sensibo app to open, wait for the \"shortcut\" to execute. \n\nAm I the only one who thinks this is absurd? Better yet, didn't Sensibo's developers actually TEST the app before releasing it? This is ridiculous. (Yes, I know, first-world problems. But I DID spend hundreds of dollars on my Sensibo setup, and having its functionality nerfed like this, a year later, is incredibly irritating)","updated":"2020-06-21T18:26:45-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=959383043&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"6064134136","userName":"Andre Chew","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id42508426","version":"3.3.1","score":1,"title":"Do not update!","text":"App fails to load after updating to 3.3.0 & 3.3.1 😕 Please fix this.","updated":"2020-06-11T12:10:56-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=959383043&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"4969707848","userName":"hoffyboy","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id12663641","version":"2.50","score":1,"title":"The app isn’t allowing me to set schedules","text":"The app isn’t allowing me to set schedules","updated":"2019-10-18T15:53:43-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=959383043&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"2987139894","userName":"Jimbo40","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id24288484","version":"2.31","score":1,"title":"Doesn’t Work","text":"Told my remote is not comparable.","updated":"2018-07-29T05:14:27-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=959383043&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"6068152507","userName":"Jim393939393","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id315122845","version":"3.3.1","score":1,"title":"can’t even open the app after the update","text":"can’t open app","updated":"2020-06-12T13:35:11-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=959383043&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"6275941560","userName":"Nickname-827262","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id19249310","version":"3.3.13","score":1,"title":"The app just gets worse and worse!

In my book, this is called “extortion”.  I am NOT satisfied with this answer.\n\n— original review —\n\nSort by recent reviews, and ignore the ones on July 20 that are obviously made by a PR firm trying to cover for them.\n\nIf you recently bought one of these, do yourself a favor and return it.  I have never been so angry about a product as I am about this one.  Frankly, this should be at lawsuit levels.\n\nI’ve been using Sensibo devices for two years and they used to be great.  I used to recommend them to friends and family, and now they’re all mad at me because this year they made a bunch of changes to their app to make it “prettier” and it has totally broken most features.  Power sync state fails every single day.  Schedules now are useless as they’re overriden by temperature react.  Geolocation causes the app to lock up entirely.  Latest iOS/App version.  This has been going on for months and getting progressively worse and worse.  Today I removed all of the devices and am controlling my AC manually again, because whatever moron programmed the app redesign has TOTALLY and COMPLETELY destroyed all core functionality in the app.","updated":"2020-08-03T11:29:55-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=959383043&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"7585635742","userName":"Dan.Rossiter","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id329223753","version":"3.3.42","score":1,"title":"New Release Broke Alexa Control","text":"Latest release resulted in Alexa skill no longer working. “Amazon Echo sent a command that didn’t change the state.” Every time now.
