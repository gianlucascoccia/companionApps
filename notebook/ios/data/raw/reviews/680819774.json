In Google, I have to select the category thermostats and then an individual device before I see any information. That's two additional clicks pet device instead of just being able to see it all at once. In Nest, I could invite anyone to join the home by entering their email address. It would send them an email invite with a link that would walk them through setting up their account. In Google, it simple tells me I can only add people with a Google account. I have to tell them to go setup an account on their own and then add them later. That is not a friendly experience. I can only see one camera at a time.

If you’re going to create a minimalist control for smart home devices, then at least make the options you do present meaningful and functional. The almost psychotic, scatterbrained placement of functions (some preferences are in one place, others in a totally different, unrelated place) is maddening. At least start making your hardware compatible with HomeKit or even Geeni for god’s sake so the user experience isn’t destroyed by this app. Seriously, Geeni is a better smart home manager app… this scattershot, unintuitive interface is why I traded in my Galaxy for an iPhone and have never looked back, and this only serves to remind me why.","updated":"2021-11-30T00:14:29-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=680819774&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"2145902662","userName":"Darkslayer24","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id42585951","version":"1.26.812","score":5,"title":"I love Google home","text":"Google home mini has made my life better.

We just bought a 2nd generation indoor Nest cam but didn’t realize we cannot use the Nest app with it; it only works with Google Home. This is dumb, since it’s labeled as a Nest product. \n\nOne big issue for us is that you cannot mute the audio from the cameras in the app, even when your phone is muted. This is a problem because we use it as a crib monitor next to our bed, and if the baby is fussing and we’re monitoring from bed, he’ll hear it and probably fuss more. This will literally cause us to lose sleep, in other words. \n\nAlso, the camera histories are not as reliable in Google Home. On our doorbell, for example, images of the same event are viewable in the Nest app but Google Home says they’re not retrievable. Navigating to the camera histories is not as intuitive in Google Home and requires more clicks than in Nest.  \n\nA similar but less significant issue is the format of the app. Nest has images/icons that are more informative and easier to quickly navigate than what is in Google Home. \n\nI was initially happy with Nest, but I’ve been increasingly dissatisfied since they were purchased by Google. The changes they’ve implemented suggest their primary goal is to collect data on my family and home, and the user experience has become secondary.

For example, Google home sometimes does not register “light 6” aka our “bathroom light” when I give the command to turn it on, sometimes multiple times.
