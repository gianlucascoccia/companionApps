But when a pandemic comes around and millions of dollars in WiFi and cable bills aren’t paid. Because of people that are out of work and can’t pay their cable bill. Xfinity finally wakes up and properly services the good paying American citizens. \nTherefore, will say that at a time when Xfinity is going through hard times, would definitely recommend their services. \nAs for my bill doubling in the second year of service. Even with inflation. It’s just not worth 200 a month for an alarm, WiFi and cable I’ve only watched for an hour in years. Like the original price. But, after a couple years, seems they now do as agreed, (finally, after years) monitoring my house without foolish interruptions of my business. Less frequent senseless outages. Now then, I have no complaints. But, the dealing with their equipment and services, prior to Coronavirus, has been like dealing with a drug addicted relative.

The UX I great, and the development teams built a fast, pixel perfect, stable application. \n\nI do have a feature request: could you enable geofencing using the mobile application to automatically arm the system when I’m a certain distance away from my home? The technology is available, you guys just haven’t implemented it yet (at least with my setup). Arlo cameras and base unit do a great job of this. With Arlo, I can set the cameras to arm using a user defined distance from my home. When I pass the geofence, the cameras arm and start recording and alert me to motions detected. Having this feature would provide so much value to your customer base. It would keep users from having to manually arm/disarm the system and would increase security from forgetting to arm the system when away. It would really increase customer satisfaction and would put Xfinity far ahead of other competitors.\n\nKeep up the good work!","updated":"2019-05-11T22:35:11-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=418965252&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"6506901752","userName":"M0therofP00dles","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id924452201","version":"11.36.0","score":5,"title":"Great Security System!!!","text":"When I bought my house 11 years ago, it came with a security system that was installed by a fly-by-night company that was not even properly registered with the city where I live and that would randomly go off for no reason.

Fast forward- Xfinity came to my new apartment to install the alarm system I had to keep for another year at the time (per the original contract). When signing the form at the time of service for the installation at the new address, I stated in writing that I did not want to be entered into a new contract. The Xfinity employee told me I would not. Unfortunately, I was entered into a new 2 year contract for a home that most certainly does not require an alarm. I have about 6 months left of the contract, Xfinity will not let me opt out unless I pay a $300+ fee, and now the useless alarm system is sitting in a drawer and half of the sensor batteries died.
