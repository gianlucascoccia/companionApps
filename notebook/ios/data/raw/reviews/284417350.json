Album covers and artist names under songs are a plus, esp. when you have different songs with the same titles (I don't know why Apple hasn't done that yet for the iPod Touch's regular music app).\r\rA couple of things they should add (not complaining) are the ability to launch iTunes through the remote, a cover flow view and the ability to listen to your computer's iTunes on your iPod via headphones.","updated":"2008-08-01T05:02:47-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284417350&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"68059344","userName":"jjcmontana","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id28988171","version":"0","score":3,"title":"COMPLETE instructions would have been helpful, apple, sheesh!","text":"Where oh where to enter the passcode?!?

I personally found that the mDNSResponder system service was not active. Now what I ended up doing was turning off my G4. Once it was completely off, I turned it back on while holding down the shift key on my keyboard. What that did was force a \"refresh\" on the running services that goes on on your Mac. Once it starts up it will say safe mode under the Mac OSX words. Just log in and you should be prompted to allow a system service called mDNSResponder to run. Click allow and now you should restart your computer to get out of safe mode and all should be well with this app and many others. This takes a little while to perform but if you do this correctly you will save yourself hours of headaches.

The Apple Remote app could only respond with \"Home Sharing Must Be Enabled\".  After numerous reboots and reloads on my appleTV, router and iPhone, I reverted to the ethernet connection and THE PROBLEM VANISHED.  The problem is probably within the wireless network config side of the AppleTV.  And the Apple Remote programmers are probably scratching their heads.  With the Apple TV on wireless, the wireless remote app has significant problems connecting.  With the Apple TV on Ethernet all is well and the remote app works like a charm.  If your router is a jumper cable away from the AppleTV, try connecting the AppleTV to the router directly and see if your remote app problems go away.

The problem arises when one person pauses their songs for someone else to play something. There is an error message that appears saying that the remote speakers are already in use by another user. Now I realize that this error message might appear every now and then, but the problem I have is that the error message only appears on the computer screen and not on the iPhone. So then we are left to wonder why our song isn't playing, only to have to go into our room where the desktop is set up in order to dismiss the error message and get on with playing the song.\r\rI believe in order for this application to really advance further than it already has, the error message needs to appear on the iPhone itself so you can dismiss it without having to go into another room in order to play a song to airtunes.","updated":"2009-06-20T22:28:45-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284417350&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"6122349","userName":"magellan-tech","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id38555018","version":"0","score":5,"title":"FANTASTIC!!!!! best app in the store","text":"This is by far the best iphone app I have used.

There is no latency in using search or volume control and the display of songs, playlists, and album art is simply icing on the cake.

This app rescued me, I don't have to buy a new remote! After losing my Apple remote, I wasn't able to use my Apple TV at all, until I found this app. At first I thought it would be too challenging for this 61-year-old tech naïve lady to learn how to use. I just followed my nose, so to speak, and within three minutes, I was watching Netflix via my Apple TV. I didn't know how to make the app work, don't know anything about home sharing computers et cetera. What I did was to view some photos on AirPlay, which started up the Apple TV. On my iPhone, I'd started the Netflix app and the show that I wanted to watch. When I closed the camera roll, the show that I wanted to watch was on screen. And then it asked me to turn on home sharing in the app, which I did, and the controls magically appeared on my iPhone. It's very simple to use, and it's one of Apple's best apps ever. I even like it better than the actual remote itself, because I have mobility problems and it's easier to use the app on my iPhone than it is to hold or manipulate the buttons on the actual remote. Love love love this app.","updated":"2012-12-28T23:19:38-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284417350&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1494751663","userName":"Speed of Light","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id42636685","version":"4.3","score":5,"title":"iTunes remote is rock-solid when used correctly","text":"I routinely use iTunes playlists to entertain crowds of people between sets of live music.  iTunes is under-rated and very powerful database of music.

Here's what you need to know to make this app work: (1) Update all operating systems on your computer and iPads and iPhones, etc. — If you don’t, all bets are off, and results will be unpredictable. (2) Keep iTunes well organized on your computer — All music files need to be in the proper folder for iTunes to manage them correctly. Manage iTunes on your computer, not on your iPad!  (3) Use an Apple Airport Extreme to create a dedicated network — Do not use the Apple Airport Express or any other wireless router for this purpose, (4) Use an iPad connected to this dedicated network to control iTunes on your computer.
