I have two Pulse 3 speakers and it is almost impossible to get them working in stereo mode.  There is nothing about setting this up in the printed manual that comes with the speakers so I assume it is limited to setup via the app.  Also I can sometimes get one of the speakers set up to adjust the display but never so that I can adjust the other without without disconnecting both from Bluetooth first.

Nothing works if both are paired and connectedüôÅ. \n\nThe app often thinks another copy of the app is running on a different device, even when no other devices are present. \n\nUnnecessary requests for confirmation from the app, are tedious, the infamous ‚Äògot it‚Äô button. The app does have difficulty connecting many times when trying to use a speaker not paired as a stereo speaker or party speaker. It will tell you to bring the device closer to the speaker when it is literally less than 2 inches away. I am not sure why the connectivity issues are so ubiquitous. I am sure that there is more that can be done within the Bluetooth protocol API to make use of these friendlier. The user interface of the app is really atrocious. It would be nice for the app to honor dark mode option of iOS. But there is so much more wrong than that I hardly know where to start.  It would be great if they would add a feature that would allow you to use a previous configuration with one tap on the button, and to try over and over again behind the scenes to set things up that way, letting you know it‚Äôs trying, rather than forcing the user to try over and over and over again until it finally works, which it will, but it takes a frustrating amount of time frequently. This should be done by the processor not the user. When the music is paused, no matter how briefly, the speaker controlled by the app (not paired) to be in stereo mode will not play music for 10 to 15 seconds. You will get only one channel being played until it sort of wakes up again and realizes it should be acting as the left/ right channel. It would be great to have a persistent configuration option. So that when the speakers are both turned on they automatically go to a stereo configuration, in my case I would ask for the blue speaker to always be the right channel and the teal speaker to always be the left channel and not to have to mess with it every single time I turn them on.  The application really needs to have some semblance of state and to try to work out the connectivity issues on its own before bothering the user. That it assumes another app is involved when there is no such thing happening it‚Äôs quite frustrating. \n\n‚ÄúCurrently Unavailable\n\nClose the app on the other phones and move closer‚Äù","updated":"2021-06-04T17:25:37-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=994041762&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"7970479885","userName":"aTrandSmVince","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1143367333","version":"5.4.12","score":5,"title":"JBL Flip 5","text":"TransAmVince","updated":"2021-10-30T08:26:54-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=994041762&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"7498387614","userName":"Don_1994","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id363063810","version":"5.2.2","score":1,"title":"Trash","text":"I got one word ‚Äútrash‚Äù‚Ä¶","updated":"2021-06-23T14:15:56-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=994041762&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"7802209915","userName":"see dis this","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1185337632","version":"5.3.8","score":5,"title":"JBL Wireless","text":"Speakers are fire","updated":"2021-09-13T07:56:30-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=994041762&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"7384018551","userName":"ndurndiskne","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id473043833","version":"5.1.6","score":1,"title":"THE APP NEEDS IMMEDIATE ATTENTION!!!","text":"THIS APP IS JUST AWFUL NOT EVER WORKING AND I'M A BIG FAN OF JBL AND HARMAN I LOVE MY SPEAKERS BUT PLEASE INVEST MORE MONEY INTO THE APPLICATION, PLEASE! 2.0 STARS SHOULD ALREADY HAVE TOLD YOU GUYS THAT I CAN'T EVEN UPDATE MY SPEAKER PROPERLY","updated":"2021-05-24T14:48:02-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=994041762&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"7486446945","userName":"the king 2021","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id911296980","version":"5.1.6","score":1,"title":"Iraq","text":"Very very very bad","updated":"2021-06-20T08:38:18-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=994041762&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"7048931163","userName":"Special Review","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id428813036","version":"5.1.5","score":1,"title":"No Connection To JBL Clip 3","text":"Useless.","updated":"2021-02-28T05:50:38-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=994041762&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"7692758107","userName":"tribe47","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id484936618","version":"5.2.2","score":5,"title":"Kool","text":"Kool","updated":"2021-08-14T10:50:03-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=994041762&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1561024077","userName":"DevastatingChow","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id448272924","version":"2.0","score":4,"title":"Ignore all Previous Comments","text":"With the new Pulse 2 update, I now have access to the equalizer and waves mode, along with better audio quality.

The first step was to update the software on both of them (one at a time) using this app and connecting the speaker to a power source. When paired with each other using this app it worked well enough (it even differentiated the speakers based on their actual color), though any kind of volume change would cause one speaker to cut in and out for 10 to 20 seconds until it \"caught up.\" I'm not sure if this is because the phone is connected to only one of the speakers and then that speaker is connected to the other speaker, or perhaps it could also be the phone is connected to both speakers at once and the bluetooth signal isn't quite strong enough. Either way, there is a lag time for any volume inputs that *would* be slightly annoying in a party setting. Once \"caught up\" though, it worked well. It seemed the max distance for the phone from the speakers was cut way down when paired with both. I would recommend having the phone somewhere between them.
