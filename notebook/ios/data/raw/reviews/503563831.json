This app, which controls the AirPatrol unit increased functionality as far as settings on the heating unit compared to my old system. It seems responsive, fast and stable. I have not experienced any loss of connection so far (only a week).","updated":"2019-02-12T00:50:18-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=503563831&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"4573709072","userName":"Original Monkey Business","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id474165061","version":"4.0.4","score":5,"title":"Does a good job, with a task that is not all that simple!","text":"There are a lot of air-conditioners out there, mini splits, window units, and portables just to name a few.\n\nIt’s no small chore to have so many configurations preconfigured for you, which enables them to provide an interface that is both useful and pleasant to work with.\n\nThe portable unit I am using was just released, and I was fearful that I would not find a template that work with it. But after if an email or two to their customer support, I was up and running and could not be more pleased.\n\nTheir approach to this complex problem is a unique one, and I appreciate the time and effort that must’ve gone into getting all of it ready for prime time.\n\nSo, kudos to this vendor, and many thanks for a job well done!","updated":"2019-08-05T09:50:54-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=503563831&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"2587571100","userName":"Techadopter","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id29570252","version":"3.3.2","score":1,"title":"Better than other solutions with room to improve","text":"One hiccup I've experienced with AirPatrol since installing in June is they tend to randomly get confused, lose their connection to wifi and/or fail to communicate from my iphone to the AC units.  It's not clear if this is a server issue tied to AirPatrol or if I'm having wifi issues in my house.  Everything else on my wifi appears to be working when I have this issue.","updated":"2018-05-23T19:20:42-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=503563831&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"6929213149","userName":"sopo299","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id17252762","version":"4.2.1","score":1,"title":"New version doesn’t work","text":"Used old app for years to remotely control Misubishi mini-split and it work great.
