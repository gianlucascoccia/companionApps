I really like being able to get a real time view of my pet and my door.  It’s nice that I can change the sensitivity on the app, view them on my IPhone while I’m away, and save recordings.  \n\nThere are a couple of things I’d like fixed.  The more annoying issue is that the app has no support for daylight savings.  My recording times listed are 1 hour off from April to October. I made sure I have my correct time zone set for both cams.  The other issue may be the camera itself, even though both my cams have the latest firmware according to the app.  On my older camera, the app records every 3 minutes, even with no motion.  There are too many phantom recordings.  It is only supposed to record with motion.  I’ve already lowered the sensitivity so that sunlight in room doesn’t cause recording.  Also on this camera, it’s only supposed to be black & white, even though sometimes it records in color.  That is very strange.  Also, this camera seems to selectively record motion.  When I walk in front of the camera while it’s powered on, it should record me every time, but it doesn’t.  It may be the different firmware in the older Focus 66.  I never got clarification.","updated":"2019-06-01T10:15:31-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=796352577&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"6942872056","userName":"Chichi cheech","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id535316655","version":"6.1.66","score":5,"title":"Home Hospice Camera","text":"My mother-in-law has terminal cancer and we brought her home for hospice care.

The sound quality is amazing so if she wakes up and we are in another room we can hear her calling for someone. We just keep in plugged in and running at all times to amplify her voice as her speech is very limited and soft. Mom requires 24/7 care so at night who ever stays up with her can sit in the tv room to not disturb her and still see and hear her. Mom has a live-in boyfriend who cannot care for her as well as us so on his nights we can return home and b/c of the motion detection we can watch him with the phone application. This device has excellent video and sound quality and the motion and sound detection is so useful.

There is even a two way radio so you can speak & listen through the monitor. We also really like that you can play music from the monitor and it even reads the temperature in the room! Some things that could be improved are the movement feature & microphone system, as they are a bit delayed and show flashing symbols on the screen that make it seem like the app/camera is lagging.

They may upgrade the interface to make it look fancier but overall don’t do anything to fix the real issues.

I have ALL of the issues the other people have complained about. The worst part is I can’t see how to submit a Help ticket in the Hubble website. The app seems to close the minute it finally buffers to open quite often. The camera control is ridiculously slow. There is a few seconds delay. I have a 7 month old baby and to not be able to see her defeats the purpose of the app. There is obviously a major technological issue or bug.","updated":"2017-10-29T05:45:46-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=796352577&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"7336258351","userName":"jessiehoward","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id607519334","version":"6.1.74","score":5,"title":"I love my cameras","text":"I have 6 cameras and for the price you can’t beat it!
