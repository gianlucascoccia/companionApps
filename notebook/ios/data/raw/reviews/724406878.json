Finally have it working and your settings ready to go!? Well have fun when you lock your phone and go back into the app because it’s unsynced again... and just a helpful tip, don’t lock your phone while in the app, eventually you’ll have to restart your phone to even get it to work because it bugs out.... the quality of the speaker is what I expected with Sony but the app really ruins their reputation with me if I see “extra features in app”.

I have only been able to do the Music Party mode twice. I have had two SRS-XB30 speakers for over almost 2yrs now. The speakers themselves are amazing and I was about to purchase the larger XB40, but if they can’t get the Party Mode feature fixed, I may not. When the Party Mode worked, it was really cool and everyone I showed it to said they had never seen anything like it unless you wanted Sonos style speakers, but those aren’t easily portable. I have done all their troubleshooting and I haven’t got the Party Mode to work for over a year. I was trying to show it off again when we had people over for a patio party, but after an hour of trying, I gave up. It keeps saying my speakers need to be setup. At one point, even tho I only have two speakers, it showed I needed to setup 8 different SRS-XB30 speakers the app found... the reason I am writing this review today is I tried again to setup Party Mode bc we have family over and after 30 min of deleting the app, downloading it again, forgetting the speakers on my Bluetooth list, adding them back following the instructions in the app, I got 7 new speakers that needed to be setup along with the actual connection of the two speakers at the bottom of the app that were “grayed out”, I wasn’t able to select them. Again, the speakers are the best I have come across as for portability, ease of use, great sound, extra bass button, led lights that flash and change color (kids love this feature), water resistant and solidly built. Get the speakers but don’t download the app.","updated":"2018-06-23T09:25:17-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=724406878&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"3266514136","userName":"Nbtech72","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id295530991","version":"5.9.0","score":1,"title":"Crap","text":"Cant even use it becuase i cant agree to the terms of use","updated":"2018-10-05T06:04:48-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=724406878&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"3061037259","userName":"bhunt18","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id235359030","version":"5.9.0","score":1,"title":"Cannot agree to the terms and conditions","text":"PLEASE FIX THIS BUG.

Sony has taken a square peg and unsuccessfully attempted to jam it into their speakers. The app is so quirky it gives frustration a level you didn’t know existed. Sometimes it works  barely and then most times you spend 1 1/2 hrs trying to connect.  The app is extraordinarily slow and the user interface would even have Nasa engineers scratching their heads and wondering what Sony was thinking, or in this case not thinking.  The app needs a complete ground up Re-engineering. How could you possibly have a stereo mode for two Speakers and not be able to adjust the left/right balance. How basic a blunder that is. The App is so inept at connecting to its own speakers that you may be tempted to breakout your 3.5 mm stereo cord to connect. Don’t they test it before they put it out?? Clearly a rhetorical question. Had they done so we would not be trying to use what may be the worst app ever made. And if you have two speakers like I purchased, good luck figuring out which one is needing your device to be near it to register. They both display the same name Without any differentiation. Not that the app ever remembers that the speakers are registered anyway, and you wind up with a useless list of speakers that claim to need setup even though they had already been set up. Sony needs To get their proverbial act together and stop insulting new customers with an app that must be a product of new math. Make the app intuitive, user friendly and if you can’t do that, then at least make it automated. This app is useless and makes me want to return these great sounding speakers. I can’t even imagine the level of frustration if one were to try and connect with More then two. Well I no longer have to imagine. Purchased another two speakers. My head is about to  explode !!  I feel like throwing these speakers back to song and buying Bose. Just for the App. My frustration level with this app is off the charts. Sony you can do better and must do better to have customers even consider your Bluetooth speakers. Updates that don’t fix obvious use deficiencies are of no use. Go back to the design room and try to use engineering people who actually may test and use the product. Stop throwing garbage In Because this App is garbage out. Hope you can read this and take it back to the drawing board and redo this app. It’s a shame because the great speakers deserve a great App or at the least a useable one.  Looks like 4 speakers  are being returned. Spend less on propaganda and more on developing an App thstnsorkine","updated":"2018-11-23T23:56:52-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=724406878&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"3689322532","userName":"ltldmemeoxmekdkm","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id439007219","version":"5.11.0","score":1,"title":"App","text":"App crashes every time I go to zone 2","updated":"2019-01-24T07:07:55-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=724406878&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"2756285898","userName":"NLParrish","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id117838026","version":"5.8.0","score":1,"title":"Privacy Policy Bug","text":"Can’t accept the privacy policy to use the app.","updated":"2018-06-23T18:17:13-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=724406878&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"2441284542","userName":"erickgual33","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id609064573","version":"5.7.0","score":1,"title":"Update","text":"New update doesn’t let me pair my Sony zr5 speakers.

Any time any event occurs that caused a sound on your phone outside of the music or video being played, such as a text message, first you get that awful dip in volume that takes it way too far, and then BOOM! Now, for NO reason whatsoever, you are at maximum volume. \n\nThere is no possible justification for this.

The most frustration you can have in your lifetime. Connecting your speakers are challenging. It takes a long time of trying to get it on right. Not to mention the actual time it takes to connect. I wish they made some kind of improvement on their updates for this app. Using the speakers and not controlling them to set them up as a surround sound is completely pointless. If and when you actually connect your speakers...do not disconnect them as you will have to go through this all over again.","updated":"2016-08-11T13:52:06-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=724406878&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1496061310","userName":"elvyssjerry","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id283768207","version":"4.3.0","score":2,"title":"Wifi network option: \"no contents available\"","text":"The physical audio systems both work great independently of each other.
