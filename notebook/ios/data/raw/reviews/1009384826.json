It appears as if the scene data can somehow get corrupted between creating/modifying a scene, and then transmitting that scene data to be stored in the hub. \n\nThis issue was verified when Hunter-Douglas‚Äô superb support technician guided me to slightly change the scene data, causing it to be written out to the hub again. That solved my problem. \n\nAs an app developer it appears to be an initialization or corruption issue, which could be tracked down by embedding more data validation into the app. I might suggest the data be checksummed and the checksum be stored both in the app and on the hub. That way, any degradation of data could be automatically detected and perhaps the issue could be found and corrected. \n\nAll that said, the above issue is mostly a temporary frustration: the product has been a pleasure to work with, and now that HomeKit is supported, I can ask Siri to invoke any scene.","updated":"2019-06-10T16:56:43-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1009384826&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"7995762488","userName":"TwoDuhLou","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id49685767","version":"3.0.1","score":4,"title":"Great App, but poor iOS accessibility support","text":"I love this app. It is well thought out and helps me control my Hunter Douglas shades at my fingertips.

On paper, it sounds great. In use, the system isn't reliable. We added motorization to nine of the 19 window coverings. Half of the powered shades work reliably. The other half seem to have minds of their own. Sometimes they respond to the app. Sometimes they don't. It appears that some shades don't wake up from standby mode like they should.\n\nUsing the pebble remote will often (but not always) wake up a non-responsive shade and enable it to be controlled by the PowerView app. I've tried rebooting the hub and deleting shade memory but the results are hit and miss. I ended up deleting a couple shades to start over but they're still not reliable even after reprogramming. All PowerView-enabled shades are in the same room together with the hub. I added a repeater device but this doesn't help either.\n\nThe app shows signal strength and battery level for each shade. The obstinate shades sometimes show a green status, presumably indicating all is good, but at other times the battery level and signal strength icons are grayed out. Batteries are brand new in all shades--they were just installed.\n\nNest integration would be great if it worked reliably. When Nest determines no one is home, most of the shades move into the appropriate position, but there's always one or two that don't cooperate.\n\nSimilarly, because PowerView communications are unreliable with half the shades, the automation routines just cause eye-rolls when shades refuse to cooperate. Some stay open when they're supposed to close. Some stay closed when they're supposed to open. Hub reboots don't fix the problem, nor does deleting shade memory or removing shades completely. As mentioned earlier, using the pebble remote often jump starts the communication between the hub and shade and re-enables app control.\n\nWe chose Hunter Douglas because of the reputation for quality but PowerView automation still needs work.","updated":"2018-09-25T11:32:13-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1009384826&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"7924887506","userName":"The new user","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id16310192","version":"2.7.7","score":1,"title":"Limited services","text":"IN REMOTE CONNECTION\n\nCannot look at the contents of a scene and change it.\nCannot alter the automation programs.\n\nVERY POOR FOR THESE DAYS","updated":"2021-10-17T07:54:40-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1009384826&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1330617863","userName":"BergenGuy","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id200857277","version":"1.3.1","score":5,"title":"Straightforward and innovative","text":"Several weeks ago we had the motorized shades installed in 4 rooms of our house.

But it would be nice to say Alexa open shade 1. The silhouettes were expensive but worth it since are windows are 70 x 70. Nothing else would have worked because of the weight.

Coming home at night I expect all blinds to be closed but most of the times some are still open. In the morning not all of them open. Triggering the same schedule or scene again will complete the remaining actions. Removing and creating new scenes and schedules doesn't change a thing. It's very frustrating working with an app like this. The app also loses connection with the hub frequently while using it, even when you are only a few feet away from the hub, so it's not a strength of signal issue.

The app ask for which hub I want to connect to every time I open it (There is only one for your house). After I select the one and only hub it's a 50/50 shot it's going to connect. The scheduling worked for a little while and then stopped. My installer told me I might have to reinstall the app every once in a while or I'll have to go in to the app when it works and reconnect the shades to the hub when they aren't working. When I pay over $7,000 for shades in my house I expect them to work 95% of the time. I understand electrics need refreshing once in a while but not ever to this extent. The software part of the system is just junk. The whole reason I went with these was to use them with the Amazon Echo. However using that you need to use it with the IFTTT app. That fine and easy to setup but takes for ever to complete the action after you say the command. I heard all kinds of excuses from, \"weak internet\" which actually made me laugh out loud at them, to \"well it's having a hard time going through you walls\".  At that point they had repeaters that didn't really help either. Save you money and just hire someone to live with you to open and close your blinds.","updated":"2017-05-27T14:03:36-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1009384826&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1647835483","userName":"Maxie62209","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id330297258","version":"1.5.4","score":1,"title":"Inconsistent and frustrating","text":"This could be such a cool system but after spending $10,000.00 for nine of their top of the line blinds and months spent programming and reprogramming the app, I am disappointed and frustrated by my investment. \n\nI am lucky that I am computer literate because my dealer had no expertise in setting up the blinds and after three or four hours, I finally just told him to forget about it. \n\nAfter many hours over several days and two fruitless calls to customer service (all they did was read, word for word, the awful set up brochure), I finally got the blinds to somewhat do what I wanted. In fairness, their online PDF help file is much more informative but still hard to navigate. \n\nNow six months later, they still work correctly only about 75% of the time. Often at night one or two blinds will fail to close or in the morning one or two will fail to open. Using \"scenes\" will often result in erratic results as well. Unpredictable. \n\nWhen I am away from home (I travel a lot which was one of the reasons I bought these), I have no confidence that my blinds have closed properly and indeed often they don't. \n\nThis blind system came highly recommended and my expectations were high so when they fail to work I am left feeling screwed.","updated":"2017-06-17T09:22:58-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1009384826&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1334208035","userName":"Keypper","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id39310220","version":"1.3.9","score":1,"title":"Needs further development","text":"We ordered 11 shades with Powerview control some of which are mounted at heights we cannot reach so reliability is critical. Unfortunately control of the shades thru the Powerview app is intermittent. Using the scene option results in the hub losing track of the shade position in the majority of attempts to adjust the shades failing. Using the pebble instead of the app is even worse. The result is frequent resetting of the hub, scrambling to find a repeater that will talk to the shades, and trying each of our phones and iPads to regain control. Scheduled events have yet to operate. However, there is a lot of promise if they ever work out the bugs. Hopefully there will be an update to iron out the bugs.\n\nUpdate 2/16/16. Tried the app upgrade. Still can't find 10 of our 11 shades. So sad.","updated":"2016-02-16T21:51:45-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1009384826&type=Purple%20Software"}]
