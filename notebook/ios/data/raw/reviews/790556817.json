At first, sounded like a great investment, and it did worked for some time... but then a year ago the camera started to act weird.  I can’t view or access it through my T-Mobile service. I can ONLY view, access the camera via WiFi.  This happened a year ago and it was fixed.  BUT this week - out of nowhere - I can’t access my camera again through my phone unless I’m on WiFi. Seriously???! Again?!? Doesn’t it render this security camera useless while I’m on the go? Ugh.
