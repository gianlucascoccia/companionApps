Not a big deal if you wanted to just hard wire the phone to the speaker, but I want the phone to be playing on multiple speakers as I work in different areas (which requires the app).  Overall the concept is good (multiple wireless speakers playing different things or all the same thing), but the app is lacking a few things to consider.","updated":"2018-09-14T05:49:56-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=928625334&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"4987310563","userName":"Parcapy Reis","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id997095632","version":"2.5","score":1,"title":"This app","text":"This app is garbage it does not connect to my monster speaker.","updated":"2019-10-20T10:26:58-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=928625334&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1260783998","userName":"Eddiekaes1","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id223512892","version":"1.2","score":1,"title":"This App is the life blood","text":"The equipment must be run by this app to be effective. Sure you can hard wire your iPod, computer, or phone into one speaker but that's it. If you want to take advantage of the multiple speaker option, the app is necessary, and the app needs a lot of help. I am constantly restarting the app for it to find my speakers and yesterday had to delete the app and reinstall. This app is the life blood of the system and it is only a 1 star. The theory of it is a 4 star, (some things should be better, see above reviews), but currently it needs a lot of help.","updated":"2015-09-21T08:20:51-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=928625334&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1215857679","userName":"This app is extremely bad","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id287496930","version":"1.2","score":3,"title":"Few fixes and it'll be 5 stars","text":"Take away the limit for playlists.

The speakers are amazing, priced well. The app should already have all services, unless there is more to it than I know. No amazon music? bring any music or sound from our app to your speakers?  No control from mac or PC yet?  I feel Monster is going to miss the boat like Bose did with beats.  Get on it, I’m cheering for you. Sonos need some competition.","updated":"2016-01-08T16:22:37-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=928625334&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1485064127","userName":"DarbyTallyNike","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id42192905","version":"2.5","score":5,"title":"Love this speaker system","text":"Best sounding speakers I have ever heard, love how the app works with Spotify too","updated":"2016-11-15T09:14:42-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=928625334&type=Purple%20Software"}]
