It has taken several very lengthy, albeit very helpful, calls to get devices set up. Any company that provides phone tech support ranks high on my list.  My phone gets nonstop motion detection alerts because it even picks up changes in the light. So, perhaps a cloud coming by will set of the alert.  This caused more panic than it offset because, as a new home owner it felt as though someone must keep getting into the house when I'm out...otherwise, I attribute alerts to me walking around.  Now that I installed an SD card, I'll be able to review such activity. This is bringing me much more peace of mind, so I'm elevating my view.  Yet, I wonder is the 6-8 camera versions plus 2 terabyte hard drive aren't just a leap ahead...at least for a big house?  I haven't researched or compared yet because I had to hurry and get a freestanding camera once I closed, started moving in, but had to do a bit of travel.

Where‚Äôs the love?","text":"********\niPhone X users, switch to the mydlink app!\n********\n\nI‚Äôve seen this app get updated a few times since I bought my cameras (DCS-8000LH).  However, it still doesn‚Äôt support the screen size of the iPhone X.  In that very same time, Netflix has gone crazy with updates for the iPhone X.  It seems like every other week I get one.  If Netflix can do it, why can‚Äôt D-link?  Also, I agree with many others that the cameras need to capture a small low res picture of what is detected, and that needs to be in the notification sent to the phone.  Then, we can decide if we need to open the app and take more pictures or even record.  Because the cameras don‚Äôt store pictures or video themselves, or to the cloud directly, we‚Äôre at the mercy of the app‚Äôs ability to load in a timely fashion and to finally give us the ability to store them (and it‚Äôs only to the phone storage).  I get that these are budget cameras, and that they‚Äôre ‚Äúcost optimized‚Äù.  However, I‚Äôve been caught at the loading screen of the app while someone is entering into my residence.  In some cases they‚Äôre in and out before the app finishes loading.  This is why we need the cameras to at least take a low res picture when they detect something.  If it can‚Äôt be in the notification, then allow us to enter an email address that the cameras can send pictures to.  Then you don‚Äôt have to worry about storage concerns or cloud server overhead.  Surely the cameras can do that much?\n\nAlso, some complaints.....  because how can you fix a problem you don‚Äôt know about?\n\n1.  Your phone reps should never ask you for your password.  They are known to do this during troubleshooting.  I‚Äôve asked 2 of your reps about this and they claim it‚Äôs normal.  Furthermore, they state none of that is recorded in their notes, but yet I can hear typing over the phone.  Call me paranoid, but no company should ever ask for my password.  It just raises too many security concerns, but D-link should already know this right?  After all, your selling ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù cameras.  If you must access the account, reset the password and test.  Never ask.\n\n2.  These cameras don‚Äôt work consistently because of the cellular carriers.  Each time a cellular carrier does an update that blocks access to your cloud, we lose all functionality.  Your reps state this to be correct.\n\n3.  Why does your notification server go down so much?  If I can‚Äôt get stable notifications that my cameras have detected something, that makes them complete useless.  You need a failover solution.  I‚Äôve already seen this happen well over 5 times, and I‚Äôve only owned the cameras for a few months.\n\n4.  Why do I receive notifications when the cameras switch to night mode?  I don‚Äôt need to know when they switch to night mode.  I only need to know when they detect something.","updated":"2018-10-31T11:30:53-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=372571229&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"4340920960","userName":"STEFGIGDE","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id419517261","version":"3.8.13","score":5,"title":"Great","text":"It‚Äôs great.

I switch to a nearby wifi network and open the app, the image is stuck for a while before it realizes it needs to change its path making me click ok when the error message pops up and now waiting for it to load up the camera. This is especially bad when you get an alert telling you there's a motion detected and you want to quickly look and see what triggered it.
