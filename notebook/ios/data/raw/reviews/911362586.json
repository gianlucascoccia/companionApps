I bought a starter kit at the hardware store and downloaded the app.  After setting up the network, which was simple, and downloading a few firmware updates, everything worked flawlessly.  I've since purchased several more lights for the house.  I assume a recent update solved whatever bugs people were complaining about earlier.\n\nThe lights are wirelessly controlled from your phone with the app, and are dimmable.  You can also adjust the color temperature from soft white to daylight, 2700k-6500k, on bulbs which come with that option.\n\nThe app allows you to control lights individually, group lights by room, and set various scenes.  It enables you to set schedules and program vacation modes, but my favorite feature is the morning wake-up...it's hard to beat waking up to the lights in your bedroom slowly coming on over the course of 20 minutes.  I'll take that over a jarring alarm clock any day.  It also has sounds you can pair with this feature that are supposed to play from your phone, such as chirping birds, but I haven't gotten that to work yet.  If the program has a bug, this is the only one I've found so far.  I'd like to try it once it's fixed.\n\nMy only suggestion, aside from fixing the audible portion of the morning wake-up, would be to allow programming of scenes or somehow more intuitively set the ending color temperature and brightness level for the wake-up feature.\n\nBut overall a great start on what I think will be the future of home lighting, and I'm definitely grateful for the improved start to my day.","updated":"2016-06-27T08:53:52-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=911362586&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"2030417397","userName":"irishkid90","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id217808436","version":"1.9.1","score":1,"title":"Color Loop Does Not Work","text":"Color looping doesn‚Äôt work and there are no other apps to make it loop.

The entry light is in the ceiling, and I wanted to use the LED faux-can light replacement as a solid structure to cover the hole in the ceiling, so wasps and critters couldn‚Äôt get in there.\n\nThe problem with this is that conventional LED replacement lights for can fixtures are all very bright (65-watt equivalents) and usually 3000K or whiter light, and I wanted something about 25-watt equivalent and 2700K.  The Lightify system allowed me to tune my LED can light replacement to 20% brightness and 2700K and then keep it that way after I turned the power off and back on at the switch.\n\nIt worked fine for about a year, and then all of a sudden quit controlling the brightness, thus making a blinding 100% bright light come on every time I turned on the switch.  It did keep the 2700K setting.  I could still dim it to 20% with the app, but that was very bothersome.\n\nSo I emailed tech support, and Stephan responded quickly, saying that my light had not upgraded properly and thus couldn‚Äôt \"remember\" my custom dimmer setting as the default.  He said it would require my leaving the light on so that he could downgrade the light, thus allowing me to re-upgrade the app and light.\n\nIt took a while for us to coordinate on the fix (mostly my fault), since tech support is 6 hours earlier than my Eastern time zone in the US, but, once we finally got synced up, he performed the operation.\n\nI re-upgraded and set the 20% brightness/2700K settings as the default (in the \"device\" option at the bottom of the app‚Äîjust customize your settings, tap the light switch icon at the top right of the app, and follow the prompts to \"add\" the custom defaults).  Now it works again the way it always used to, so I‚Äôm very satisfied.\n\nObviously, the system shouldn‚Äôt have done this to begin with, so 4 stars not 5, but tech support really came through and went the extra mile to make it work.  Before you rate this product too low, check with tech support.  You may just need to get your lights reprogrammed from the source!","updated":"2018-03-06T09:35:05-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=911362586&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1605704388","userName":"Richiebee48","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id114741924","version":"1.8.0","score":1,"title":"Terrible","text":"I can't emphasize enough how awful this system is.

The smart-things hub was fine but I was disappointed because I could not find a way to use Alexa voice commands to change the colors of the bulbs. So I bought an Osram hub, hoping it would solve the problem, then I installed their app. Not only did it not solve the voice command-color control problem, but the controls are so confusing and awkward that I found the app extremely frustrating to use. I'm a person of average computer intelligence, and I cannot figure out how to accomplish what I want with the Osram app, versus the SmartThings app which I found to be extremely easy and user-friendly. The Osram App seems to offer no advantages over smart-things, and I don't see the point in having both so I will be sending their hub back and staying with smart-things which is much more versatile and can do much more than just control light bulbs. \n\nOsram loses another star due to their lack of email tech-support and non-searchability of their support forums.  And I deducted another star for their lack of IFTT support, which seems like it should be mandatory for any home automation product. Seems to me like their software and presentation isn't quite finished yet.  Good thing I got the bulbs on Black Friday sale, or I'd be sending those back too and exchanging for something that performs as promised\n\nAddendum: Jan 14, 2017. Lightify suddenly stopped working with Alexa voice control today. Attempts at troubleshooting only resulted in a \"API internal server error\".

It said that everything worked off Wi-Fi and was user-friendly.\n\nHere's what I found out. The lights are indeed easy to install. They work like any normal lightbulb. You screw them in you turn them on and off. Where this product miserably fails is the programming of the gateway and connection to the lights. \n\nLet's start with the app. The app itself is easy enough to download and the features are easy enough to figure out to program the lights and to connect them to the Wi-Fi. However the gateway has a tendency to continuously fail and sometimes cannot always connect to the lights.\n\nYou find that you have to, several times a week, reconnect the gateway to the Wi-Fi and even then it takes longer to then try to have the gateway find the lights again. My lights are not far away from the gateway. In fact the furthest away would be about 20 to 30 feet. I have the gateway set up exactly where I needed it, close to the front of the house to program the front lights. I even bought a Wi-Fi range extender to also put at the front of the house just in case that was an issue. However neither should've been an issue because the primary Wi-Fi in the house gives a strong signal everywhere.\n\nThe programing for these lights is poorly done. It cannot maintain connections to the wi-Fi or the lights and needs to always need to be reset.\n\nNow, here's the worst part. I've had them for a couple of months now and now the gate we won't even connect it all to the lights. Just simply won't find them. The light still turn on and off but either the gateway or the lights are now malfunctioning after just a few months of use.\n\nBottom line, I would suggest finding some other product out there because this one is a MAJOR FAIL.","updated":"2017-02-11T08:36:37-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=911362586&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1355217085","userName":"iDavidperalta","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id399991791","version":"1.5.0","score":1,"title":"Worst app ever","text":"It doesnt work at all","updated":"2016-03-28T21:48:35-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=911362586&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5549622181","userName":"CHEKO1971","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id269774159","version":"2.0.1","score":5,"title":"Muy bueno","text":"Muy bueno","updated":"2020-02-18T14:47:49-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=911362586&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1722329149","userName":"Jwillgoesfast","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id42454865","version":"1.9.0","score":2,"title":"Widget","text":"PLEASE PLEASE fix the widget configuration for iOS üôÉ","updated":"2017-08-10T19:26:55-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=911362586&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1613312362","userName":"BigTalkingBatteryDrainer","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id37440595","version":"1.8.0","score":1,"title":"App","text":"Poor app","updated":"2017-05-13T20:51:38-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=911362586&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1461715791","userName":"TOR.1","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id528403542","version":"1.7.1","score":1,"title":"None","text":"Yuck!","updated":"2016-10-05T17:08:48-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=911362586&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"3675688781","userName":"Ndhxizbs","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id117664308","version":"1.9.5","score":1,"title":"DOESNT WORK","text":"Horrible BOUGHT EXPENSIVE LIGHTS THAT DONT EVEN CONNECT!!!!!!","updated":"2019-01-20T17:45:09-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=911362586&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"8038738509","userName":"animal_bob","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id15092828","version":"4.1.0","score":5,"title":"One of the few","text":"One of a few of the maybe about 100 - 150 apps I've used that really has done what it's supposed to do every day.
