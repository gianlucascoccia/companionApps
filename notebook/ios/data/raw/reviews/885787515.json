We last year (May17) had a $30k plus state of the art Ductless Air/Heating system installed in our home. Of course we went for the “SMART HOME” app so we could work the system from our phones to run our home while we were away or to check on each individual unit in each room of our home since every room has its own unit and control. I was able to enable the app and got it working well and was happy with it for about six months until Samsung did their last app update in early 2018. After their update what ever they did it completely rendered the app useless!!!!!  I have downloaded and deleted this app for the last six months too many times to count. Finally (May 2018) I downloaded the app and it took me thru all the steps and told me the download was complete I was excited to finally get this back up and running. That excitement was so short lived (about 5 minutes) that I said a few choice words because the app kept kicking me back to sign in and would search search and search and them come back and show me I wasn’t connected to the system. Log in again and again and again and that’s as far as it has gotten. This being a “SMART” app had to have had a moron writing it and tried to pass it off as his brain child hoping they would think he/she was so smart!!  Apple why do you put this crappy app out there for  Samsung?  They defiantly don't belong there. When it did work I was really excited to show it off to every one as being cool to run you heat/ac system with out being home. This app is JUNK and needs to be rewritten and replaced!

It takes a good few minutes through several loading screens before I can control my vacuum. \n\nThe app is still very buggy. Every time I open it after it’s been a more than 30 seconds the app will start by giving me an error that it lost connection to my vacuum. It also will randomly fail to actually send a command or an updated setting to the vacuum. The pairing process to my account has to be repeated for every device you want to use this app in, which means in order for my wife and I to both have control of the vacuum from our phones I had to restart the WiFi connection process each time. Then the app forgot both our phones so we had to do it again about two months later. \n\nIt constantly fails to send me notifications. So for example if the vacuum gets stuck or lost it is supposed to tell me so I can go find it and save it. However it often fails to do that so I don’t know it failed till I come home and see the vacuum isn’t back at its charger. \n\nIt has a remote function where I can manually tell the vacuum what to do but the lag between cell Phone to vacuum is so bad that it is utterly useless. \n\nThis app and product (my robot vacuum) is the only time that I can think of where using the IR remote to control it is the far preferred experience to using the app. There is nothing useful you can do with this app that you cannot do with the remote with the only exception being turning on the vacuum from another room or outside of the house. All the other functions just don’t work or Work so poorly that you won’t use them. \n\nLuckily the vacuum itself is actually pretty great. Just put it on a daily schedule and empty the bin every day and forget about it. It doesn’t get stuck very often once it learns your house.

I have purchased their TV’s, refrigerators, microwaves, washers, dryers, etc for YEARS and have had great success with the products and with Samsung customer service. But this app is so bad I cannot believe they even put their name on it!!!  If this is the only way to make Samsung “Smart” products smart - then this is FALSE ADVERTISING!!! \n\nI purchased the Samsung Smart washer and was very excited to have my “Smart” washer actually tell me when it was done with the wash cycle!  I have a bad habit of forgetting the clothes are in there. But the Smart home feature was hugely disappointing!!! It took me MONTHS to get the washer and the app to connect with each other. Partly because the instructions that came with the washer directed me to a different app that apparently is no longer maintained.  Once I got the correct app and was able to follow the horrible instructions correctly I finally got them to connect. \n\nThen imagine my disappointment when I realized that I have to turn on “Smart Control” every time I put a load in the wash. Once you select “Smart Control”, the washer locks and you can’t do anything from the washer - it must all be done from the app!  That’s fine except for when you missed a shirt and you need to add it to the wash. The app says there is an add clothes feature, but trust me, you cannot add anything!! It does not work! The washer is locked. \n\nThen the app does not actually tell me when the wash is done as I have to reconnect with the washer every time I open the app.  Perhaps it would tell me if I left the app open on my phone for the hour and 15 minutes that the cycle is going - but really??  Who is going to do that? When the washer is done and I am able to connect back to the app it actually just says “disconnected”.  No notification or message sent. There is a badge on the app, but that shows up a very long time after the wash is done.  So what is the point? I can’t tell it I want to rinse the clothes again or anything! I really thought once I got the washer to connect with the app all would be great. But the app is just completely lame. Why does it have to reconnect every single time I open it? Why does it tell me that my washer must be unplugged or my WiFi must be down? It connects again within 2 minutes but really? Every time? I don’t think this is very smart. I thought maybe it would work better once I connected it to Alexa, but I have yet to get Alexa to be able to discover my washer!! (Even though they are supposed to be compatible). She has every Samsung skill there is, and they are both connected to the same WiFi, but as hard as I try, I cannot get them to connect. \n\nSo if you want a smart home - I recommend that you don’t use Samsung Smarthome. They make great appliances but not smart ones.","updated":"2018-07-26T14:51:47-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=885787515&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"2582009003","userName":"031749","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id330807377","version":"3.1194.933","score":1,"title":"Horrible","text":"Bad software robot vacuum good","updated":"2018-05-22T10:21:42-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=885787515&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"3113539522","userName":"SW120416","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id240732386","version":"3.1194.938","score":1,"title":"Samsung Appliance smart features not worth the money.","text":"For background, I’m a huge Samsung fan. I use SmartThings for Home Automation, even though some aspects and features are frustrating. I just purchased a 65” Q9, which is probably the greatest TV ever created. \n\nWhile Samsung, in my opinion, makes great products, they’re attempts and making them useful in home automation leaves a LOT to be desired. Especially coming from an innovative technology company. \n\nI just got a $1,200 Samsung smart dishwasher. The dishwasher itself is fantastic. The smart features will leave you disappointed.  \n\nFirst off, it’s not available in SmartThings, so I was forced to use the Samsung Smart Home App, which was probably designed by Middle School interns to keep the cost down. It’s pretty obvious that Samsung invests very little development dollars into the app when several of the areas you go into have the crappy looking text of iPhone apps from 5 years ago. Add to that the utter annoyance that you have to keep logging into the app and putting in the security letter/Number combo that auto-generates, and you have a frustrating experience in the making. \n\nAfter I finally got the dishwasher connected via WiFi to the app, I then had to go to an online forum to understand why Smart Control wouldn’t stay on. (FYI, you have to hit the button and then close the door). \n\nSo, here is a synopsis of the Samsung Smart Home Appliance experience:\n\n1. Crappy App\n2. Not compatible with SmartThings, which is supposed to be their SmartHome platform of the future. \n3. In order to control an appliance, you actually have to turn the appliance on and hit the smart connect button, which begs the question, if I have to walk up to it anyway, then why would I use the app?\n4. If you turn your dishwasher off, it disconnects. \n\nIn summary, LOVE Samsung appliances. They should probably try to hire some people from Apple to completely revamp their Smart Home division and actually make it technically match the companies other qualities.","updated":"2018-08-25T12:17:10-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=885787515&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"2946030106","userName":"chuck hates samsung app","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id512547760","version":"3.1194.938","score":1,"title":"Total garbage","text":"Good luck this app is complete garbage,","updated":"2018-07-21T14:04:20-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=885787515&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"2957554198","userName":"Tomelis77","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id301078888","version":"3.1194.938","score":1,"title":"Stupid Samsung company","text":"I hate Samsung","updated":"2018-07-23T17:12:36-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=885787515&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"6666651697","userName":"Seanaaden","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id326744710","version":"3.1194.960","score":1,"title":"Saddest app","text":"Useless app","updated":"2020-11-20T08:08:38-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=885787515&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"2811906446","userName":"RLS1","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id22689194","version":"3.1194.938","score":1,"title":"No support for Samsung TVs","text":"Samsung smart TVs are not supported","updated":"2018-07-01T05:25:31-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=885787515&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5335978000","userName":"Sportygynts","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id190300642","version":"3.1194.944","score":1,"title":"IT US NO GOOD GET BETTER TECHS","text":"I HAVE TWINS WASHER AND DRYER THE APP DOES NOT WORK DO BETTER OR GO HOME","updated":"2019-12-29T12:43:57-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=885787515&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"2988341975","userName":"Anthony Baklayan","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id16210366","version":"3.1194.938","score":1,"title":"No","text":"<eof>","updated":"2018-07-29T11:19:17-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=885787515&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1696162906","userName":"cheetopet","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id357252777","version":"3.1189.910","score":1,"title":"Save yourself!!!!","text":"I'm sad I can not give this zero stars, which is unfortunate as the aircon hardware is quite lovely.
