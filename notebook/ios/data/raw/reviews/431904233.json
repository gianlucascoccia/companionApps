Scrolling thru the menus showed it had WiFi capability. Cool I thought! I was at first disappointed to find out it only works with a Nexia hub or app, which I had never heard of before. So I installed the app on my iPhone and created an account. Then it came time to get the app and the thermostat to talk to each other. The good news it’s the app takes you step by step thru the process. For security reasons I recommend configuring your router to have a guest WiFi separate (lan access blocked) from your main WiFi and tell the thermostat (via the app) to use the guest WiFi. Once everything is configured, the app talks to the “cloud” and then the “cloud” talks to the thermostat and the thermostat reports back what it’s doing. The thermostat can be fully controlled from anywhere there is an internet connection.\n\nHowever, I have not been able to get Alexa to work with the Nexia app. The Alexa skill for Nexia is enabled but Alexa says it can’t find the thermostat.","updated":"2021-09-16T20:41:54-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=431904233&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"6151956536","userName":"WFH Wife","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id226559158","version":"5.10.0","score":5,"title":"5 stars but do have a strong recommendation for the app developer","text":"Suggestion for app developer: I do love the majority of the features over my former thermostat with an app, but there is one feature that I already sorely miss. This would be the ability to manually adjust the temperature different from the schedule running but with a system end time versus running at that temp until the next schedule period which could be hours later. An example for you would be doing vigorous housecleaning that causes a person to get hot such as mopping, dusting and vacuuming where I would previously set the temp for cooler for about an hour duration and then it would automatically revert back to the scheduled temperature at the end of that hour. I have to remember to go back and set back to Run Schedule when done or realize I didn’t when I get too cold when the work is done.

Most of the time it does not work and you can only make changes using a mobile device or computer. Their is no way to do a temporary hold for a set time such as when you have a party with lots of people the way Honeywell units work.

I think that’s the only way to get the app working up to the level of what you paid for your “smart device”.\n\nAs some others have mentioned, this is not nearly as functional as the app for a Nest or EcoBee.  Those dedicated apps are focused on a single product, whereas the Nexia app is scattershot across a diverse line of products.  The only commonality between the products is the technology employed to allow it to communicate.  Therefore the app lacks focus and control for an advanced item, such as a Trane thermostat.\n\nOn the positive side, it does the very basics - change temperature, set schedules, etc.  But for what we paid for the thermostat (or insert your Z-Wave device here), I would expect the app to closely match the presentation and functionality of the thermostat.  Go to your Account on Nexia’s website, and you will see a nice colorful display that resembles what you see on the thermostat.  It doesn’t fully replicate to actual unit, but it comes closer than the app, and is easier on the eyes.\n\nThe unit is “smart”.  There are tons of information available on the unit that can be accessed online - why is it not available for the user/owner?

Because nowhere does it say that two people trying to use the app to access the same thermostat must use the same account! It simply tells you to sign up for an account and take these steps! But halfway through, OUR thermostat showed something entirely different. After trying to find an answer over a 4 day period, I emailed them. I got a prompt reply telling me that I had to sign in with my husband's account!\n\nI've just spent another hour trying (unsuccessfully) to set up a schedule!

But when I adjust Saturday it offers to apply the setting to M-F but not Sunday!

But, just stopped working....","text":"I have used the Nexia system and app for years. The Alerts feature was one of the most useful features for us. However, that feature quit working completely, including the disappearance of all alerts history. When I accessed the app to determine why I wasn’t receiving alerts anymore, there was a message indicating there were no alerts set for our home and instructions to click the settings button above to set up alerts. When I clicked the settings button, it showed at least 10 different settings that were set up. Despite them being set up already, I hit Save and was returned to the Alerts screen where I was advised, once again, there were no alerts set up for our home. \n\nContact with Support via email provided no help. 2 days after sending my email requesting assistance, I received an email advising me to call them during specific hours and days. So I call during a specified time and day, negotiate the automated system prompts, finally reach a Support person, and am told to delete and re-add, then reactivate, my phone in the Nexia system. This not only doesn’t fix the issue, but now Alerts are not even available among my dashboard menu.....  So, I am advised to delete and reinstall the app completely on my phone. Same result, not fixed and Alerts no longer visible at all. \nSupport then advises they need to escalate the issue, they will have to email their support (that’s right, Support’s Support person), but nobody is there at that time to provide them an answer. Why would you instruct your customer to call during a time when ALL levels of support are not available to actually solve a problem???\nSo, after a half hour of wasted time with “Support”, I’m no better than before and Alerts aren’t even visible anymore. \nAnd I pay an annual fee for this.....??  Probably not much longer....\nThere are better systems out there now.

Adding HomeKit would really differentiate because TRANE would have the only variable heat pumps with HomeKit compatibility. Apple users want this. \n- Publish an API to the Nexia site so that developers can more easily integrate hubs with Nexia. SmartThings, Control4, Savant, Crestron, Harmony, SimpleControl, etc. Nexia only benefits from partnering.","updated":"2018-04-17T08:05:19-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=431904233&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1842661524","userName":"the_hobbit","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id101796875","version":"4.19.0","score":1,"title":"Worst App Ever!!!","text":"Wish you could select zero stars! It is sad that you spend so much on an American Standard AC system and are forced to use this app with their custom thermostat. At least 80% of the time the app shows disconnected yet when I go upstairs the thermostat says connected to the internet. And it the app is connected it takes 5-6 times of changing the temperature for it to actually take. Sometimes I give up and just go upstairs and change it manually.  American Standard should partner with Nest, their app puts Nexia to absolute shame! I wish there was another app that worked with these thermostats!","updated":"2017-10-11T17:57:47-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=431904233&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1170548032","userName":"Leo.R.Castillo","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id32680143","version":"4.3.0","score":1,"title":"Please don't sign up for Nexia service","text":"I am trying to save you and your household a lot of hassle. Nexia's service is not worth even the $10 or so dollars they charge every month. Their app NEVER communicates properly with front door lock devices and almost always requires logging into a computer to do basic and simple tasks like setting user codes and such. They are not somewhere you want to go for home automation or any of their other services. Their customer service is terribly shoddy and I am so frustrated right now that I feel I owe it to the next person to save you the headache.","updated":"2015-03-19T21:51:52-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=431904233&type=Purple%20Software"}]
