Each new update doesn’t make it easier or better to use. Shame, because their actual hardware products are really next gen stuff (OLED/ATMOS SJ9/ etc.) It’s just too bad their software hails from sometime in the early 2000s. LG seriously have to look into improving little-big details like this. Perhaps changing the whole linking of speakers to a new system is the way to go about it, because after having use this over a year, I’ve had to always meddle with it with an average of twice a week. Please LG, please, don’t let simple things like this make you lose customers and hurt your reputation and brand.","updated":"2017-11-09T08:06:41-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=896940447&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5396189335","userName":"Jdkfjsnsjfjdnalfksbsjfnf","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id12455710","version":"1.9.86","score":1,"title":"Somehow, getting worse","text":"Let’s ignore the fact that LG decided to throw in the towel right after we bought our speakers - business decisions like that happen.

You have to have this app to connect them together. The app is clunky, often doesn't find the satellite speakers, and I spend more time trying to get it to link them or play music than it is worth. I expected so much more from LG. This is a huge disappointment. I should have just waited for the Apple speakers because I know they would have worked as intended. Right now I linked the satellite speakers and it shows they are successfully linked but no sound comes out. \n\nDO NOT MUSIC FLOW\n\nUPDATED REVIEW:  I recently updated the app because it said it was required (Nov 2017) and now my wireless rear speakers won’t connect to the app at all.  Every time they do an update it makes things worse. I am $800 into a sound system that DOESNT WORK!  I just want my money back at this point.\n\nUPDATE 7/2018:  One of the new updates has allowed the app to find satellite speakers but no sound comes out at all. I have to literally unplug the satellite speakers from sound every time I want to use them. I would rate zero stars if possible.
