I have never seen a such  poor performance in all this time working  with apps and cameras. A camera is totally useless with out the app or software to drive it. This app needs to be deleted from App Store it is a total disaster.\nI had played with all setting on the app to compensate I try to copy all the setting from my first camera to this new one and the zoom and focus are deplorable and at night are even worst!! I can not take pictures at all it is very blurry because of the focus that the app controls. This app needs more improvement! FOSCAM is constantly bombarding the screen with their useless cloud service every time that I try to access the camera using  this app is unavailable it takes for ever to load. You get the spinning loading wheel for ever. If you have a memory card installed and you set up the app  to constantly record 24/7 and you want to download a portion of the recorded clip there is no way to just get the small portion that you are interested on because there is no option in this app to download from the camera to your device that you are using to monitor the recording. This app is poorly written needs many improvements the sliders that the app has to allow you to move forward or backwards when viewing the recorded clip do not respond accurately and if you want to see a clip recorded on the memory card you can not download it to you computer this features are only available if you buy their cloud services basically forcing you to buy their services. \nThis app should be able to download and record any clip from your camera from your SD card installed in the camera to any device that you are using to control the camera but it does not do that. \nThis app is designed to force you to buy their services.\nSummarizing. Whenever I use this app I can not control the camera. I am not sure if the app Is not controlling the camera because and night all the pictures are blurry and again. A camera with out an app that can controls the camera  is useless and this seem to be case. I am very disappointment.","updated":"2020-07-02T07:24:11-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=924381688&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"4931323296","userName":"Kyle12313","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id140642533","version":"2.3.2","score":1,"title":"Won’t connect","text":"Used focam products for years and they won’t connect in the app. Disappointing","updated":"2019-10-12T07:38:53-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=924381688&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"4538811885","userName":"ten75k","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id118792228","version":"2.2.10","score":2,"title":"Get an arlo","text":"Works almost.
