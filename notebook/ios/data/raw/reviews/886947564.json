I have done all of this.  The issue is after signing into the app and letting it run in the background, the app for no apparent reason signs out and then I have to enter my password again to sign in.

I just setup 3 mini plusses, 1 mini O and a Vault.  From the mixed reviews I read, I believe the success of the cameras largely depends on one's existing wireless network. \n\nI have an Orbi network that broadcasts both 5 and 2.4 on the same SSID. I expected this to be an issue though it wasn't. Each camera connected to the network and was working in the app within 1 minute. I formatted the SD card, updated firmware and configured the settings for each camera in well under 10 minutes (each.) \n\nI think the software is great. Sure, there are a couple of enhancements I will request but so far, it's been solid and very functional. I don't use the cloud clips so I ignore that but I haven't found that to be intrusive.  \n\nThe cameras records to local SD card and send to cloud only when a camera senses motion though each camera sends to the vault continually. I didn't expect this and found it to be a nice surprise. The app differentiates between continual stream and motion alerts so it's quick and easy to find activity. It's also very simple to export snapshots and clips. \n\nIf they asked me where to improve, I don't believe anything is well documented so I'm still trying to figure out how a few features work.","updated":"2017-06-05T11:51:39-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=886947564&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1706513410","userName":"Firstborn1980","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id49441780","version":"3.3.1","score":2,"title":"It Works But...","text":"Like the title says it works but it's lacking in a couple places. This is not a convenient app. My 2 big issues is that there is no easy way to put the camera to sleep from my phone and there's no Apple Watch app. \n\nFirst sleep mode - when arriving home I have to open the app, go into settings, then put the camera to sleep. When I don't do this I get a bunch of notifications from the motion sensor. Most times my hands aren't free when I get home so I have to put my things down and clear the notifications , then I can put the camera on sleep mode. There needs to be an easier way like a widget to toggle sleep mode on/off. \n\nSecond Apple Watch app - my phone isn't always next to me but my Watch is always on my wrist. If the camera detects motion and I'm not right there next to my phone (or even looking at it) how will I know that someone is in my place? If I were able to receive the notification on my wrist I would know immediately that there may be an issue. \n\nJust a couple ways I think the app could be greatly improved but it does what it's supposed to do and the picture is pretty good.

There are too many false motion triggers from areas of the video screen where repetitive motion occurs (like a road or spinning ceiling fan).\n\n2) Make the ability to DELETE all motion events, not just mark them as read. Scrolling through hundreds of motion triggers 15 at a time takes a long time. \n\n3) On the playback timeline, instead of just a blue timeline, change the color wherever motion was detected. This way, if you need to lookup when something happened, it will be easier to find knowing the parts of the timeline where motion occurred.","updated":"2017-03-08T08:00:36-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=886947564&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1756530184","userName":"A Commoner","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id34659610","version":"3.3.1","score":5,"title":"Stellar app","text":"I've used several of these apps and find this one to be very slick because of the simple scrub back in time on any camera.
