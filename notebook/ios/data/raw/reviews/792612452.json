User error? \nWe have really enjoyed our new thermostat and this app, installed about 4 years ago. Updates have been good. We've had no connectivity problems, and setting schedules and modifying is straigh simple. It can be set to adjust to outside temps too instead of just time of day. (You can set it to reach the temps you like AT the time you like knowing Sensi will actually turn furnace on sooner and full speed if its really cold out, and closer to the schedule time if it’s only cool out.)  I LOVE being able to control our furnace from bed - turning it  up early if I wake early, or down if we want to sleep in later than usual. We have even used it from the airport to be sure we returned to a toasty house. I thought our old programable thermostat was fine, but I would never go back now as this system allows much more flexibility for saving energy while you’re sleeping or at work, while still keeping you comfortable. A solid app. We have not tried the beta location app that adjusts temp down 3 degrees if your phone leaves, and turns on as you near home... we keep a pretty predictable schedule and just overuse that if it’s an odd day.","updated":"2017-11-04T05:25:30-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=792612452&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1827801210","userName":"androticus","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id12856019","version":"2.2.11","score":5,"title":"Went SO downhill!","text":"When I got my first Sensi about 1-1/2 yrs ago I was thrilled, especially with the app. Sadly, there's very little great in the tech world that psychopathic designers and programmers can't ruin.

Now, it first opens to a crippled small list view of \"all\" your thermostats--because most people have five or six right? </sarcasm> You can change temperature up or down on the dinky view, but have to press to then get the full screen version for things like on/off heat/cool or fan. I use the app a lot as a remote to change fan on/auto so now have to navigate every time to do this--so damned annoying. Also, it used to solidly accept control changes now those are super flaky and often don't stick.

Before this we had to replace one in less than a year and have some connectivity issues with another. But the issue I have now is two fold – where they source their weather data from us not accurate for my rural location, and currently Sensi settings are not flexible enough to allow us to change the source or add a local source (we have a lacrosse weather station) for weather temp data. This is essential for those of us with dual fuel heat pumps. We learned that Dark Sky (recently bought by Apple and claims to have the most accurate hyper local weather data lol) provides the weather data for these Sensis.  But from dusk to dawn they report my outdoor temp 8 degrees cooler than it really is, causing my heat pump to kick over to propane and unnecessarily burn fuel instead of the electric heat pump. Do that every day thru winter and the costs add up, making the dual fuel setup almost useless. We love our sensi’s but if they don’t either give us more flexibility / control to change data sources OR find a more accurate data provider, we will be going to Nest or some brand that provides the options we need.

The only issue I have was that when ordering my new thermostat, the Sensi was advertised as one of the few smart thermostats that “doesn’t need a c-wire” to replace older thermostats. This is a tad misleading. Although you don’t need a dedicated c-wire, your wire configuration has to be altered if you don’t have one. The installation walk-through on the app never addresses this. I installed per the app and furnace wouldn’t turn on. After an hour I luckily found a tutorial video on the app that showed how to use the “fan” wire as the c-wire. This worked, but you lose the ability to use the fan to circulate air. All in all, I love the thermostat and app, but wish the c-wire comparability would have been communicated better.
