We live in the Denver metro area where temperatures and weather conditions can vary greatly across the area. I can check the temperature outside my house and then look at the temps across the area. I can see how much colder it is in the mountains than on the plains or between where I live and Boulder (this is in the map portion of the app). If you swipe left in the app, you can see pollution levels (helpful if you like to exercise outdoors). I love how the device warns you when the CO2 level is too high in your house. I also like that I can see noise levels. The app will alert you to any hazardous weather conditions in your area if you turn on the alerts. We recently purchased and installed the wind and rain gauge. Hopefully, we will love them as well. I find Netatmo an extremely useful device.","updated":"2017-12-01T11:23:34-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=532538499&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5817010986","userName":"sarbs","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id42597125","version":"2.4.0","score":2,"title":"Notifications still not 100%","text":"Notifications appear again, for the most part.

It was in the low 80's yet they listed the \"Feels Like\" temperature at 117. The temperatures on all units are off by about 2-2.7 degrees. Still no way to initiate an immediate reading from the app. You must rely on old data or physically access the base station to request a reading. The additional units lack in functionality. I thought they included decibel meters but they are only inaccurate thermometers and supposedly measure CO2 levels. Those are also insanely inaccurate. Their support department takes about a week to respond and doesn't actually help you with the issue. I'd avoid the app unless you are only wanting inaccurate temperature readings. The other information is ridiculously inaccurate or just completely fabricated.

It's great to have hyper-local data of the weather broadcasted to me every ten minutes! All of the features work great, although perhaps because of my location far under an overhang my weather station does not respond to sudden weather changes as fast as some other stations in the area.\n\nIt does have some issues, the major one for me is that the CO2 sensor always has shown 5000. When I actually tried to have it fixed, the warranty had expired, and it's $79 for another indoor module. I would have loved to know CO2 levels in my house... Another issue I was having for a long time was that it was having problems connecting to the wifi. However, when I moved it to a place where there was a door and a wall instead of two walls between it and the signal, it connected consistently. \n\nAlso, in times of low humidity, it always reads a higher humidity then other stations. When most stations in the area were reading 4-7%, mine read 11%. The pressure readings were too high as well, but I found a solution. I subtracted 90 feet from my altitude in location settings, and it fixed the problem.\n\nI also have gotten the rain gauge, and it works perfectly. I like the graphs that are provided as well, although with the new update they get annoyingly zoomed in every time I leave and come back. Overall though, it's a great weather station and perfect for weather watching.\n\nPlease read: Everyone, this app requires a weather station to work, and to calibrate your barometer change your stations altitude in settings - 9 ft is around 0.01 inches of mercury change. Add altitude to increase the readings and subtract altitude to decrease them.","updated":"2015-06-24T08:00:31-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=532538499&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"937533208","userName":"Ssr7","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id48871363","version":"1.3.1","score":4,"title":"Slick clean app","text":"Works as expected with no issues.
