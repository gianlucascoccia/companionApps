But what makes me rate this ones start short of great, is the fact that once you add number to the blacklist, there's no way to remember — say days or a week later — if you blacklisted that number. Where as on the website when you blacklist a number there is a visual cue (a red circle with a line through it) that let's you know that you have successfully added that number to the blacklist. \n\nCurrently, when you go back to look at at number you may have blacklisted the day before, it still says \"Add to Blacklist\" as if you never took any action on that number. And if you tap that link, it takes you through the process as if you didn't blacklist it. That made me have go to the website just to double check that it the blacklist was actually applied — which renders the efficiency and convenience of the new feature moot. It can be something like turning the \"Add to Blacklist\" red or replacing that with the red circle with the line through it (like on the website) to let you know that you were sucessful in blacklisting a number.","updated":"2017-08-01T08:23:12-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1074074904&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1919128120","userName":"MoveeMom","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id560175087","version":"7.1","score":4,"title":"Love this!","text":"after years of having Ooma as my main phone line, I love that now I can finally get calls on my cell phone.

The volume control does not work, the mute control does not work, and the app's display orientation is only correct when holding an iPad in portrait view. When holding iPad horizontally, in landscape view, Ooma's app remains oriented in the other position. There are a few other quirky things about the app I don't like as well, but if Ooma were to fix these problems, I would consider their app to be good.

I was skeptical initially about Ooma but two of my friends highly recommended it. I’m glad that I listened to them. \n\nChoosing a phone number from the locale in the USA where I have most of my contacts has allowed simple dialing and I have used Ooma exclusively for international calls now for eight months. Since calls are placed using a local USA number it is very easy for people to return calls without any special dialing. There are no international charges or fees, and the quality of the calls are crystalline (at least as clear as when I’m in the USA using the local phone service there) with no calls being dropped. \n\nI do all of my calls off the Ooma app on an iPhone which works perfectly using either Wi-Fi or data on my local cell plan. Compared to other proprietary apps this one uses battery storage sparingly, so extended calls for business or to friends doesn’t flatten the battery. This app has made it convenient to use this service just like another line on my phone; the phone rings with a different chime letting me know it’s an Ooma call, I touch the screen to accept the call and I’m speaking to someone on the other side of the world just like they were next door. The value for the cost of the service is tremendous. \n\nI’m a very picky, skeptical person and Ooma has provided service well beyond my expectations.","updated":"2018-02-16T11:27:47-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1074074904&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5875276436","userName":"bagley auto","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id921317032","version":"7.4.3","score":5,"title":"Excellent","text":"Great app and great Company!","updated":"2020-04-28T06:42:50-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1074074904&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"4178158080","userName":"lomree","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id621781276","version":"7.4.1","score":1,"title":"Disgraceful Customer Service","text":"Absolutely horrible customer service","updated":"2019-05-19T18:09:40-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1074074904&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"2761725224","userName":"Steve Florida","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id352675744","version":"7.3.1","score":5,"title":"App works great","text":"Ooma app works great","updated":"2018-06-24T12:37:50-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1074074904&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"2009419568","userName":"dldnh","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id36677390","version":"7.1","score":1,"title":"Not great","text":"When it works, it works OK.

The option does exist to simply forward calls to another number, such as your cell #, but with this method you can't distinguish direct incoming calls from those forwarded by Ooma service.\n\nIt would also be great to see Telo Status reported from within the app, especially those times when traveling or away from home.

I have a couple of main complaints about the company.  The app is slowly getting better, but doesn’t really match their website yet.  My two issues are that the company doesn’t seem to listen to people who post issues or recommendations on their Forum site.  I’ve reported several issues and have never received a company response.  And I’ve seen many others equally ignored.\n\nThe other issue is that I greatly regret buying their Ooma branded home phones.  The Telo is fine, the Lynx works pretty good, but the three handsets I bought are buggy, poor quality sound and frequent ‘updates’ shuts down your entire phone system until all phones are updated (1 - 1.5 hours each time).  You have no control when this happens.  And when people call me the system drops the call a few seconds after I answer, making it seem like I am purposely hanging up on people.   Reported this and other things on their Forums, no response ...\n\nPrior review:\nThough I have not used this app much since recently downloading it (though I plan to use it more) I can say that over the years I have had this VOIP service I have been very pleased with it.  I do think that Ooma was a little slow in adding features at first, I have been happy with its evolution.  My original Ooma Hub has been in service all these years with only one service failure that I recall.  Though it was the service, not the Hub that experienced the service gap (less than one day of downtime as I recall).  I have now replaced the dependable Hub with a new Telo (and Telo Linx).   No company or service is perfect, but my experience with Ooma has been a positive one and though somewhat skeptical at first whether the startup Ooma company would survive I am glad they have done so.  I also like the integration with my Amazon Echo (and look forward to some feature enhancements with both devices).  Also, I, like many, would like to see an iPad version.  It's been far too long coming.  Having a phone version only is amateurish.","updated":"2019-01-08T20:00:49-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1074074904&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"2232105222","userName":"Compusmurf","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id12342811","version":"7.2","score":3,"title":"Won't stop ringing!","text":"I finally turned on incoming and outgoing calls in the IOS app since I keep an old iPhone on the nightstand as a quick browsing device.
