I suspect this new issue is a fault in the Johnson Controls servers, but in any case a Wi-Fi thermostat that you can’t connect to is more than worthless, it’s a liability.","updated":"2021-11-28T02:03:08-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1001612622&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"7320112792","userName":"Morganrenae","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id107277583","version":"2.0.48","score":1,"title":"App is awful","text":"Initially after setup everything worked well until I was randomly signed out one day.

However in the app the new silly temperature control needle swings left and right, but the temp won’t change. Completely broken. So I can look at the heat usage statistics, but I can’t actually control the thermostat.\n\nMy downstairs GEO can’t connect through WiFi at all since the update, so it’s now a dumb thermostat.\n\nNot as dumb as this app, though.\n\nAnd to add the cherry on top, Lux keeps sending me email after email that my filter needs changing. They have no idea what kind of furnace I’m using or what the filter schedule actually is, but the emails keep coming and there is no way to tell them to stop. No unsubscribe, no feedback link. \n\nTime to research new thermostats.\n\nUpdate: I just received two new Sensi Touch thermostats and two 24v plug in power adapters  which I discovered can easily be used to power the Sensis without a C wire.\n\nThey arrived just in time. My upstairs GEO is doing that thing again where I wake up cold because it thinks the room temp is six degrees hotter than it actually is, and I have to raise the temp to 76 degrees until it randomly fixes itself, after which I have to turn it down again after coming home to an overheated house. The online scuttlebutt is that the wifi circuitry is too close to the temp sensor; it heats up when there is heavy wifi activity or problems connecting, and the sensor thinks the room is warmer than it is. When it finally finishes whatever it was trying to do, it cools down again and your house overheats. I put up with that more than a dozen times over the last three years. But this latest travesty of an app update and the barrage of unstoppable emails was the last straw.\n\nGoodbye, Lux.\n\nLast update: removed the GEO and installed the Sensi Touch with a cheap plug-in 24 volt wall adapter. It worked immediately and connected to wifi and the iPhone app with zero issues. Up and fully running in about five minutes. Lux went in the trash. Downstairs GEO will be replaced tomorrow. \n\nFor those who have two wire systems, on the Sensi cut the RH/RC jumper loop, connect white to W/E, red to RH, and the two wires from the transformer to RC and C.  (Doesn’t matter which goes to which). The jumper to cut is a little loop of bare silver wire sticking out on the right of the terminals. It’s labeled. Easy peasy.","updated":"2020-12-05T20:25:33-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1001612622&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1574876304","userName":"VtFacilities","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id358198471","version":"1.8","score":2,"title":"A little more wanted","text":"I enjoy the remote and app use, and its relative easy setup.

For the first few months it worked pretty well and it was great to be able to control remotely. The interface was never super user-friendly but we could figure it out. Then over time it started glitching constantly. First, it drops WiFi every 2-3 days. And the reconnect process is not intuitive, so you have to go online and search forever to find the steps. Then it keeps saying the device is offline, even though the connection was “successful.” Also, the cool vs heat settings will simply disappear. The troubleshooting instructions on the Lux website are useless. They tell you to take actions that are not even doable. For example, it tells you to simply toggle between cool and heat. (Duh) The problem is that one or the other is not even showing! So right now (October in the south), we need A/C during the day and heat at night. But our heat won’t come on because the thermostat isn’t recognizing it. And when we saw Error code 5, the online manual shows every code BUT 5. And even with the codes shown, it defines the problem but gives no link to a solution. \n\nNow they’ve released a new “updated” app and it’s worse than ever. I work full time and their customer service is only open during normal business hours, so forget getting help evenings and weekends, when I actually have time to mess with it for hours. And when I finally called during business hours, they’re “experiencing long wait times and are aware of problems with our new app.”  NO KIDDING! Lux needs to invest in some tech and developers who have a clue. If you’re a potential buyer, wait until their reviews improve, or brace yourself for ongoing frustration. This was not a cheap thermostat, and it’s too late to return so I’m stuck with it.

The previous one was simple, intuitive, always did what was expected, and I couldn’t find any bugs. In this new app, the bugs find you, i.e. set up a daily repeating schedule, then toggle between 2 events and 4 events and look carefully at the temps you had set for each day. And why is the choice only 2 or 4 events? And what are the red and green circles supposed to mean? Off? On? Heat? No heat? Stop? Go? And forget about doing an interim adjustment easily. It either works or doesn’t, if you can figure out how to do it. Hint: it usually doesn’t work. We have to walk up to the thermostat and do it manually once we realize that the app setting didn’t work. And yes, the thermostat has been reset.

Don’t get me wrong - I’m glad that I can now change the temp on the app and it works (like the old app used to), but now, when you open a thermostat in the app, click statistics, the last 24 hours usage and temp are missing. I can see how often the thermostat ran this time *yesterday* and how the temperature rose and fell over time prior to 24 hours ago, but I can no longer go into the app, and see how the temperature in the house change overnight at our other property. What’s happened? A bug, an intentional feature reduction? \nHow on earth did this app get the green light. \n\nEDIT 2 11/30/20:  Is Johnson Controls’ plan just to piss off all the Lux app users so that we switch to other brands and you no longer have to support us?  When is the app going to get fixed so that it can equal how good the old version was? It is still frustrating and useless.  For example, one of my thermostats is on schedule and set to 72F. I want to dial it back to 68F. I do so in the convoluted app, tell it to pause schedule until 4:30pm. Click ok, and the set temp immediately goes back to 72F. I give up. It’s easier and less hassle to actually walk to the thermostats now and adjust them there. You’ve gone from a great product, to utter crap going to this “version 2.0” app. Never have I been so disappointed with a product. I give up. You are not responding to all the customer complaints. You just don’t care. \nTo anyone reading this prior to purchasing- DO NOT BUY a Lux product. They manage to make the user experience unworkable after it working fine for years. You’ve been warned. Spend your money elsewhere. \n\nEDIT:  App was updated 4  days ago, allegedly, but *still* terrible. Updating the schedule in the app doesn’t necessarily mean the thermostat receives the update. Please get the app either at least as functional as the old version, or give us the old version back. Terrible. \n\nPLEASE respond to the many complaints on here about how crap the “update” to your v2.0 version of the app is being received. \n\nThe new version is TERRIBLE. Overly complex and definitely focus was given on how it looked in screenshots rather than how an end user can figure it out. \n\nIf you want to tweak the temperature until next period - good luck! Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. If it works, your new temperature either becomes a new “hold” temperature and your schedule is paused until you realize and fix it, or you actually get a pop up asking how long you’d like the new temp setting to last. Why is this functionality now broken when it worked before?\n\nThe home/away is now jacked up too. Previously it was easy to manually switch from home to away and back. Now those choices don’t appear on the location unless you have “smart away” set up. (Side note - smart away doesn’t work either). \n\nOh, and if you thought you could use the web page to tweak settings because the app is so bad - that’s no longer available too. \n\nI used to love my Lux Geos. Simple to use, at the thermostat and app. Now, I can’t wait for them to die so I have an excuse to switch to another brand. \n\nFix the “new, improved” app, or at least , let us use the old one. \n\nSO disappointed and frustrated.","updated":"2020-12-14T07:19:37-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1001612622&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"6567216781","userName":"Blarel","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id22561807","version":"2.0.12","score":1,"title":"New app it horrible!","text":"I had issues connecting it took me three days to fixed it!

We ran it though set up through the iso app MULTIPLE times. It gave an error every time. After contacting support, they told us that the iPhone app interferes with permissions and will not work. Also, we had to split our wifi bands to 2.4 and 5 and only use the 2.4 during set up. This was not mentioned in the original provided directions. So, after tracking down an old android and doing a hard reset on the thermostat and splitting the WiFi we were able to connect and use the Lux app from our phones. Barring the initial month of difficulty, set up of the schedule and other parts of the app seem to be working just fine.","updated":"2019-01-21T12:58:46-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1001612622&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1381123913","userName":"Paidtoplay1","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id111718258","version":"1.3","score":4,"title":"Lux/geo","text":"I really like this app I like some of the neat features like leave home and set up a away zone.
