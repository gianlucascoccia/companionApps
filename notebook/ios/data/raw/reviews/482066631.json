So if you have a remote that has hidden legs and likes to go into hiding then the app is great. On a funny and more truthful note, I originally got the app because my sister and I weren‚Äôt getting along at the time and she knows every morning I use the tv. For some reason the next morning I couldn‚Äôt find the remote and had a gut feeling she hid it on purpose so that I had no choice but to talk and ask her where it was (in which she probably still wouldn‚Äôt have helped to be petty). To avoid needing her help, I downloaded the app and she looked confused and shocked like ‚Äúüò≥‚Äù.  I felt like victory with my phone remote üòéüòÇ.

By that I mean, 6 months into having my tv, the batteries inside the remote actually corroded and ate away the battery contacts inside. I cleaned the inside and replaced the batteries only for it to happen again 4 months later. I was using Kirkland signature batteries the second time. After the third time of cleaning out the remote I noticed certain buttons stopped working consistently, and eventually I had to switch to using the app.\n\nThe app itself is very useful though, I can do more on it that I could with the original remote. I love that I can just open the app on my phone and not worry about looking for the remote that fell behind my bed in my sleep again. However I have one complaint about the app itself, it doesn‚Äôt have a widget.

That seems like such an oversight of something so essential in a remote app. Imagine you have a physical remote that sleeps and may or may not reload when you want to use it. Behold Roku app. Turning off auto-lock for the entire device just to keep the remote open is really a bad and unsafe alternative. Unfortunately with all the great features this app provides (especially the swipe controls and keyboard) this app becomes completely useless because eventually you will find yourself taking the path of least resistance and just reach for the physical remote. Please please add an auto-lock prevention option. IOS has this capability and from experience it‚Äôs relatively minimal effort to implement this functionality. Also Roku doesn‚Äôt seem to have an email to suggest missing features, so I‚Äôm going to be pessimistic here and assume Roku probably won‚Äôt read this and this app will never get this option.
