It takes a minute or two for the app to display the current temperatures or settings of my thermostats. Nest let you set a schedule but override that with geolocation.  Nest also ran the fan for a forced-air system for several minutes after the burners or compressor turned off to push that bonus heat or cooling around, saving additional money. Honeywell has neither feature. When I’ve asked about why I can’t have both geolocation and a schedule for my thermostats, I’m told “you currently can only have one or the other” with no explanation why or timeframe for it to get added. In fact, it doesn’t sound like they have any plan at all to implement these features. Honeywell Home is not actually Honeywell anymore, but was spun off to Resideo. Maybe Resideo doesn’t have the resources to properly support the app or the motivation to care, but now I’m stuck with a worse and worse app that hasn’t added features in…ever? and support that doesn’t want to actually listen to its customers.","updated":"2021-08-30T10:33:54-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=880332077&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"6875742898","userName":"Sillyror","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id124157023","version":"5.4.2","score":1,"title":"What A MESS","text":"I’ve had a Honeywell thermostat for three years, and until this week I’ve suffered through MULTIPLE issues that arise CONSTANTLY.

What a huge waste of money this thing was. Would return it if I could. Honeywell, if you care about customer satisfaction you should invest in better app technology so, at a minimum, all your devices features are accessible via the app. Would NOT recommend this device until Honeywell upgrades their app to have a stable WiFi connection and has significantly greater features on their app. Until that happens, this product is a waste of money if you’re need if flexibility and control when away from your home.

I’d like it to change the temp when I leave and arrive my house, but also when I leave work so it can warm or cool the house by the time I get home. Apple Home (or HomeKit as many people call it) does this, but it’s a bit confusing to use two apps instead of one. My iPhone was consuming the battery quickly, until I turned off location services on the Lyric app and only allowed while using the App on the Apple Home app. It still knows where I’m at even even if I don’t have either app loaded, but battery usage is much better.

(1) Capability to lock the panel with a pin from the app, (2) add Works with Vivint for basic temperature and home/away/vacation control and (3) set schedules to allow for the option to give priority to specific user geofencing. Since the units capture outside temperature and inside humidity, a useful feature would be to be able to set a unique Eco mode option to maintain an average temperature based on +/- of outdoor temperature. Maybe the same for humidity too.

Reality is that filter change out is dependent on hours of furnace/AC operation. Our previous thermostat had a filter reminder based on hours of operation and that worked really well — i.e., changing filter out every 300 hour of use was good practice as used filter looked the same at change out, regardless of season. A smart thermostat with email or text reminder to change filter base on hour of operation/use would be a perfect maintenance tool. We’re big fan of Honeywell and look forward to future updates.

The only solution I found is to reboot the router. The thermostat was purchased to be able to control it remotely which of course makes it useless when it disconnects every few days. It also makes geofencing unusable. Which is unusable anyhow as geofencing erroneously at times assumes you are away when all of those with access to the the thermostat are at home! I’ve tried fixing the IP address with the Linksys router versus using DHCP for the thermostats (yes, sadly I had two of these installed) to no avail. I would not recommend this Honeywell Lyric T6 ProSeries thermostat if you want to connect to it via the Lyric app.","updated":"2019-06-28T06:32:07-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=880332077&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"3754321486","userName":"TopcopFour","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id22251184","version":"4.5.0","score":4,"title":"Not reliable, very disappointed.","text":"I have a self monitoring Smart Home Security System. \n\nWhile easy to set up, it is just not reliable. \n\nFor instance, my home is a small ranch, about 1,200 sq ft, yet communications between the sensors and base station is sporadic.

Well, Homekit along with Honeywell app with geofencing has proven to be an absolute winning combination. I can schedule via Honeywell app and love the geofencing. I can automate with Homekit and Siri for further integration. There was an issue with some scheduling hanging up, but Honeywell support easily fixed it remotely. That’s the only hiccup and with service that fast and good, I’m thrilled to give 5 stars.","updated":"2019-06-05T06:19:13-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=880332077&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"8081781372","userName":"Francesca3Olive","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id218121077","version":"5.9","score":2,"title":"Barely works now","text":"Bought my house in April this year and up until recently the app worked great.

However, their camera products are horrible.

Also it does not detect people walking in my driveway even with the motion sensing set to high.  I would say 5 out of 10 times when I just check to see my driveway without an alert it may work.

I’ve had the occasional connectivity issues but now it’s VERY consistently having problems syncing. If I’m home on my Wi-Fi the app says “too many attempts” and tries to log me out. It can’t log me out though; I just get the spinning circle. So I have to turn my Wi-Fi on my phone off, force close the app, then log in with my cellular data. Only then can I adjust temp/fan settings. \nI also have problems with my geofencing. I’ll cross the threshold and then get the error message that “I crossed my geofence but the app couldn’t adjust the temp.”\nIt’s become a nuisance & it’s been that way for at least six months now. \n\nWhatever’s buggy on this app just needs to be fixed. \n\nPLEASE FIX IT!","updated":"2021-07-24T10:12:50-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=880332077&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"7072610598","userName":"IndHunter","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id110864265","version":"5.5.1","score":4,"title":"Typically Awesome!","text":"Typically this app works flawlessly and is awesome!
