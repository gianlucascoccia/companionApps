So if you‚Äôre looking for a recording from 10:30 and it‚Äôs currently 10:35, odds are you can‚Äôt see the footage you want until after 11. \n\nAny interruption kicks you out of the video you‚Äôre looking at, meaning you need to roll the dice and try and get it working again. \n\nFor some reason, if you reload the past footage 20 times or so, eventually you can get to the footage after the typical break per hour.

Still have automatic scheduling issue described below. \n\n2-23-2017 update:\nI thought the update would help with the bugs I initially discussed. NOPE. Now the app crashes after being open about 2 seconds. SAD! ONE STAR!\n\nPrevious review: Overall, the design of this app is intuitive and easy to use. The biggest annoyance is that the automatic mode scheduling feature does not work. I set times for the different modes to automatically activate, but it never works, so I am forced to manually change the mode from \"home\" to \"sleep\" every night (and change it back to \"home\" in the morning.) Secondly, trying to access cloud footage from the live stream view causes the app to hang. I am assuming this is because I have not subscribed to the cloud storage, but an error message should appear rather than the app freezing.","updated":"2017-04-22T14:47:35-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1012900028&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"3531421057","userName":"Another_Dissatisfied_customer","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id290990903","version":"5.2.02","score":1,"title":"Stopped working when WiFi password changed","text":"I agree with other users.
