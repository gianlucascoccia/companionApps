I have had a couple of times where I have had to remove the hub and re-set it up to work again.  But I can live with that minor annoyance.  My issues with it are mainly that in this day and age it should be much more user friendly and customizable.  Probably my biggest gripe with it is the lack of a portrait mode.  Using a tablet in landscape mode, especially with the way the app is set up, is very difficult because all the buttons you use the most are right in the middle where you can‚Äôt reach with your thumb while holding the pad.  Portrait mode would allow much easier reach ability and, if you think about it, a normal remote is tall not wide.  Also, it would be nice to be able to arrange buttons and sections, like the number pad and arrow wheel, how you would prefer them.  In other words make the app more customizable, which would make it more user friendly.  Instead of a sidebar on each side for activities (left side) and devices (right side), I would prefer a drop down row of icons from the top that you swipe down to view, like the google home hub has for home controls.  This would keep them hidden and out of the way except when I need them.

So far I haven‚Äôt been able to get the Harmony app to recognize my 3rd gen Apple TV. Also, there‚Äôs no easy way with the remote to switch between controlling devices which makes it pretty much just a replacement for one remote, and who needs another remote to add to their pile? The app is not optimized for the iPhone X screen and looks terrible. The app should be rebuilt from the ground up as the UI is counter intuitive and very confusing. It would be nice to have a screen where you have all you devices side by side at the bottom of the app (like iOS normal bottom-screen menu) and controls on top. Simplify. Overall the functionality is there to have an awesome universal remote app, but the implementation and execution is sloppy, ugly and clumsy.","updated":"2017-12-30T07:21:13-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=626853860&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"2440921453","userName":"godsgreatestgift","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id15373532","version":"5.4","score":4,"title":"This app isn‚Äôt nearly as bad as the reviews","text":"I don‚Äôt usually write reviews but it looked like most of the reviews left were by people having their own tech issues. \n\nThis app isn‚Äôt 100% perfect but it‚Äôs not rocket science.

The latest update has effectively bricked my remotes because, for no apparent reason, it won‚Äôt let me accept their EULA. And it won‚Äôt let me use the app until I do.  It‚Äôs also as though Logitech only expects someone to buy a single remote as its impossible to switch hubs in the app with any regularity. All in all, really poor app design and terrible architecture and this review is coming from someone who works in IOT.","updated":"2018-04-05T16:55:07-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=626853860&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"6150703479","userName":"Dooms187Day","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id378183235","version":"5.7.5","score":2,"title":"Frustrating","text":"I would say I‚Äôm above the averagewhen it comes to modern tech.
