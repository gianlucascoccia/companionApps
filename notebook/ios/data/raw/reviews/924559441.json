Neither one will connect to the App or HomeKit. I’ve reset both of them indicated by the red light and gone through the install process in the App and also via HomeKit and each device blinks green and the the App and HomeKit says ‘Unknown error occurred’ and the device never connects. I’ve gone through the procedure 20 times or more and the result is always the same. The App is also very poor in terms of use and the process literally takes 3 minutes to just fail. It seems like such a simple process and yet these devices never work. The App should connect to these devices in 30 seconds or less and not take 3 minutes to just fail. I really don’t understand why companies can not make a WiFi in wall outlet, this is the 2nd device I’ve tried with iConnect being the first.","updated":"2021-04-18T12:09:23-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=924559441&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"2547266343","userName":"APWskyrdr","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id205586334","version":"2.5.1","score":4,"title":"Beats Getting Up","text":"It’s a great smart home solution for standard electrical devices. It also integrates with other smart home solutions. \n\nConfiguring a Connect Sense device is simple, the Scenes are more involved but still intuitive. I use the app for Connect Sense products only. I use my other smart home products’ Siri access commands. \n\nSometimes the app shows a device offline and powering the device off & on clears the problem. Other times resetting and reinstalling the device is necessary to bring the device back online. \n\nThough fixing a non communicative offline device is reasonably simple, it’s not reasonable to have to endure the inconvenience so I rated the product an overall 4. It would definitely be rated a 5 if it were consistently reliable. \n\nI just downloaded another firmware upgrade; maybe that fixed the occasional offline aggravation.","updated":"2018-05-14T12:27:56-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=924559441&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"3501491951","userName":"al1111789","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id120713131","version":"2.5.1","score":5,"title":"Solid Experience","text":"On-boarding process was smooth and efficient.

I have sent you several crash reports.\n- the screenshots you are advertising in the App Store look nothing like your app.\n- The Apple Watch app doesn't have any of the functionality you suggest in your screenshots. I can only see scenes (good), and a list of my rooms (not useful at all).\n- I can't control any devices directly with the watch.\n- no support for thermostats\n- in order to turn a device on such as a light, you have to first tap on it, then tap on the power state. Why not make the app like your screenshot suggests and allow one tap to turn on the light?\n\nFor now, it's really a one star app, but I'm giving you two stars because it's free and I believe you will fix these issues in time.","updated":"2015-12-13T05:47:47-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=924559441&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"3504554049","userName":"Anthoni","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id40568022","version":"3.0.0","score":1,"title":"Stopped working!","text":"Wi-Fi completely stopped working, and will no longer connect to my app. Tried re-downloading again and again, but keep getting error problems.
