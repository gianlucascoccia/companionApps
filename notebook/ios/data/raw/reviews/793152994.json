Make the storage bigger per \"remote\" ( I love having combo buttons but it maxes out at only 900bytes). Also make it so it doesn't sign my profile out every couple days. Apple is opening up HomeKit and Siri to developers now, so the new app could have extra functionality as well (imagine being able to control it all with your voice through Siri) If you fixed all these things, more people would buy the product and the company as a whole could do much better (I personally would get multiple more RM Pros if the app was better, and I know other people that would too).","updated":"2016-07-25T08:38:19-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=793152994&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"4139404938","userName":"Ali.Snowden","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id385095331","version":"2.8.3","score":1,"title":"iPhone XR not supported","text":"You need to update your app to compatible with IPhone XR","updated":"2019-05-12T07:35:17-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=793152994&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"3403790954","userName":"BooyaShakah","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id40533849","version":"2.8.2","score":2,"title":"Support Apple Shortcuts + iPhone X","text":"PLEASE","updated":"2018-11-10T15:45:30-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=793152994&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1475429542","userName":"z0lo","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id24362973","version":"2.6.5","score":3,"title":"Works but App UI is clunky and no ipad version","text":"Fairly easy to set up, device itself is well made and has good range.
