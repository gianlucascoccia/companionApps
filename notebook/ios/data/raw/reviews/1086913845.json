Customer-no support refused to help as I did not know who gave it to me. The company I worked for had 3k+ employees, when Covid hit at least 54 passed away. Layoffs came, I emailed everyone asking who purchased gift. Long story short, I could not provide order number or name of purchase and was denied any parts or service. I tried finding the leak and repair but no luck. I decided to post on my Twitter account, and ended up with 23,000 views. 9 months later from first call I got a replacement (that I would have even paid for). They made things right after I was able to reach upper management. I love the system and app now that it‚Äôs back to working. HVR and sleep times match what my Apple Watch says.

I have the regular mattress and have been using it for about a year now. I love that I can adjust the temperature to make it warmer (especially in the winter) and that it tracks how well I sleep. There‚Äôs a few suggestions i have for the tracking. During the week I work and my schedule is really consistent (bed time and wake up time) so I would love an option for you to set a bedtime schedule/wake up schedule and that‚Äôll be when the app starts/stops tracking. Often I‚Äôll get a bad score since I‚Äôll be hanging in my room on my bed 2-3 hours before bedtime (I live with 4 roommates so sometimes that‚Äôs the only place I can go to be alone). I know you can edit it, but I feel like a preset schedule would be a lot cooler. My partner and I sleep on our specific sides of the bed, except when I go to work a few hours before he gets up, and he tends to roll to my side of the bed. So then I have to edit that. Which is where the preset wake up time would be great - so it stops recording after 5:30 when I‚Äôm definitely out of bed. \n\nAnyways, those issues are slightly inconvenient- but not a dealbreaker.

Since then I have emailed support 5 times with no response. I have also called and the guy said he would ‚Äúescalate‚Äù my issue. He then asked me which version of the app I have, I told him and he told me there was a newer version so I needed to uninstall and then reinstall the app so the newest version would be on my phone. Of course he was just telling me that to pacify me. This ‚Äúnew‚Äù version is the same update number as the version I had. It doesn‚Äôt matter what temperature I set my mattress to, it goes to this preset schedule that they made for me when I bought the mattress and filled out a little survey for almost a year ago! I have never used the schedule option and now I have no choice but to use it. Last night I woke up 10 times with my bed either being way too hot, way too cold or just turned off completely, now matter what temperature I set it to. I‚Äôm pretty disappointed, I spent over $2300 for this mattress, I‚Äôve already had to get it replaced once because it was leaking everywhere and completely ruined the mattress and box spring, that was a huge ordeal just to get the replacement, customer service is an absolute joke and now I can‚Äôt even sleep comfortably with the temperature I set because it just changes temperatures or turns off when ever I want. Just to give you an example of how frustrating this is, right before I started writing this review I had my mattress on positive 1 it has now decided it should be on negative 7.","updated":"2020-05-21T11:42:24-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1086913845&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"3165090658","userName":"J-Suter","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id100601203","version":"2.2.11","score":5,"title":"Good stuff","text":"Love the sleep analysis with this app.","updated":"2018-09-07T15:42:24-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1086913845&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"2719364994","userName":"Mercybelle","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id218752270","version":"2.2.0","score":5,"title":"I Love it, love it, love it!üíú Wonderful!üòä","text":"I have been using My Eight for over a year now and I loved it so much that for Christmas I bought my boyfriend one and he loves his too. \n\nIt‚Äôs great that you can preset it to warm your bed up and have all the presets so that you can have whatever settings you want.  As far as temperature control; absolutely wonderful. \n\nI love the way it tracks my sleep as well. It keeps a good record of whether I am or am not sleeping. It‚Äôs wonderful, great information. \n\nAs far as the new update; that is really nice too. It‚Äôs a little bit more complicated to figure out everything but I like it. The colors are wonderful and it does provide a good variety of information and a nice format.\n\nThe option of being able to hook up to all of your coffee machines etc. in the morning is very nice too but I don‚Äôt use that feature.  \n\nI do have a couple of requests: this may not be possible but I‚Äôll ask anyway. \n1) Is there anyway that you can have the whole bed set to track your sleep, instead of each half? I like to sleep in the middle of the bed but to get it to track correctly I have to sleep on one side or the other so I have to change back-and-forth.\n2) is there a way I can be notified if the bed is not connected to the hub?

[EDIT] 4/13/18 update fixed font issues!\n\nIt took me several minutes to find my nightly sleep data, because of how things have been rearranged (the bottom menu doesn‚Äôt exist anymore, replaced with a sliding up/down menu that lacks the originals Sleep item). This makes it appear that Warming is the default item, which it technically is, just hidden off screen, while the default upper onscreen material is now shows the last 7 days with ‚ÄòMore Stats‚Äô text link being the new way of getting to the familiar nightly vertical timeline. Can you say, awkward? \n\nAnother visual item that changed is the sleep score. Why remove the filled color circle behind the number? Now the score doesn‚Äôt stand out and blends in with the other added info that now pushes the vertical timeline further down the screen on an iPhone 7. \n\nAnd lastly, YAY!!! the share data with partner option FINALLY WORKS! (as of the 4/13/18 update, which is a quick replacement of the one released a week or two before, where this bug had still not been fixed ). I have been  waiting for this known bug to be fixed for nearly 8-9 months. THANK YOU, 8!\n\nOther than the above, the pad and base unit have been working relatively fine for 8 months, however our sleep scores are consistently in the 60‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs with a once a week score in the low 80‚Äôs. \n\nThe base unit daily and randomly will blink the white ‚Äútrying to connect‚Äù light for up to 10 min before finally turning purple (connected).
