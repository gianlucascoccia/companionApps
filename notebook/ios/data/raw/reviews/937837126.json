I really don’t know if the developer receives the crush details and, if they do, why this is still an issue. As a developer myself, I know there’s no issues one cannot solve. It’s just a matter of priorities. I guess the company priority is just to sell you the thermostat that turns into a regular/dumb/old fashioned one as the smart features are not accessible due to the app malfunctions. When an average app rating is this low, it tells a lot about the company.","updated":"2020-06-03T18:48:37-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=937837126&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"3267972588","userName":"Todmin","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id150155642","version":"3.0.8","score":3,"title":"Good App but No Global Connection","text":"Although you can control your thermostat through their website from any location. This app needs to be on same wifi as home to be connected to thermostat.
