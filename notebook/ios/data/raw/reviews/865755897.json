Since I simplified her medication regime and started watching her on the “Pill Cam” she has been fully compliant, her blood pressure is totally under control and no more ER visits.  While the camera is still useful for monitoring my mom, I would like my clearer picture back.

Now, my cameras only work if they're directly plugged into my network through a wired connection.  \n\nPlease fix this issue! \n\n---previous review---\nI purchased 2 of the $29 cameras on Amazon, thinking it'd be worth the (very small) risk if they didn't work out.  Turns out, I made a good bet.  The cameras were surprisingly simple to set up, and work very well for the price.  Only lingering complaint is that the audio feed from these cameras is not at all usable (just a bunch of clicking static).  The video feed isn't HD, but isn't bad either.\n\nI wanted to post this review to clarify something to those who may be on the fence about these cameras.  Specifically, the \"firmware update\" people keep referencing.\n\nWhen I initially purchased these cameras, the app used to view and configure them was fairly outdated.  The cameras worked well, but the app was less-than-stellar.  \n\nLess than a week later, the app was updated (and refreshed) the the variant seen today.  Coupled with that update, was a firmware upgrade. Unfortunately, the firmware update was a fairly crippling one, causing both of my cameras the disconnect after a few hours (and never reconnect unless they were power cycled).\n\nRoughly a week or so later, a second firmware update was made available that resolved this problem (my cams have been holding steady since that date).  \n\nSo, in summary - good camera (okay picture, bad audio), good app (that's as of this writing fully functional).  Fully worth the price, and recommended for those who desire an economical way to check on the status of their residence when away!","updated":"2016-02-09T07:12:55-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=865755897&type=Purple%20Software"}]
