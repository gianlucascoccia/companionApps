One of the cameras motion sensor plastic cover has fallen off but still works. Silicone works good around the sides to seal up bc I have spiders living in one of mine setting the motion off lol. It would be nice if night mode had a option to disable the lights so to see the actual night video instead of reflections from the led lights which drown out the pictures beyond 3-5 feet. The app stopped getting updates over a year ago and it sometimes crashes and locks up. Also I’ve noticed random disconnects from the cams to the iPhone app even though I have WiFi extenders everywhere and WiFi signal is strong. Does the cameras receive firmware updates causing reboots randomly? Any chance there will be updates to the App and firmware soon? I can’t really complain though as skybell is one of the few cams that doesn’t require a subscription which I really like and appreciate. The cams I will give a 4/5. And the app 3/5.

When I first installed this 3.5 months ago it worked great! I mean it never missed picking up motion and anytime anybody got anywhere close to the doorbell bam! Camera on! Now it’s just an expensive normal doorbell. SOB. It won’t pick up motion anymore. Don’t know what happened. All it does is activate the camera when the button is pressed but I can walk in and out of my front door ten times and it will never detect me or my roommate. About a month ago I called SkyBell customer service not once but twice. I was told that others were having a similar issue and that I need to let them upgrade me from version 5017 to 5025. I was told that would take 3 days. I waited a week. Nothing. I called back. I was told that yes I would have to keep waiting because it was taking them longer than normal and that they were having to do the upgrades one by one. They said this time that would be closer to two weeks. Well now I’ve waited a whole month and the only thing that has happened as the skybell motion sensing has gotten even worse. I mean it’s just pathetic.  For something that originally worked great out of the box and had no flaws and did everything exceptionally well, it’s baffling how a reputable company can take something so positive and screw it all up. Really starting to regret skybell all together now. I hope they get their s#!£ figured out.","updated":"2018-07-08T14:42:36-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1035457926&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"2689436099","userName":"Me.

So it would be more efficient to watch a video and pick up where you left off on the list (especially when we have 50 different video events).\n\nWhen you download a video to your cloud it doesn’t time stamp the video.\n\nWhen the doorbell is activated, if I try to view/talk to the person at the door, the app takes a solid minute or two to connect.

No way to contact, the link in the app USED to bring you thru a million steps where eventually you could get help... now it only brings you to a partner sign up page FOR BUSINESSES. If you dig around long enough you can find videos of how to reset the bell, etc. If you are away you can’t reset it if it malfunctions so all features are the useless when you need them the most. You used to be able to have them do a remote reset but you can’t contact them at all anymore to ask them to! Worst ever! Also the camera misses so many things! It records for only so many seconds at a time so you see a car pull up, for instance, but miss who got out of it and where they went. There is no option to record continuously to search thru to watch more. I see a package dropped off, then I see it’s gone but not who stole it!! The only thing it’s slightly good for is seeing who’s at your door when they ring the bell. And you can speak to them thru it IF it connects before they give up and walk away. There are multiple other issues with this device, but I’d go on all day if I listed them all. I finally was able to get support but the support was ridiculous and didn’t work. They told me to sign out and delete the app and sign back in and manually delete every video. I live in a busy area there are countless videos in the more I believe the more come back from previous days. It takes me forever. Eventually it did fix the problem but then it started right that happening again. I have done this multiple times I don’t have time to delete and over and over again. The videos and days keep appearing all out of sequence. Also when I use the filter to see who rang the doorbell it shows no videos even though my doorbell really ran multiple times. Also Also doesn’t all The filter also doesn’t work. If I watch and create an on-demand video, it appears nowhere.

It alerts us to motion at the front door, even when an insect crawls over the camera lens. Unfortunately it does not always bring up the live view very quickly, which can be a pain when a delivery person is at the front door. It also periodically hangs, necessitating a reboot of my iPhone 8. Also the icons for talking or canceling during live view sometimes disappear making it necessary to reboot the iPhone. Some of the slow behavior switching into live view may be due to an undersized, under powered server for handling all the video.\n\nI ended up getting the slim line model because they were out of the round ones.\n\nYou need to make sure your router is set up correctly and that it or an extender is close enough to the door bell to connect to it.\n\nIn short, the hardware seems serviceable, the app needs work and their server needs a boost in capacity. It would be nice if one could use ones own NAS and store the video’s locally. This would require them either writing the necessary software or publishing the hardware specs and the API for it so some one else could do that.\n\nAug 27, 2020\n   The performance has dropped to the point where it is almost unusable.

(2) Motion detection is iffy at all sensitivities and typically triggers as someone is pushing the doorbell, has been standing right next to the door for 5-10 seconds, or is actually opening the door. Worse during the day and at night after outside lights have been tuned off. At moderate lighting levels (cloudy, dusk, dawn, other porch lights on), it actually produces a really good picture. (3) Too many LED lights. When the motion detection triggers the light reflects off the wall behind and to the side and washes out some of the picture at night.

Everything worked OKAY at best the first 3 months but over the past three months I have not been able to connect. The sensor is late so only records activity after a person has walked away. Get notifications that activity is at front door but have to restart the app at least 20x to watch anything. The app only works when I am NOT connected to wifi even when I am the same network I can't connect. Avoid this app and overall the product.","updated":"2017-12-13T09:58:15-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1035457926&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1615661827","userName":"jpckrate","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id104548395","version":"3.3.8","score":5,"title":"So much more than a doorbell!","text":"In my estimation, this is one of the most highly innovative, easy to use products I've seen in 25 years.
