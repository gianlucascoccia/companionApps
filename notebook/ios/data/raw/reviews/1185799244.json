The app has not been updated in almost a year, despite the 1.8 star rating here, proof that KEF either doesn’t care or has given up. I don’t which is worse, honestly.

Sound quality, dynamics, detail and image are really impressive for a speaker of this size and at this price point.\n\nBut...we’re not here to review the speaker are we. The KEF Stream app is absolutely the Achilles heal of this total package. As much as I love the idea of this being a plug and play system to stream Spotify or Tidal without any additional hardware..it’s just not a viable reality given the poor reliability/stability of the KEF Stream app. It constantly drops the speaker connection while other devices on my network continue to operate flawlessly. \n\nMy sense is (as others have opined) that KEF, as one of the legends of British loudspeaker design and engineering, just don’t have the depth of resources and engineering talent to execute at the level needed to be a top tier player in the digital domain. I truly hope they can make the shift and elevate their capability in this regard as I’m confident they can deliver best in class digital audio technologies and loudspeakers if they can get this right. As it stands today, that is not the case. \n \nFor that reason, 1 star for the app holding back a pair of 5 star speakers. My solution has been to until Roon and simply utilize the speakers as a Roon endpoint.","updated":"2019-12-08T07:33:43-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1185799244&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"3531832637","userName":"Toomanybarts","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id12663451","version":"1.7.1","score":1,"title":"Embarrassingly appalling","text":"Tidal on here is a joke.

Unfortunately, KEF + Tidal = music not playing.  Hence what I presume was meant to be a great partnership between Tidal and KEF has resulted in a bunch of others and I jumping ship and switching to Spotify.

I haven’t tried it with Tidal, since I switched to another 16/44 service a couple years ago due to content concerns.
