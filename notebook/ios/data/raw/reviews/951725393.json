We installed this camera to monitor and detect when someone came into the alcove.  We get an alert and use the app to sound the alarm.  Be aware there is a 20-30 second delay from the time to activate the alarm until it actually sounds.  We suspect this is more of a cellular issue than product issue.  The other issue is the period we need the alarm to sound (off business hours) cannot be scheduled.  Alerts can be scheduled, but the auto alarm cannot be scheduled.  If it could, the lag issue would be eliminated.  Hopefully a software update can be provided soon so the alarm can be scheduled to automatically sound during scheduled off hours.","updated":"2020-10-02T07:31:35-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951725393&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5208504217","userName":"MAXXtreme007","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id272027976","version":"3.3.2","score":1,"title":"TERRIBLE Notifications","text":"I used to love Netatmo about a year ago. Their cameras worked well and I really enjoyed using their app; everything worked smoothly and I had no problems with software or hardware.\nThen one day, out of the blue, my Netatmo Outdoor camera just suddenly stopped working. I tried resetting it and it was obviously turning off & on because I could see the flood light. But even after troubleshooting it about a dozen times or more, Netatmo basically said it was defective and I’d have to buy a new one. I thought about it for awhile but decided against it because the software started becoming terrible!\nI get notifications CONSTANTLY now and is unbelievably annoying. The settings for the notifications used to work perfectly but now, no matter what I do, it notifies me of every single movement. I’ll sometimes have a hundred or so notifications a day now. It is so bad that I just want to destroy it.\nSave yourself some time, headache, and money and get yourself pretty much anything other than Netatmo. It may work well for a bit but then their hardware and software will become terrible. I have tried out many other options and they are much better. Get a Wyze Cam if you want something cheap or Nest Cam if you want the best.","updated":"2019-11-28T09:40:02-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951725393&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"7716915401","userName":"derajpaarg","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id174079514","version":"4.2.3","score":5,"title":"The Best","text":"I shopped HARD for an outdoor smart camera. And finding one that was comparable with HomeKit was a MUST. I know the price tag is a bit more then a Ring or whatever else seems to be the mainstream gadget, but in this case you get what you pay for. I LOVE my Netatmo Prescence. So much more then I ever thought I would. \n\nBeautiful picture, fast live stream with no lag whatsoever. It also differentiates people, animals, cars, and standard “motion” and the notifications tell you which it detects. Not many other smart cams do this and the ones that do DO NOT do it well. Night vision is perfect. I actually prefer it to the light at night. It’s SO clear. \n\nSpeaking of he light...it’s fantastic. So bright I keep it dimmed to a lower setting usually. Will turn on when motion is detected if preferred. \n\nI have SO many more things I love about this product but I’m going to wrap it up, before ppl start to think I’m a paid Netatmo employee or something lol, (joking of course, I really do love this product THAT much) and I’ll leave you with this last one, and it’s a HUGE one...this camera stores it’s data on a SD card, and it encrypts it! NO SUBSCRIPTION NECESSARY! I can’t tell you how rare that is. And of course, if you prefer, you can store the data (encrypted of course) onto Dropbox or another preferred cloud storage OR an FTP server. \n\nNever owned a Netatmo product before this.

I already contacted support 6 days ago and have only received an automated acknowledgement. There appears to be no phone number or other means of contacting Netatmo support.

I would like them to be up under the eves of my roof more and having them upside down looks funky. Plus they don’t tilt down as much when mounted upside down. \nAlso would like to see an option to link cameras to start recording when another camera has already sensed motion so they don’t have to wait for motion to activate the record mode. I have 4 Presence cameras in my front yard and would like to link them when one gets triggered with motion.\n\nIn Apple HomeKit the Flood Light appears as a light to toggle on and off. It’s also dimmable. And you get a motion sensor functionality. So I setup a bunch of automations in HomeKit to turn on multiple lights when motion is sensed at night. Lighting up outside and some inside lights depending on time of day. \n\nPros. No monthly fee. Local storage and to your own NAS or Dropbox. Apple HomeKit. \n\nCons. When mounted upside down. You can’t tilt down very far if mounted on the wall. I ended up hanging it upside down from my eves.

I spent two days troubleshooting by doing everything including turning off the 5GHz network on my router, removing wifi extenders, and even trying to add the MAC address of the device to the whitelist on the 2.4GHz network. I also used multiple iPhones and iPads to try an perform the setup but once it got to the portion of getting the Netatmo to join the network it failed every time. The only thing these devices had in common was that they were updated to the newest version of the operating system (iOS 13/iPad OS) so I retrieved and older iPad that had not yet been updated and VOILA it worked. So just a public service announcement for anyone who may have been having as much trouble as I have setting up their new device. \n\nThat being said now that I have used the app for a day the only complaint I have is that the security monitoring seems to be a little sensitive and I get notifications for person detected multiple times a day for what turns out to be a shadow. I have turned on the option to allow developers access to analytics in the hope that this software can be improved. I know that Apple recently announced that they are partnering with Netatmo for HomeKit Secure Video to allow for local devices, such as a HomePod or Apple TV, to do the brunt of the analyzing locally so maybe we will even get things such as facial recognition so that we don’t get an alert when a known family member is in the backyard. I look forward to any improvements added to this app in the future.","updated":"2019-10-04T10:42:14-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951725393&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1970544985","userName":"Marcus57","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id29765843","version":"3.0.1","score":5,"title":"Works great","text":"No problems at all","updated":"2017-12-04T11:04:56-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951725393&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5551174135","userName":"Jedinator","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id111098987","version":"4.0.0","score":5,"title":"I like the new icon","text":"Lovely orange color!","updated":"2020-02-18T23:39:10-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951725393&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"4472333165","userName":"mike472529","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id27647691","version":"3.2.0","score":1,"title":"Notification overload","text":"This was a great app but recently started sending notifications for motion sensing which I’ve never enabled.

This limits the amount of annoying notifications you get on you phone, while being fully aware of what’s going on 24/7.\n\nHuge selling point for me is the snapshots of the object which triggered the movement. I choose to only receive notifications of people detected, and each of those notifications include the name (for the Welcome) or just a close up of the person (for the Presence). Hopefully they’ll be able to carry over some of Welcome’s more advanced recognition to the Presence. I’d buy a Presence 2.0 tomorrow if it had that. Regardless, the current product’s functionality is ahead of most major competitors.\n\nThe hardware design and materials are top-notch. Very minimalist (which I prefer), but I can see them losing out on a lot of potential customers. And that’s unfortunate, because this thing is like Ring’s offering but with a head start of about 10 years (if not more, with how their promised HomeKit is going - LOL).\n\nNo issues with HomeKit support by the way. Everything registers and integrates as it should with no hiccups. \n\nHaving Ring’s flood cams, at multiple homes, I can definitely say that the two don’t even compare in everyday use ability. Basically the Ring is there to act as a backup of the video security footage, but it’ll only be useful if and when you notice something wrong/suspicious/missing/etc. Otherwise, you’d be spending a few hours a day reviewing mostly useless footage like the morning fog causing the camera to trigger, and send you over a notification with just the words “motion at your home”. \n\nOn the other hand, the Netatmo solution is basically 24/7 *keyword* ACTIVE *keyword* security monitoring. I know of every person that visited my home, and it takes me just a quick second glance to be aware of what’s going on in real-time.\n\nDid I mention there’s no obligation to sign up with a monthly fee in order to receive the full benefits of the product? Or that there’s integration with services that mostly every professional uses nowadays like Dropbox? And local storage or FTP support, in case you don’t want all your files stored somewhere probably not too safe!\n\nHaven’t had a chance to experience customer support due to no issues (other than having weak wifi signal - which isn’t their fault) with a single install or the app. Hope it’ll stay that way!\n\nSeriously, Netatmo just get so many things right that I had to write a review. (And I never do.) It’s just nice and refreshing to see a company with forward-thinking values, and a clear understanding of what people expect from today’s technology put out amazing products to the market.

The camera is good, the infrared is good except it has a big glowing red light at the front which says to an intruder here I am. Unplug me quick. \n\nWhich comes to the security aspect. For facial recognition to work well you really need to be very close to it in a well lit room. For example i had to make my son stand in front of it, because after 5 days it hadn’t yet detected he was part of the family. \n\nThe other frustration is the pictures of faces it sends you to identify. It only sends a face in a circle the size of penny or 1cent euro coin. So not so bad if you want to identify a person in the family but if it was an intruder it would not be useful for the police. \n\nThat brings me on to the next point. It is possible if the camera catches the crooks eye for the crook to quickly go up to it and unplug it and I am sure in most case it will not have time to send a picture or an alert. \n\nIt is good looking it has a good picture and good infrared image in the dark but it is more of an expensive gadget than a real security camera. \n\nRecommendations is to have a small battery included so that a picture could be sent if unplugged. \n\nThe ability to click on the faces and see the full picture video can be down loaded still. \n\nNot sure how to solve the infrared light acting as a beacon. \n\nThe Netatmo weather station is awesome the Netatmo welcome a bit of a disappointment.","updated":"2018-02-15T08:52:19-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951725393&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"6846261374","userName":"cmirf77","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id423993893","version":"4.1.4","score":5,"title":"Cmirf77","text":"Love it","updated":"2021-01-08T11:09:35-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951725393&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5349210679","userName":"tpain 21077","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id361051289","version":"3.3.5","score":4,"title":"Grod210","text":"Good","updated":"2020-01-01T18:31:39-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951725393&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1578409029","userName":"fanofallthings","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id16948295","version":"2.0.4","score":4,"title":"Easy, intuitive","text":"Easy to use and pretty simple at that.
