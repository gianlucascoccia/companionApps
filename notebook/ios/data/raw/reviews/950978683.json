I contacted customer support and they had me double-check different settings for camera A. All which turned out to be set correctly.

The timeline control is incredibly awkward and jumps around as you try to use it. The highlighted sections that should show when motion was detected sometimes don’t appear at all, especially if you’re scrolling backwards or forwards more than an hour.

Good luck guessing what 10-minute interval you want. \n\nOverall, the UI is awful.
