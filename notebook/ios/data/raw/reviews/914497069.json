You should/have buy/bought a Bluetooth speaker for that. And then u can easily enjoy your music in ultra-crappy low bandwidth/low quality in exchange for a simple direct connection that was designed for keyboards and headsets/headphones at best. Def not meant for hi quality speaker hardware like the omni. Its a total waste and akin to buying a 2 seat porsche coupe and removing the engine and replacing with 2 rows of bench seats and a battery pack. And telling porsche they should have made it more economical and family friendly.  Should have just bought a Prius or a minivan instead. Cheaper and designed for your needs and intents. \n\nThe rest of us intentionally bought this instead, to hear our music in hi quality/hi bandwidth over wifi/network instead. \n\nYes network audio is sometimes more work than it should be but good things and new tech both always require more time and energy to get right and perfect. \n\nBT is def welcome by me as an alternative for when wifi/LAN not available, but should not be the default/main form of connection. Not for these speakers anyway, they sound great especially in hi res mode. More power than u expect, much better than sonos play 1 and slightly better than heos 1\n\nAdd in the fact that the S2 can be had with a rechargeable battery and still cost less than the competition and u have a winner, ESPECIALLY if they continue to improve the music services/software/connectivity going forward","updated":"2016-07-01T18:54:03-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=914497069&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1210875770","userName":"Changeneverlasts","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id30426501","version":"2.6.5322","score":5,"title":"Awesome Sound!","text":"This app has gotten better with every update.

Linking two speakers works ok has only dropped once. Easy speaker set up. The app though stinks. Presets don‚Äôt work right. Only 1x speed for podcasts. My playlists don‚Äôt show in Amazon Music through this app. I-heart in this app is much clunkier than in the actual iHeart app. I may regift the speakers because of the app alone. I bought speakers mainly for podcasts in the morning.","updated":"2019-12-07T14:01:26-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=914497069&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"3520464234","userName":"Tatilendi","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id421797501","version":"4.74.180810","score":1,"title":"Worse product ever.","text":"I wished I could comment on the sound but I never got there after 2 days of trying to set this up.

Instead of simply acting as an extension of your phone, the app forces you to choose from a selection of predetermined music choices.

A better version would just let you connect to the device through Bluetooth, therefore allowing you to play anything you wanted to.","updated":"2016-07-02T13:51:24-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=914497069&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1377678360","userName":"Junior2387","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id223515603","version":"3.3.8178","score":2,"title":"Okay app","text":"The app is okay but it limits what you can listen to.
