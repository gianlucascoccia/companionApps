While the app was never very good, it could at least find the controller fairly reliably. Now with the 4.0 update the app rarely finds the controller locally, and remote access works 20% of the time. Often devices show up double, and nothing works. But the benefit if the system has been the ability to use physical scene keypads. This way I could eliminate the stupid app altogether. But now the LC7001 controller locks up about every 72 hours, and becomes unresponsive to keypad presses. \n\nI have to wonder what the future holds for this platform. Legrand themselves have released direct WiFi switches, essentially stating that the RF technology is on its way out. I don’t like WiFi switches for many reasons but they are newer than these switches that haven’t changed much since 2005 when Miro was introduced. \n\nPlease fix these issues.

We hired an excellent electrician, switched from touch to Wi-Fi and still had issues. The late 2019 lighting control update helped the discovery problem, but the latest 2020 update brought it back and the discovery is delayed. My landscape lights go on in a scene and shut off exactly after 15 minutes. I’ve been trouble shooting for days with Legrand, my electrician has come and no one can figure out why after the latest update. I asked if they could reset me back to the previous update or if they can repair the newest issues. When my outside lights i off, my interior lights go off and that is not supposed to happen. Some lights don’t go off and some don’t go on in a scene. QMotion shades have one shade that doesn’t always work with the rest of the scenes. Lights go on their own, they lose programming and sometimes the devices get stuck with a surge even thought I pay the electrical company a monthly fee, I have a PSP H100 whole house surge protector as it comes in the house, getting a surge protector in the panel and I have a battery back up at the equipment and each device has been modified with a surge strip. Old fashioned lights always work, but these adorne look great, but I just want the lights to go on or off when I turn them on or off or scheduled in a scene. Please send a firmware update or new update so I can turn on the lights instead of manually turning them on every 15 minutes or advise what the issue could be.

It's now May and nothing.  \n\nAlso, After installing a few thousand dollars worth of dimmers & other switches, there have been about 10 switches go bad.  I don't even know if I can return them without the original box.   \n\nFor the superior cost, we definitely are NOT getting a superior product, yet.

What a waste of money. The only positive comment I have is that the switches themselves look great. Other than that here are the things that aren’t great… - Three way switches keep losing their “pairing” to each other. So sometimes the paired switch is essentially dead. Which then causes all the lights on that circuit to not respond to the app on my phone or in wall scene controllers. Seems to happens randomly. - App is glitchy. Sometimes the app shows specific lights are off when they are on and vice versa. Must repeatedly tap the on off “slider” on the app for each switch to “wake up” the switches. - App has trouble connecting to the hub. Cue the spinning wheel of death! This is not an issue with my phone or WiFi. I have no trouble connecting to my Lutron hub (I have since started using Lutron Caseta plugs for table lamps and LOVE the Lutron product) - In wall scene controller or a scene from app must be activated repeatedly to set all of the lights on a scene. Lights are set in a random order EVERY TIME and I never know which light is going to be skipped by a controller so I have to go room to room to make sure each light was set properly defeating the purpose of a one touch programmed scene! - Hub must often be rebooted to get anything to work from app and/or scene controller (requires unplugging or inserting a pin into a tiny hole in back of a device that is hidden in a cabinet with other equipment). What a pain! I’m tired of being a contortionist to get my overpriced lighting system to work. This app seemed to get more glitchy when Legrand shifted away from Artik cloud to their own Eliot cloud remote access system. (I spent hours on the phone with technical support trying to figure out how to get my programming from artik to Eliot to no avail.) I’ve kept the app updated and routinely reboot WiFi and my phone and I do not have issues with any of my other smart home equipment or interfaces. Seems like Legrand engineering missed the boat and left all of its customers standing on the dock with them. Next project I’m going with Lutron. Legrand it would be nice if you helped my existing switches be more than just nice looking wall decor. Right now they are pretty dumb. Nothing smart about them.","updated":"2021-12-06T22:55:31-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1017835513&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"4692458255","userName":"LP in DC","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id177892043","version":"4.0","score":1,"title":"App Crashes...","text":"As soon as it is launched","updated":"2019-08-29T16:30:49-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1017835513&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"2724935696","userName":"just woowwww","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id594658083","version":"3.1","score":1,"title":"✖️","text":"This is the most dumbest app ever I hate this app omg omg omg never ever get this app it’s stupid","updated":"2018-06-19T06:54:42-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1017835513&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1299507583","userName":"nickbbah","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id29424326","version":"1.1","score":3,"title":"A lot of promise, a little buggy","text":"We installed the adorne switches through a large part of our house during a remodel.

The app works well to control lighting in the house, and the scene setup is pretty easy. \n\nI was hoping to see the \"record\" feature of the older, more expensive controller. It's also important to note that you can't control a house unless you're on that wifi (like to check it on vacation). There also doesn't seem to be an easy was to turn automated scenes on/off from the scene page. \n\nI've been a little disappointed in the reliability of the sunset/sunrise automation of certain lights. After returning from a short trip, our outside lights were on, despite supposed to being turned off 5 hours earlier when the sun rose. Since then, the same automated scenes don't always appear in the \"upcoming scene\" list. I have to edit the scene and re-saved it to make them appear in the list.

Try to get the Alexa app to discover the lighting hub... nothing! I've spent well over $2000 on switches and dimmers that are useless for voice control.","updated":"2017-10-06T12:24:47-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1017835513&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1698394163","userName":"yisterbunny","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id27092400","version":"2.0.2","score":4,"title":"Works remotely, and with Alexa / Amazon Echo","text":"The new remote access is nice, and can integrate with Alexa!  Turn lights on / off by name, fancy! Early 2.0 bugs have been fixed. However, I still encounter a bug where I can't create new automatic scenes with relative time (e.g. to turn outside lights on at sunset). This is a nice feature and used to work but hangs the app now upon creation.  One other feature request is to get Legrand Scenes to work by name from Alexa. This seems like it should work, hope it comes soon!","updated":"2017-07-25T19:56:29-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1017835513&type=Purple%20Software"}]
