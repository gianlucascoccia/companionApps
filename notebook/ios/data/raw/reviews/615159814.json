The basic interface remained the same for the 6 years that I used it. The biggest draw to this alarm ecosystem was the DIY aspect and no monthly charges. I speak of all this in past tense because according to its website,  iSmart Alarm products are no longer supported and app functionality is being transferred to a third party company without guarantee of continued functionality. So those of us who invested considerably in their starter system and add-on offerings are understandably concerned that they invested in equipment that is being deprecated before our eyes. I found all this out, not by a courteous email from iSmart Alarm but when my system just stopped working. The third party “meShare” who will be supporting the hardware through their app for a year, does not guarantee functionality of the equipment. And even if the hardware eventually starts interfacing with the app and they continue free service and support past 12 months, they might switch to a monthly fee system which puts a nail in the coffin of what made this system special and worth it in the first place.","updated":"2021-02-03T10:37:25-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=615159814&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1920354251","userName":"80shair","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id28529800","version":"2.0.8","score":1,"title":"Slowest company","text":"The app was mediocre at best when it was actually working.

They’ve come out with 3-4 different cameras when customers are begging for other sensors or keypads. The finale straw was when I upgraded to the iPhone X and the app wouldn’t even open anymore. A few days later the company came out and said they were working on a fix and it should be out shortly. It’s been almost two weeks and still no update. That’s two weeks I haven’t been able to arm or disarm my system. You know apple contacts these developers and helps them get their apps up to snuff before major updates or new hardware releases so they’re ready to go at launch but somewhere along the way iSmartAlarm dropped the ball.

But they are slow with new extensions, and don’t seem to have an overall corporate strategy to compete against the Nests of the work. So things like a video doorbell, that was promised several years ago, have not materialized. And their wall-mounted keypad, which started pre-orders in January 17, with schedule delivery in July 17, have only now in Nov 17, begun shipping. It is like they can only work on one sensor at a time, and each one takes a year to develop. The system is totally dependent on connection to their server — but has no monthly fee. I don’t think that is a sustainable business model. My suggestion would be to get some capital investment, offer a service that has 24-Hour monitoring for a monthly fee, and use the money to hire a whole bunch of people to build out the rest of the system sensors, and provide complete integration with other gear like Alexa.","updated":"2017-11-16T10:04:52-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=615159814&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"3295298109","userName":"Mike from Alberta","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id919394889","version":"2.0.11","score":4,"title":"Had for a month now Ok up to now","text":"Hello I am very tech savvy to begin with this alarm system up to now has worked pretty good the only problem that we have encountered is the two keypads that I purchased separately many times the keypads tell me that the pin is incorrect and I know 100% at the pin is correct I have my wife also try it and she gets the same results also The keypads audio commands sometimes do not work but then they come back Yes I did change the batteries to Duracell from the cheap ones that came with the keypads \nThis alarm is perfect for a small place and I would make sure that the sensors are no further than 30 to 50 feet away from the Cube one unit\nAfter reading many reviews I see that a lot of people are having problems and I think it’s communication because of the distance of sensors from the main cube one unit\nOther than the Keypad issues I rate this unit four star\nThe software on the app is very easy to navigate and is actually very good to help set up devices\nOne huge plus this unit has is no monitoring fees\nSiren is very weak but it should wake you up out of a deep sleep if someone attempts to coming to your place of residence\nWe originally bought this knowing what we were getting into and all we really wanted was to turn alarm on at night while we sleep and if anything occurred heaven forbid this unit would wake us up\nAll in all we were glad we purchased this unit only time will tell how long it will last for thanks for reading","updated":"2018-10-12T20:27:36-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=615159814&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"2904321339","userName":"Bretal","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id213282774","version":"2.0.11","score":1,"title":"Horrible","text":"I bought some camera from them cause I needed something the same day and the price was reasonable.

Prior to my purchase,I phoned the company, and they were very responsive to my questions. In the spring of this year 2017, the system started to go wacky, at first sending me notices of detected motion, even though the motion detector and camera were always in the same location and there was no motion.\n\nThen it was the system going offline for days, until I had to unplug and plug it back in to get the cube back online. And this keeps happening.\n\nIt started to be one problem after another with another motion detection problem last week, when it culminated this week when I noticed that two of my window sensors were offline. \n\nAccording to my phone, all the batteries were ok. So, I removed the sensors but could not add them back (device not found). Then I noticed that the red light that blinks when a window is opened or closed was not working for any of the windows that were supposed to be ok. In setting the system to home, the alarm was not triggered when I opened one of those windows. \n\nIn order to check whether the batteries were in fact ok, as the system noted, I took the battery out of the front door sensor--since that one flashed once when I opened and closed the door--and tried it with the window sensors. But nothing worked and now the battery doesn't work with the door sensor.\n\nBUT THE WORST PROBLEM is that iSmart no longer answers their phone and everything as to be done by email and nothing gets solved. I've been doing this since spring with the first motion detection problem.\n\nThis last round as of yesterday included a non-attachment of a video for installing batteries that was supposed to be attached to the email (even though I had followed the instructions that are found on the phone), and a note that a software problem was showing that all the batteries were ok although they may not be.\n\nI'm waiting to hear back and also checking into getting a new system.\n\nThe iSmart alarm system is junk, and consumers are dropped like a hot potato after purchasing the system.","updated":"2017-08-30T05:08:22-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=615159814&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"7189988556","userName":"goth pop","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id491782603","version":"2.1.4","score":1,"title":"The worst app ever just got worse.","text":"Just like the previous scammers who ran this company, the new owners are also clueless amateurs... \n\nWoke up this morning to find that all of my cameras and recorded footage WAS GONE- Upon lunching the app, it opened a blank start page, The kind you see when you launch an app for the first time.\n\nAs I understand it, this is a result of the compete overhauling of the app and after the initial shock wore off, I wasn’t upset, but actually relieved... I thought to myself “Ismartalarm must be turning over a new leaf. This is gonna be good” and was optimistic to be starting over fresh with the new app.\n\nBoy, was I a fool to think that this app would get better under new leadership. From the get go, the newly revamped app was plagued with EVEN MORE PROBLEMS then the original! \n\nAt the time of this posting, I have yet to set up a single camera. Because the app thinks I’m on 5GHz Wi-Fi, it says “Not supported” and won’t left me progress to the next step.  And to contradict that error message, right below it reads the text: “Using cellular data“ WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN? \n\nTo make sure I wasn’t crazy, I went over to my Apple Airport router and disabled 5 GHz, and also turned off cellular data on my iPhone, but to no avail.\n\nIronically, the iSmartAlarm PRO app managed to save all my cameras, but they want $49 a month and to that I say... BWAHAHAHAHA!!! You’ve gotta be kidding me if you think that I’m giving you guys a penny. That’s not how this works- have to EARN OUR BUSINESS. \n\nNeed I remind you that the previous owners ripped us off, so the burden is on YOU to regain our trust and you can start by giving everyone a free year of iSmartAlarm Pro and refunding the customers who are paying you to beta test this broken app. \n\nWe’re not your guinea pigs, we are your customers. Everything you need to know to build a great app is right here in the ratings. You don’t need to reinvent the wheel, every bud, every feature request, every idea, is ALL RIGHT HERE, so I suggest you read every single review and build the app your customers have wanted for years.","updated":"2021-04-06T04:23:02-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=615159814&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1977741107","userName":"TheTesla","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id128170901","version":"2.0.9","score":1,"title":"Run away and fast","text":"I’ve noticed the quality of this formerly fine service on a rapid decline this year, unfortunately after buying more of their Spot cameras than I could admit without being embarrassed at this point. \n\nTapping Arm/Disarm can take up to 10 MINUTES to be processed by the Cube, even on the same network as the unit and gigabit Internet speeds. But last night I still set it off with a 30 second countdown timer despite tapping “Disarm” frantically on two different devices. I had to listen to the siren while I fetched my key to unlock the enclosure physically securing the cube to kill it, which is inexcusable for an alarm system. \n\nThe app, even the latest version, crashes randomly when I go to view a camera (such as to investigate a weird noise outside in the moment), and I have to reopen it. After reopening it you have to wait for it to log back in, dismiss some in-app full screen ad trying to get you to buy more hardware, and then eventually get to your camera. \n\nThe app crashed for a month on the new iPhone X, which was announced and made available to developers to test on a month prior to the start of the month of crashes. I had to carry around two phones just to be able to use my alarm system, for a month. What does this say for forward-looking reliability to you?\n\nCloud backups of videos recorded during alarm triggers never seems to work. They just don’t appear. Same with most SD card features - don’t even bother. Just use your cameras in real-time and hope they don’t lock up and need their power bounced off and back on again.\n\nThe only integration you have with the Home app (HomeKit) at the moment is a janky IFTTT plug-in via HomeBridge, which does not relay state two ways. \n\nNo firmware updates for a good 8 months. Which means the firmware in my cube, camera and sensors must be 100% perfect, but the other issues tells me that’s probably not the case. \n\nI’m going out of town soon and I’m hiring a house sitter rather than trusting an alarm system I’ve paid over $500 into so far, since last Christmas (less than a year ago).\n\nDo NOT buy into this ecosystem, the company has completely given up apparently. The app is a joke, as is the backend it talks to given the massive latency for simple commands. I’m not sure if outsourcing is to blame or what, but it used to be a rock solid service until the past 4-6 months. \n\nLastly: the packaging looks like they want to be the Apple of alarm systems. The software bugs make it clear they are definitely copying Apple this year on software development quality control 😂😂😂\n\nFix your stuff and I’ll update my review. Otherwise consumers have a right to know your system is trash, hopefully before they spend a penny on it.","updated":"2017-12-07T07:48:09-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=615159814&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1911798906","userName":"Pharaoh2377","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id480249274","version":"2.0.8","score":1,"title":"Fix it now !!!!","text":"I CANNOT USE THE ST UPID APP ON IPHONE X, keep crashing 😡😡😡","updated":"2017-11-10T15:14:26-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=615159814&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"6961838380","userName":"franpapich","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id918223329","version":"2.1.4","score":1,"title":"WHAT HAPPENED","text":"I GOT A CAMERA THAT IT WAS WORKING GOOD BUT WITH THE NEW UPDATE IT STOPPED WORKING AND I CANT ADD THE DEVICE ...

No monthly fees and no contracts!! Plus the top of the line system is only a few hundred bucks. \n\nThe app itself is simple and very user friendly. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure it out. In addition to arming / disarming the app will send you a text indicating exactly where the activation is AND a picture of whats going on inside your home, office or wherever you have the camera installed. Plus an actual telephone call also advising of the activation. There is also a feature (that can be toggled on/off) that alerts you whenever a sensor is activated even when the alarm is disarmed.

(If I unlock my August Smart lock, disarm the system for 5 minutes and then arm it again). \n\n2. Integrate with Apple home kit. This would probably make suggestion 1 a lot easier to implement. Your company is an iOS exclusive - the fact that you haven't integrated with home kit isn't good. When my phone or tablet is unlocked, I should be able to tell Siri to arm/disarm/set home/dismiss-siren my system without even launching the app. \n\n3. WHERE ARE THE SATELLITE SIRENS? :(\n\n4.
