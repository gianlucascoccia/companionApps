However, this app oftentimes does not function properly.  The app will often report an inaccurate interior temperature and will not change the temperature setting on the thermostat after you have changed it via the app. I will have to close the app completely, including background, and reopen the app to get an accurate reading, and then control the thermostat. Another annoying lack of development, is the app only has a landscape view, negating an ability to open and operate using a single hand. These developers obviously do not use their own products. Bottom line, if you enjoy the ability to control your thermostat from your iPhone, consider another thermostat/app combination.","updated":"2018-03-23T07:37:55-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=941486794&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5221388212","userName":"ElVadim","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id101905332","version":"1.4.0","score":1,"title":"Next to useless","text":"This app is next to useless. It’s okay for temporarily changing the temperature, but anything else will either be time-consuming and tedious, or just outright won’t work. For an example, I painstakingly set a schedule (wake/away/sleep) for every day in the app. However, the furnace starts heating the house about an hour before the times shown in the app. So I thought I’d delete the settings and start over. Can’t do that. I tried using the copy function to overwrite all the days. The copy function didn’t work. I changed each day individually. The furnace still starts an hour earlier. This got very annoying since the temperature change tends to wake me up in the morning.\n\nI tried to use the guided schedule setting in the app. Choosing to modify the whole week with the same schedule caused it to get stuck after away settings. Clicking “next” did nothing. So I tried to modify just the weekend. That worked. Then when I tried to modify the weekdays, I couldn’t deselect the weekends (touching the days or the weekend button didn’t toggle the selected days). So again I forced to modify the whole week, which again got stuck at the first screen. You get my frustration. \n\nThis app is not intuitive, gets few updates, the menu system is not well thought out, and often just doesn’t do what it’s supposed to do. The fact that Carrier hasn’t fixed these problems in years makes me wonder about the quality of their heating and cooling systems.","updated":"2019-12-01T07:33:49-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=941486794&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"4607610940","userName":"Bijoubrooklyn","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id101135107","version":"1.3.0","score":3,"title":"Simple and effective","text":"Ok so I got a new carrier system and got sold on the Cor upgrade; no problem, I wanted the web access to my system and the convenience of the app.  I read the previous reviews and thought I made a bad choice...and then I got it installed, played with for a minute and realized that either carrier made some upgrades, or that everyone else were whining like spoiled brats; and they were.\n1.

Setting the schedule can be a real chore as it doesn’t always update the in app schedule or alternatively does but fails to actually change the thermostat itself.

The UI is exactly like the thermostat on the wall so you don’t have to learn two different layouts.

The app is a pain to setup (you need a code from your thermostat that isn’t where they tell you it is...) but once it’s set up the system responds quickly to changes made via the app so that’s good. My biggest issue with the app is what others have noted - the app is landscape, which makes it very hard to use. I don’t know if portrait would be much better, though. Since it’s the same UI as the thermostat portrait mode might be kind of small on an iPhone, but I’d like to have the option to choose which layout works best for me.
