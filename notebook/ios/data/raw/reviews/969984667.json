They replaced it-no cost.  The new one has been working for over two years.  Initially the software interface wasn’t properly syncing when my wife and I were setting alarm from 2 phones.  They seem to have fixed that with a system wide software update.  They’re based in France.  So Customer support is awkward at best.","updated":"2020-03-10T14:18:13-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=969984667&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"2312773040","userName":"Htre1","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id283616462","version":"2.9.1","score":4,"title":"Exactly what I was hoping for","text":"App has worked almost flawlessly....

Suddenly the MyFox camera I have suddenly stopped communicating with the app. Their support team takes weeks to respond and there is no longer US based support via phone. My parents and aunt both had the same thing happen to them. Trying to get help is like pulling teeth. I guess once they bought MyFox they decided to drop support for all of their products.
