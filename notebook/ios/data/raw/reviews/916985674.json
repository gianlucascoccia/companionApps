I relocated the original sensor to a room adjacent to the thermostat and it now works as expected also. I have had times where I could not connect with my thermostat via the iPhone app, but I could not connect with other apps at my home at that same time, indicating that my very poor internet connection was temporarily down. I can find no fault with the ecobee app, and I have found their support to be extremely good. They talked me through an issue that was similar to the ‚Äúlearning‚Äù that a competing product performed that I did not want. I would certainly recommend this product, and would definitely buy another if I ever need a new thermostat! However, it seems unlikely that I will need a new one as this one does everything I want it to and more.
