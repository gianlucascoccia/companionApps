Clicking on faqs or manuals doesn’t load up the documentation but instead redirects you to the website where you have to enter the serial number. What’s the point of telling the app what appliance I have if it doesn’t even provide manuals? Twenty minutes were setting up an account for nothing. Glad I used a burner email. Skip this app and maybe find yourself a better brand if you want decent smart control.","updated":"2021-11-20T14:03:39-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=905270470&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"7828838456","userName":"3MoviesAWeek","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id85440592","version":"3.1.8 (723)","score":1,"title":"All that info to turn use this app?","text":"I couldn’t find a model number of my appliance in your drop down menu.
