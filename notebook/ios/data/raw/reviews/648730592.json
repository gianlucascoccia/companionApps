I decided to get the August smart lock after reading many reviews, to allow access to my door stairs door. Living on the second floor and having to run downstairs 2-3 times a day for mail or delivery gets annoying after doing it for a year! I just installed it yesterday everything works perfectly, even flush-mounted the sensor. I love DIY! My favorite part is the auto-unlock feature. I hate fumbling for keys while my hands are full or the weather is weathering. Now, for the BUT! The App is pretty limited when it comes to setting user permissions under ‚ÄòAccess Level‚Äô. For instance, there's only Owner, Guest, and none. How about adding ‚ÄòFamily‚Äô group. Members who you want to give certain permissions like ‚ÄòAuto-unlock‚Äô and ‚ÄòActivity Feed‚Äô so they can receive phone alerts that the door is open or ajar, but do not have access to changing settings of the device. I think ‚ÄòApp Access‚Äô is laid out well and makes sense. Please consider adding that ability it‚Äôd be very helpful. Thank you! \n\nOoh and another thing. Since August in integrated with Alexa and has DoorSense and is able to tell if the door is open or ajar after 1 min why not have the skill notify Alexa devices.","updated":"2021-02-11T18:45:46-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=648730592&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"4345605161","userName":"amazingcolamaya","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id513978223","version":"9.3.1","score":5,"title":"BEST APP EVERü§óüòÄDEFINITELY GET ITüòÅüòÜ","text":"The app is awesome sometimes we forgot the keg to our home and we would have to wait outside but now with this app it‚Äôs like never a problem and I just bring the key just in case sometimes.

It locks my door automatically when closed for a set amount of time (or instantly if I so choose.) While this would seem beneficial in making sure I don't forget or when my hands are full, why would I want to risk being locked out when I simply walk outside for a minute? It would be more practical if I could set it for perhaps an hour or so, in case I  forget to lock it when going out for the day, but the maximum setting is only a few minutes. It would, also, be nice to be able to coordinate the function with the auto unlock, since it would seem logical that if I wanted my door to unlock automatically when returning to my home I might want it to lock automatically when leaving it. I had the idea of enabling auto lock when I was in for the evening so that my door wouldn't remain unlocked all night and wouldn't have to lock it behind me when I left in the morning. Unfortunately, when I returned from work the first day, I waited too long to enter my house after the door auto unlocked and it auto locked, again, forcing me to get out my phone to unlock it. Now, if I want to use it that way, I have to rush to get inside before it locks.

The technician said to me that the August Pro does NOT work well with Apple AirPods and it is a known ‚Äúissue‚Äù.

If the BestBuy rep told me about this problem, I simply would not have purchased it.

Very irresponsible!! So after all the time, effort and energy with this electronic yet manual lock, I will remove and return it.

(3) it would be nice to have an Apple Watch complication whose sole job is to unlock the door. ( my original Apple Watch is slow to open its August app). (4) the app should notify me ahead of time that a lock update is available and allow me to choose whether to install it. This has trapped me waiting at the door for an update when I‚Äôm trying to leave the house. (5) the Auto Unlock triggers too far away. This would be more useful to me if it unlocks as I am very close to the door. (Like 3-5 feet).
