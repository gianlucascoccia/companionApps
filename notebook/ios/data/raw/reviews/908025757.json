Last year my WiFi started to slow down significantly and I figured it was my service so I bought an upgraded almond to use as a router. I liked the features and though the WiFi was a little better it wasn’t significant. A couple months after using the router and range extender my internet started to disconnect constantly. I would use the app to check on the settings and users but it never updates in real time or it says the almond cannot be reached even when I’m in “local connection”. I have contacted support several times and they are very kind but I feel like their assistance is either a temporary fix or no fix at all. I have also upgraded my internet provider and my WiFi is still laggy. The app is zero help if the almond disconnects. I do like the features the app has however most only works with subscription. Also I wish it was easier to delete individual devices. My favorite feature is being able to block individual devices (so long you label them with a name when the first connect, otherwise there’s no way to tell which device is which). I will continue to use the almonds and app for now but I wish the app would provide updated/new features that would make the experience better for its users.","updated":"2020-04-26T07:39:41-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=908025757&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5345930411","userName":"Good Grief- What is this?","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id400158568","version":"3.7.1","score":2,"title":"Disappointed","text":"This app goes off every night such that I have to shut down my iPhone and reboot every night.

The only thing I did find was an offer to purchase some type of security software for 39.99 annually.  That is the illegal part I have to check my facts on the necessity for Securifi to even make you believe you have to buy their protection to use this product safely.

Simple. After that, nothing about Securifi and the Almond product has been easy. I decided to get the App and set up an Almond account. I did this on a weekend which is no excuse for their webservices/cloud to not work. I had to try 3 times to set up an account because I received no \"link\" via email over several tries. I finally was able to establish an account and see my router online. After looking at help pages to see why my Almond 2015 won't link to my Wemo Switch (and finding no solution) I lost my logged in connection to the website. I tried to log back and all day it tells me I can no longer log in. So I have tried logging into the App on my phone and iPad a gazillion times and it takes my log in info, a page flips on momentarily then it goes back to page asking for log in info again. I know my log in info is correct but I have hit nothing but complete roadblocks every single step of the way with Securifi and now to have the Almond App fail so miserably as well, well, it's icing on the cake. I cannot access internet account, I cannot link my Smart Home Wemo device, and now I cannot even log into my Almond App. I usually only write reviews that are truthful and positive but here I make an exception. Can't these boneheads that make such a nice looking touchscreen router have a seamless website that works and an App that works as well, especially when their cloud access via the web isn't?! And if it's all due to a \"weekend\", I don't want to hear it. Amazon works perfectly every day, all day, even on weekends to purchase, use, establish or change our accounts!
