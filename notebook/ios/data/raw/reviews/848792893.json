I found it very easy to install/configure once I downloaded the app.  My only quibble was that the wifi signal boost was modest, not as robust as I had hoped.  Still, the app worked as promised. I'm hopeful that the signal boost will be stronger for the two other bulbs that I bought and plan to deploy in other spots in my house.","updated":"2015-04-23T19:08:18-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=848792893&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1178835582","userName":"Alexwellsphoto","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id162829373","version":"v3.3.6","score":2,"title":"Not the app I thought it was","text":"Ok so while looking for an app to boost Wi-Fi signals this app appeared at the top of the search.
