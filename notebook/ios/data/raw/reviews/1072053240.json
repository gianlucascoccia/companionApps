Not the hardware or experience when you get it working.\n\nThe app will NOT let you convert your device to HomeKit - despite it having the feature to do so.\n\nThe app is horribly laid out, and very confusing. Even more so when you compare to the simplicity of the Apple HomeKit interface.\n\nIf you add the device with this app first but intend to use HomeKit, prepare to lose at least 20 minutes, as you will need to perform a factory reset on the bridge & button(s) to set it back up in HomeKit.\n\nLastly, if you add directly through HomeKit while on your 2.4GHz band of your network - it will be painless and work perfectly. I cannot stress enough how great the end result is - you get to control any HomeKit device by the touch of a button. You can add as many as you like as well, just be sure not to use this app - use HomeKit and if you add a button, simply tap the Birdge’s button and then your add-on button and it will automatically appear in the Apple Home app.\n\nGreat product - horrible app.","updated":"2019-03-21T15:23:15-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1072053240&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1749775221","userName":"ThadeousC","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id120205600","version":"1.5.1","score":5,"title":"Setup and loving it","text":"Just got my buttons set up.
