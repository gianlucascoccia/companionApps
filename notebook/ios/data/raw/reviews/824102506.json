It should not have to be a process to turn on/off the lights in my house. Having a Siri function would make things a lot quicker and easier. Many mainstream companies like Samsung, Philips, and Google already offer this for just a little more. I’ll gladly change this to 5 stars, once I see this change (or something similar).","updated":"2020-09-09T01:17:19-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=824102506&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1564560941","userName":"TRICKorDEVICE","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id32946530","version":"2.2.6","score":3,"title":"Great LED lightbulbs, app needs some work","text":"I really love the lightbulb product that is attached to this app. The problem is that the Apple Watch app has stopped working.

Worked before ios9. Please fix. Add Spotify and soundcloud integration please. Add more control over eq (presets are lacking). Add an alarm that slowly brightens. Add remote on/off function. Please fix original features that attracted me to this product, really enjoyed before recent updates. Then add my suggestions please. Going to look around for alternatives.

This was perfect, red for early morning hours, yellow for <30 minutes, then the much anticipated, green! And yes, this bulb + app support this 100%\n\nBut there’s a catch.  Close the app & turn off the power to bulb (remember, it’s in a kids room, either on a switch OR plugged in), and ALL timer information is lost and you’re expected to start over.  It fails to save state.  And forget multi device (e.g. my wife) support. \n\nAll in all, it’s an great gimmick bulb.  But the app needs a lot of polish.  First time user experience is rough, and it’s primary use case expects you to own many of these products and to set into groups.  Somehow, I expect that 95% or more of customers own only 1, so I’m not sure why such heavy focus on groups.\n\nAnyways, fix the timer support, and maybe it gets a three.  Polish the app, and maybe three.five.  But as long as the companion bulb LOSES all settings every time it loses physical power, this device will never be ready for “mission critical” applications (think: security, children), which I feel is where a 4.0 rating starts.","updated":"2015-04-12T19:18:20-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=824102506&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1126426749","userName":"Djbreadkitty","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id103019675","version":"2.1.2","score":2,"title":"Can't group lightbulbs","text":"I ordered 3 light bulbs 1 a month ago and then two more 2 weeks after.
