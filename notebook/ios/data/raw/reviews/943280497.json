The next green screen showed a plus sign and a person outline.  I clicked on the person and got a chance to create a login.  Ok, now what?  Somehow I got. BAck to the plus/person screen. I managed to enter my credit card info easily, big surprise.  I somehow got to a screen in which the lowest number of trash can bags was 120, and it suggested I would want 120 every month. ??? I may use 4 a month, one a week.  I ended up ordering 120 every 8 months although I will not run out in 8 months so I will cancel.  But wait!  Did it save my order?  No way to tell, and only a back arrow.  There is one menu item called “activity” and my order does not show up there. Where is my order?  Did I save it?  Did it disappear? Is it too much trouble to ask the user if they want to save this order?  Or a “save” button. Or a back button which warns you you have not saved.  Did preteens write this code? No standards, no consistent interface, no standards, nothing.  Except getting your credit card info and forcing you to buy a huge number of can liners.","updated":"2020-01-15T21:59:06-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=943280497&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"4818781598","userName":"vhteacher","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id24103942","version":"1.10.15","score":1,"title":"Difficult to use","text":"It’s pretty much unusable.
