At a church setting, we have Bible School in summer, revival in fall, and other times when weekly schedule needs changed. If we could save these changed schedules, we could just call them back up into service and not have to manually edit these schedules. We have 5 of these thermostats within our church.

I bought the Honeywell partly because of the reviews and partly because of the company reputation. It works, but I am a little disappointed at this point.  The thermostat does not update the indoor temp properly or often enough so it gets cold in the house before it turns the furnace on and then it overruns the set temperature so it gets too hot inside before the furnace turns off.  I thought it was a problem with the unit so I returned it and got another.  No difference.  I called the support number and got someone overseas who had no idea how to understand the problem or tell me how to fix it. In addition, the unit does not have a function to give me daily unit run times.  On the plus side, it is easy to set up and the display is easy to read.  I would give this unit 5 stars if it would work correctly and give me some idea of how much the furnace runs on a given day.\n\nUpdate, one year later.  The unit has settled in as far as holding temp goes, and I like the feature where it anticipates the heat time needed to meet the temp setting at a given time.  Especially useful given that we reduce the house temp to 60 degrees overnight in winter.  The unit senses temp drop during the night apparently and calculates the time needed to meet the warm up time in the morning.  I would give it 5 stars but there is still no function to view actual run times.","updated":"2017-10-29T14:22:52-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=469517819&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5592542841","userName":"eddie 72","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id155443549","version":"3.6.6","score":4,"title":"New User","text":"Purchased a Honeywell “Smart Home” color thermostat to replace a builder installed Honeywell thermostat on our hi-efficiency (95%) gas furnace/AC unit.  The original thermostat worked well, but the display was just too small to comfortably read, and programming, with no WiFi feature was extremely(emphasis on extremely)difficult.  The large color display on the new thermostat is excellent.  The app seems to work well, however after only a few days of use, I’ll reserve total judgement for now.  I have noticed that the outside temperature reading does not seem to update very often, and the displayed outdoor temperature rarely is even close to three remote reading thermometers we have in our home.  I have noticed that the furnace cycles more often than it did with the previous system, and the thermostat has no choice of temperature differential settings.  There is a conventional/hi-efficiency setting, which I have set to the hi-efficiency setting.  It would be my choice to have a couple of degrees differential between on and off, so the unit didn’t cycle so often.  I do plan on contacting my HVAC supplier to find out if there are any adverse effects from the more frequent cycling.  At this writing, I am about 3 months from using the AC part of my system, so may add to this review at a later date.

I have 2 systems but only purchased 1 stat to see if all was good with it. After about 2 months of having it operate my main level, I will purchase another one for my second level. The setup was a little confusing at first as the color wires did not match up to the new stat. But once I researched on what each colored wire actually is and what it does and matched that to the stat, it was pretty simple on how to wire it up. I like the outside temp feature where I can see at a glance of the outside temp,although I have other apps for that it’s still nice. Having the schedule pretty much operate the system it’s nice when like on holidays when everyone is home, I can just go to the app and change to the desired temp and it will hold there until the next scheduled setting and it will just continue with the schedule from there.

Every home/ofc is unique. I constantly question whether I should set my upstairs and downstairs thermostats +/- 1 or 2 deg apart, so that I’m not running them unnecessarily. This would be an easy thing to do and would be SUPER HELPFUL. The “reports” we get comparing last year’s running time to this year’s is useless information. The system would learn how our homes heat and cool and offer the cheapest way to do that … or give us a setting to do that automatically.

No where could I find anything about a backup system, so I tested it by turning the furnace off for a while and reconnecting. The thermostat went to a much higher (probably a preset) heat setting than I had it. So that thermostat came off the wall and went back to the store. Then I tried a $99 Sensi. It was very difficult to set up, I never could get it to connect plus it only went down to 50° and I needed to go down to 42 because that’s the temperature I keep my cabin in the winter. So they one came off the wall and went back as well. I then bought the Honeywell RTH9585. It stores settings in permanent memory, not just limited battery back up, which is great because sometimes power is out for several hours, and no batteries to change. its goes down to 40, was really easy to set up and connect to my router, app has worked flawlessly.

It's been reliable over a couple years of use. The \"air circulate\" mode is very useful and helps inhibit mold and stale air. This mode circulates air about 8 hours per day even if the heat or a/c isn't on. I like that I can see system status remotely - in other words, in addition to turning it on or off, I can see if the system is actively operating at the moment. \n\nThe mediocre: The \"air circulate\" setting can't be customized. Also, it's not intuitive. The app interface makes it seem like I have to leave the system in heating mode (but set to 55 degrees) in the summer time if I want to use the air circulate. The app should have a dedicated setting for \"air circulate\" that doesn't have an apparent requirement for the system to be left in heating mode. I can't see the status of my system fan in the app when in \"air circulate\" mode.\n\nThe bad:  There is a \"marketplace\" icon on the main screen which I don't need or want. This replaced the equally useless \"contractor\" icon which the app used to have. Now, each and every time I adjust the heat, Honeywell wants to present me an upsell.  This \"marketplace\" should be buried in a submenu somewhere. Voice control is not implemented well and I'd prefer not to have it at all.

The other thing is that it is supposed to be a “smart” device and adjust itself according to our usage trends, but it has never changed its set preferences from the day it was installed. One thing I don’t like is that it changes the heat mode to “emergency” mode too often, seems to kick in more often above 71°F which I think it’s too much too soon. The remote works great, it even works overseas! Other than that the device works great, it keeps the house at the desired temperature, although I liked the two-degree differential the other thermostat had to kick on; this one turns itself on at a one-degree differential, so it turns on more often during the day, but I haven’t noticed a difference on the electricity bill and that is fine with me.

We also went for zoned heating/cooling, meaning we have 1st and 2nd floor thermostats along with electric, automatic dampers in our duct work.

The thermostats doo a great job of keeping the house at an even temperature from top to bottom regardless of the season. I love being able to control the temperature, in particular, via my phone or iPad. The app gives me good information as far as inside/outside temps, inside/outside humidity, if the system is actually running, what the set temperature is. And it gives me this for BOTH floors. Schedules can be customized for each floor through the app, too. I particularly like the app when we have been traveling. I usually put the the temperature on a vacation hold, so about an hour away from home, I like to cancel the hold so the house is comfortable when we walk in.

One feature that I would like to see is the ability to program a “dead band” into a temperature setting.  For instance, if I don’t want the cooling system to cycle as frequently and I’m perfectly fine if the temperature “drifts” a little bit.  If a dead band feature was available I could set the temperature I desire and a number or degrees I was comfortable allowing the temperature to drift.  For example, let’s say I wanted a cooling setpoint of 78° F and was okay if the temperature drifted up to 81° F.  I could set the temperature of 78° F and a “dead band” of 3° F.  What that would do is reduce the cycling of the system and it would allow for longer run times (which is desirable, believe it or not) when the system did call for cooling.  I can do that manually using the app, but it’d be a convenient feature that would boost my rating to 4 stars.  If they added a “run time” feature so I could see how many minutes the system was on in a given day, week, month as well as the number of times it came on I’d give it 5 stars.  I know they send out a monthly energy report, but that only tells the story on a monthly basis and I assume it’s rounded up to the nearest hour.","updated":"2020-04-29T15:11:25-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=469517819&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"6330334734","userName":"JimBobStPaul","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id206123984","version":"3.8","score":5,"title":"All important features of a modern thermostat work great","text":"When I say, \"all important features of a modern thermostat\", I mean those features that control the heat/cool appliance to achieve comfort all day, each day.

After 4 calls I finally got the recording telling me it was a system upgrade but not saying when it might be done. Other than that my thermostat has performed seamlessly. I also have a Honeywell electronic air filter on my furnace and I like that the thermostat tells me when to clean the filters.","updated":"2019-01-31T10:26:46-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=469517819&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"6720851502","userName":"Rascheez","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id231455271","version":"3.9","score":5,"title":"Lots of steps, but worth the trouble!","text":"I installed an RTH9585WF thermostat and needed to run a new thermostat wire to have the C wire power going from the furnace to the thermostat.

Show which location you are on!  When you have more than one device, you have to select the location. Once in that location there is no label to let you know which device you’re connected to. \n\n3.  Allow us to edit locations. Once you set up a location you can’t edit the name, devices, or even delete a location.\n\n4.  Add a vacation or travel ability. Allow the users to set schedule for whole trying. Even add a return date/time, so the system will revert back to the regular schedule before the person returns. \n\n5.  Add the ability for the devices to notify users if settings are manually changed, temp gets above or below certain temps.\n\nThese are good right now, but with the right developer programming I think these can compete with much pricier devices.","updated":"2018-12-10T13:24:14-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=469517819&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"7924568186","userName":"Jeannis77","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id310548667","version":"3.11","score":4,"title":"Ease of use","text":"This is the second Honeywell programmable thermostat I have purchased (the first one in the ‘80s).

It would be nice to have some control so that I could set the times on and off more accurately.","updated":"2018-08-14T12:27:58-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=469517819&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"7112787493","userName":"malamb55","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id259385988","version":"3.9","score":5,"title":"Still Working","text":"We have had this thermostat for about 3 years now and it is still working very well. I like to be able to change the settings from my chair or from bed if I forgot to adjust it. I lost the internet connection once but once I updated the app it was working again. After 3 years I feel qualified to give an honest review. Quite often reviews are given to early. I would recommend this product and app.","updated":"2021-03-17T05:03:16-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=469517819&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"6953741333","userName":"bbish59","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id133605889","version":"3.9","score":5,"title":"Excellent WIFI thermostat","text":"I would say this thermostat works really well for me.  I read other reviews on the cycle times but have not experienced under/over cycling situations.  Easy to install and best of all easy to read.  Older programable unit had no backlighting and no wifi so had yo use a flashlight just to adjust.  This unit has easy to read features and buttons.  Love the outdoor temp and humidity readings too!!!  Was not sure on the wifi aspects but lately really like it.","updated":"2021-02-04T09:56:19-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=469517819&type=Purple%20Software"}]
