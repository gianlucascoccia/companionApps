Every time you switch the bulb on, there is an audible beep for the speaker Bluetooth.  If you happen to turn in the light at night when someone is sleeping, even from another room it can be heard.  There is no option that I could find to disable this audible beep.  This should be fixable if Sengled were to choose to change this.\n2). When you shut off the light switch, the last persons device that was connected to Bluetooth speaker remains ready to connect the next time the slight switch, preventing another family meme bet to connect unless the previous person deliberately disconnects their device before shutting off the switch.  I think this should be made an option in the app so that the owner can choose to administer the setting for last connected or next to connect.\n3). The lightbulb has a warm white light in its default.  While the maker claims millions of colors are achievable, I have not been able to achieve a cool white white if 5000k to match the other regular LED bulbs that this Sengled bulb is installed on.  I think that this is a programming shortcoming that should be correctable yo be able to choose a cool white or warm white for default.\n\nI hope that Sengled is paying attention to the ratings and comments and can fix these shortcomings, which in my opinion would I trade the rating to five stars.","updated":"2019-10-20T12:48:25-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=840052462&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1970746454","userName":"LabRatQueen","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id227379816","version":"4.0.7","score":1,"title":"Um fix it.","text":"It can‚Äôt EVER find my bulbs.

So the main uses of the Pulse app are controlling the light level, configuring new speakers, and setting the speakers to stereo or mono. It does these things well. \n\nThe app is very simple.

There needs to be a way to \"bump\" a connected device if trying to connect a different device.

Just to dim a light?!...  there are 3 in household with iPhones and iPads for all. That's at least 6 devices that try to use the system. It can get very confusing. First world problems I know but usually you get what you pay for. A dimmer switch might be cheaper and more efficient. \n\nThe device \"bluetoothing\" to the Master must be VERY close to the Master.  Don't venture to far  otherwise there is a lot of static. This is even when using an iPhone 7 Plus. So the device is not outdated as of 10/14/16. \n\nIf some of these things could be addressed this would be a dream come true for whole home music and light control connectivity.","updated":"2016-10-13T23:11:46-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=840052462&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1581609618","userName":"C33pays","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id39460645","version":"2.7.9","score":1,"title":"Update broke this","text":"Same as prior reviews can't connect to my  bulbs","updated":"2017-04-05T17:43:59-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=840052462&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1378135188","userName":"4amq","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id481673806","version":"2.6.2","score":1,"title":"Apple watch","text":"Why don't u have an apple watch app???????","updated":"2016-05-13T15:08:06-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=840052462&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1700700116","userName":"Jay elatab","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id248179114","version":"2.7.9","score":1,"title":"Stupid app","text":"Worse lightbulb ever","updated":"2017-07-27T08:13:37-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=840052462&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"7580398546","userName":"tootitoottoot","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1131718704","version":"4.2.6","score":1,"title":"Unsuccessful,and worthless as a three legged chair","text":"If this app had a grade, it will get a d(development needed)!Reason:it loads so long and so slow, it tries to help but nothing is helped, it even took a long time to load on settings to.
