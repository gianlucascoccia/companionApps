These are alright for simple home use. The quality of the video both during the day, and at night are sufficient. You can clearly see the persons face, and that is all that really matters. They have always detected motion well. They were decently priced. \n\nI don’t love that they require an email, and a phone number. Pick one. It just feels extra intrusive. No support team needs both on file. I also do not love that the notifications are hit or miss. I have everything set up with my preferences in both my phone settings, and the app settings yet most of the time I do not get any. So that means I have to open the app to see if anything is captured. Which makes the live video mic basically useless. If you want to relay a message verbally via the camera to family when they enter the home you will likely not be notified of its detecting motion. If you want to shout at an intruder that you’re watching them, also useless. That is a fix that is completely on the app end seeing as my notifications work for every other app I use. \n\nSo overall a decent camera, easy to set up, but crappy on the notification end. If that could be fixed I would say this would be a pretty great system.","updated":"2021-02-18T07:32:13-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1013961111&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"7751979277","userName":"bluelew","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id30142064","version":"6.2.13","score":2,"title":"Could be great, but buggy","text":"I bought 4 outdoor cameras because they were wireless and easy to setup and install. I didn’t want to go through the headache of hiring a professional to hardwire everything. So from that perspective, great idea. Problem is I find this system full of issues. Overall, it’s not dependable. Capturing thumbnails sometimes works, but most often doesn’t. The latency of live view is terrible, probably 10-15 seconds, and that’s if it works. My cameras are within 20feet of my router, and my sync module is literally next to the router so the latency can’t be because of my network which is a 300MB download. Sometimes the motion sensor will trigger but the camera won’t turn on in time And completely miss the action. Live stream audio cuts out frequently. Etc etc etc. When it works, it’s great. But there’s constant issues. I find that it doesn’t work more often than it works. Even night mode is patchy, image quality is great on one camera, but terrible of the other two. I also think the App is behind others like SimpliSafe. I’ll keep playing around with it, but it doesn’t always work and that’s annoying. Oh, and this is pretty annoying, but the whole system is sort of useless unless you sign up for their cloud service which will cost you $100 / year if you have more than one device.

I’ve been happy with the video quality, and the ease of use. The app is easy to quickly use, and the cameras have survived outside in the elements for a year. Claims of a 2 year battery life seem exaggerated at best, however. The o YL way you’re getting 2 years of battery life is if you have your cameras basically disarmed for a majority of the hours in the day, which kind of defeats the purpose of a security camera system.  But I bought it expecting that, and I am not disappointed. Batteries last about 6 months, give or take. Would I like 2 years between battery changes? Of course, but six months is still impressive. \n\nAs for the app; it’s good! My one request would be that they move the ability to schedule arm and disarm times for each individual camera, rather than the system as a whole. I have cameras in front of my house, and one in my backyard. When my kids are playing out back they’re constantly triggering the backyard camera, which drives the battery life into the ground. I’d like to be able to disarm that one at a scheduled time, while leaving the front cameras armed. I know I could do it manually, but that sort of defeats the purpose. \nI’d be willing to give the app 5 stars if that feature was added.","updated":"2019-05-12T09:43:05-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1013961111&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5923724496","userName":"Meadow Ct","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id355470986","version":"6.0.9","score":5,"title":"Just use your Common Sense","text":"I have my four cameras.

I can move these cameras pretty much anywhere I wish within 100 feet of the house. When there is too much activity from the wind blowing a bush within camera range, I can turn it off.  The night vision is great. It is not in color. I watch deer, raccoons, groundhogs very clearly. They are so sensitive that it will pick up movement when something or someone it at the outer edge of the camera range.

If I have my phone on silent, the live view should come on silent. Sometimes you're in a place where your phone is not allowed to make noise.
