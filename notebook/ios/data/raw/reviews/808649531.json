I had to purchase two systems since I have 4 garage doors.  One down in the basement and two upstairs to the main house.  All are working very well including the open and close sensor.\n\nAt present the only drawback is the activity log.  There no way to manage the log in the AP.  Log entries just keep accumulating.  I would like to delete as I go.  Some times everything before a specific date, sometimes individual entries, or delete all.\n\nOtherwise I have been pleased with the system and especially the customer support.","updated":"2017-12-28T20:33:17-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=808649531&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1994478025","userName":"Mopar 440","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id127464642","version":"2.0.0","score":5,"title":"App doesnt work very well","text":"Always seems to be an issue with using this app\nNot very convenient or reliable üí©.......\n\nAsante worked to try to help me and I ended up changing out my router and problems are gone for now.
