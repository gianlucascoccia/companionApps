Back then, editing a Raumfeld playlist was easy. Now editing a Teufel playlist is stressful. While editing a playlist, I need to gesture with one finger in just the right spot at just the right speed and at just the right direction in order to move the song I want to move. As if that wasn’t enough, I just was moving a few songs in playlist, and for no apparent reason, the playlist has now duplicated and appended itself to itself... What the —-?\n\nPlease work on this","updated":"2019-03-27T11:59:19-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=441218032&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1116996317","userName":"Magnus55","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id85241770","version":"2.7","score":4,"title":"On the right track","text":"I use the Raumfeld App almost every day to stream music to my connected sound systems. It's good, not perfect. Some buttons are too small, some services like Deezer are still missing and you can't use iTunes Match, BUT everything else works great and the developer is adding features on a regular basis. Keep up the good work, Teufel!","updated":"2014-12-21T08:42:27-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=441218032&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1983433985","userName":"Jenksnews","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id40260199","version":"3.16","score":1,"title":"Doesn’t support multiple networks","text":"We have Raumfeld system in our house and in an apartment.  Two different networks.  Both configured correctly but Raumfeld only remembers the last network setup.   We own 5 wireless speakers, love them but now app is limiting us to use only in one location.
