It’s about control and being able to use there from anywhere.\n\nAs far as the scheduling, it’s there, vacation mode there and the website interface was easy to use and had a lot of information about run times per unit.\n\nWe use the Venstar thermostats on 90% of our jobs (about 70 per year) and have never had an issue less one out of the box bad Wi-Fi card. I can’t say the same of other brands mentioned in other reviews.\n\nOne last note, we make no money on the units as they are sold and installed by the HVAC contractors. We are able to sell and profit from others but it’s not worth the service calls and angry clients when the manufacture bricks there units in January during a “firmware update”\n\nJust sayin","updated":"2018-10-04T08:47:32-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=520220656&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1315647258","userName":"Niteolo","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id427654437","version":"3.0.3","score":1,"title":"Always offline","text":"I wish I could give this app a fraction of a star","updated":"2016-01-12T21:07:36-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=520220656&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1042950336","userName":"MustangAbe","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id114570020","version":"2.1.0","score":4,"title":"Great app","text":"Works exactly as described!

As others have mentioned, 1/2 of the display is taken up with information that doesn't originate from the thermostat, at least in my case since I don't have a remote temperature sensor. That seems odd. \n\nOn the bottom of the display is a bar that says \"Disabled due to schedule\", or \"Disabled due to Away\", but what is disabled? Why not say what it is in the message? I see from the preview photos in App Store that the bar would otherwise contain heating and cooling control buttons, but that won't be obvious if there is always a schedule set.  I suggest the message, \"Manual Controls disabled due to active schedule\" or \"...due to Away mode\".\n\nThe home button toggles between Home and Away, but is Away mode new? And if so, what are the settings for it? Does it maintain a minimum and maximum temperature? The latest version of the T2000 manual on the Venstar site is 12/17 and does not discuss Away mode in any detail.\n\nThe fan button seems to toggle between Auto and On, and yet sometimes when it switches to Auto the blade icon starts to turn, and other times it doesn't. So whatever that is trying to tell the user, the caption should change to clarify it.\n\nWhen the temperature is changed it is necessary to send the changes to the thermostat, but not when the fan operation is changed. This seems inconsistent.\n\nOn my iPhone, the Venstar app was updated to the new level, and is still identified as \"Venstar\". But on my Android tablet the app simply disappeared, both from the device and from Play Store. Now the Venstar Skyport app seems to be the replacement there, but on the iPhone it's called \"Venstar\" even though it's called \"Venstar Skyport\" in the App Store. Very confusing!!\n\nSome of these actions could be explained if there was a Help function in the app. A way to display the app version would help too.","updated":"2019-03-16T08:26:48-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=520220656&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"3765037596","userName":"21Gametime","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id303812369","version":"3.0.5","score":4,"title":"Quit working,   Yesterday 2-12-19","text":"Woohoo!
