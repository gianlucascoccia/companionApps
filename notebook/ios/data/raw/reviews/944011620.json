This machine is invaluable to people who want to or need to live independently. It reminds you to take your medicine....read the reminder or Alexa will tell you the reminder.  It’s a great way to stay in touch with an elderly person. Is Grandma still in her pajamas at 2:00 in the afternoon, not getting out even though she assures you that she’s up and dressed and has walked the dog? This machine allows you to “drop in” and see grandpa taking all of his meds. You can actually “drop in” on a lonely person and eat “together” even while you are in Delaware and your loved one is in Florida if you both have the Alexa Show. To know that an elderly person is exercising, being social, eating regularly, and taking meds......what a relief! Buy an Alexa Show right now so you can get “you and your loved-one” acclimated to the machine before you actually need it... that’s why I picked 60”s as a great age to buy it.  It becomes part of your life and believe me, it is a life-saving tool.  One more thing....it is easy to install and to use. I am not kidding! You will be so grateful that someone invented this machine! It’s so helpful.","updated":"2020-02-08T07:27:58-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=944011620&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"7263431130","userName":"RH2S","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id425404719","version":"2.2.410802.0","score":2,"title":"Units not in sync, cannot redesign lists order","text":"Our sons and our bedroom are close together.

This is bad having Alexa listen to your 3 year old crank up the volume. A lot would have to change for me to ever give it 5 stars. There are some nice features but are outweighed by the bad. Alexa needs more and better Setting Controls and a way to ignore small children who like to change music every 5 seconds.

While I’m not complaining that I actually need to read the book for comprehension purposes thanks to her “glory”, having Alexa read to you that “lives” (as in “he lives for sugar”) not be read as “lives” (as in “he took fifteen lives in the war”) is chuckle-inducing but again, frustrating.

The sad reality is it used to respond so much better with correct routine defined behaviors. Now each time you provide directions or request either don’t know that or goes into a topic that is entirely of track causing unnecessary frustration. Example good night master bedroom as programmed should turn off lights and turn on fans, in lieu after requests are made multiple times it states I don’t know that or goes into a internet query. I do recall voice recognition being a stated priority of improvement. What ever upgrades that have occurred are clearly failing and undermining this technology’s assumed benefits. I’ve made a huge investment as there is a Alexa device in just about every room in my house so I had faith in the product but now ready to remove and manage all implemented smart features manually. Please improve or revert voice recognition to last years success.","updated":"2020-01-31T04:02:06-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=944011620&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5254806019","userName":"Mum to Dogs","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id168183175","version":"2.2.308706.0","score":4,"title":"Great when it works!","text":"I’m at a loss as to the problem, but now when my electricity has a short blip, I lose ALL of my alarms and reminders.

You can NOT rely on Alexa to give you these warnings in a timely fashion.  Multiple storm and flood warnings were issued today.  My Alexa device would glow yellow indicating a notification.  When I asked Alexa for my notification, it would reply, “One new notification from your Alex device.”  But, that was all it said.  It never said what the actual notification was in regards to.  Hours later, Alexa would again indicate a notification and only then, give the actual weather warning which by then had expired.  Alexa does offer many nice features; but please, do not rely on Alexa to inform you of weather watches/warnings.  In order to keep yourself and your loved one safe, you need to find a different app to keep you informed of adverse weather conditions.","updated":"2020-03-28T21:54:43-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=944011620&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5311523725","userName":"VariouVery","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id500978140","version":"2.2.309845.0","score":3,"title":"Its okay.

I enabled it and then went back to the previous page and found myself all the way at the top of the page again, causing me to restart the scrolling and find my last spot.

I have multiple speaker groups set up, including echo/sub pairs, dots connected to external speakers, several standalone echos, and an Alexa enabled receiver connected to my 5.2 hi-fi setup. It’s complex, but holy cow does it sound amazing.. or.. it used to. \n\nBecause of the variety of components in my setup, the ability to custom fine tune each speaker delay is a MUST. The app used to have this capability, letting you adjust delay timing down to the millisecond. It took some time, but worked like a dream. \n\nA few weeks ago I noticed my speaker groups were out of sync. I thought an auto firmware update or something reset the customer delay times I had set up, which was annoying, but no biggie. \n\nTo my horror, when I fired up the Alexa app to retime the delays, that setting had been removed, and replaced with a link saying “Audio Sync Problems?” - which only takes you to a page with the ability to mute individual components. No longer can you input custom delay times. *Livid*\n\nThis update to the app rendered my carefully tuned home speaker setup nearly unbearable.

As others have mentioned, the most basic features, such as lists, do not load when you need them. I would add that the smart home interface is impressively cumbersome. There’s no way to batch edit. Duplicates are created with every connection. So if you create a new scene in Hue and ask the app to discover scenes, it’ll batch import all the scenes and devices. What other apps call “a scene” is actually only possible by creating a “routine” in this app which means about 45 taps to do anything. The “scenes” in this app are just already made scenes in Hue, and there’s no way to create grouped scenes without creating a routine.","updated":"2018-04-19T07:54:00-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=944011620&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"6901670135","userName":"NurseMaggie58","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id366459256","version":"2.2.396043.0","score":5,"title":"It’s fun","text":"I have devises in several rooms.
