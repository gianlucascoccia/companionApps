Yes I like Orbi RBK50 design, it does fit into our space nicely. Counting all the Ethernet ports Netgear gave us (7) not including port for modem which makes eight. It really does makes a difference hardwiring smart TV’s, Apple TV and other devices through Ethernet ports like PlayStation. I have notice zero refreshing while streaming cable television or watching Apple TV. All cable providers stations look visually good and thinking about it my 5.1 surround sound sound fantastic.

I do question quality of Speedtest just because sometimes it gives ridicules low results compared to browser Speedtests which put Orbi off the map and beyond the stars fast. Maybe update for app will fix issue. I don’t mind having a second app called Circle to manage family members because it keeps apps much cleaner and less junky. What I don’t like is paying monthly subscription and since I don’t use Circle anyways it really doesn’t matter but I do get occasional notifications which is annoying from apps. Security: Running Bitcoin Core drives security features nuts and yet too redundant. I think to open ports and assign static addresses Orbi needs access through a browser.

It didn’t recognize the satellite when it was 10 feet away. This app provides nothing but endless waiting. Search for the satellite? How about watching a spinning circle for 3 minutes? Now do that 20 times and you will start to get the idea. For some operations there is a progress bar, but for most it is just a spinner and a message to wait for several minutes. After a reset the router forgot all admin passwords (including the default!) and was inaccessible. Finally after some combination of resets and new setups and power cycles, it finally found the satellite. Ultimately I started the install around 5pm, and everything was up and running by 9pm. The router has been working well for 8 days, but the app is broken. The device list is populated, but the app says none of them are connected to the network. The network map shows both routers, but no connected devices for either of them. The web interface for the router works as expected and shows all connected devices properly. So it is clearly an issue with the app parsing the data provided by the router. Finally, the app forces you into creating an account, and demands personal information. It automatically signs you up for trials of some virus protection BS, filling my inbox with spam from a company that I never interacted with. Welcome to a world with ads ON your router.

Our WiFi was up and running within 20 minutes.  Every item we have connected easily to the router and speeds seemed great (no specific speed tests were run, just watched Netflix on each device).  I have a 14 year old and needed to setup some limits.  I had time limits for each day on my old router where it would allow a connection to the internet between 7am and 10pm on his devices.  I also have a few websites blocked through my old router.  I could not do this on the Orbi.  You had to use Open DNS (separate website) along with the Orbi’s parental controls menu to setup websites or servers.  You could not, however, setup times for internet access to devices.  This is unacceptable to me.  The Orbi has Circle Disney setup on it, which gives you more parental controls at a cost of $5/month?!?!  That is also a separate login. Both Circle and what little parental controls within the Orbi router was just too complicated and lacking for me to keep the device, so we returned it and reconnected our old WiFi router.  We now will be looking for another router manufacturer for our home.","updated":"2018-04-15T16:14:41-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1182184397&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"3466576266","userName":"Jaqualynn","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id850165297","version":"2.2.8.14","score":5,"title":"Impressed on all accounts","text":"I am blown away by the Orbi system.

It keeps me at the first, which may be bad at the other side of the house. This is retarded and defeats the purpose of adding more satellites... other than to just extend that initial link, which is fine for a static device, but seriously, mobile devices need to be able to get the best connections always. I should also be able to manage at least manually how a device is connected with whichever base or Satellite I want.

The app worked fine before for my other orbi, but not for this one. The help desk service’s solution to my problem was to just return the orbi versus anything constructive. I knew more than he did from googling potential things to try. Unfortunately even when fixed it’s only a matter of time before something else goes wrong. Very annoying and frustrating considering I supposedly bought the best they had to offer at the time.","updated":"2021-05-12T18:48:53-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1182184397&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"6429434942","userName":"FeLoMac","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id215116373","version":"2.6.2.9","score":5,"title":"Great app & product","text":"Easy to use interface, device management, able to access your home system even when your away from home.
