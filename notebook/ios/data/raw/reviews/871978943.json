For a suggestion, I would recommend going with any other company or product that does smart watering for your lawn. The simple answer is that others don’t charge, and they do the same thing. This company has essentially gone under. Stay away from their product, as it will soon be unusable. They should just go with option 3 (see below). \n\nTheir response:\n“At the end of 2018 and after exhausting all options, Skydrop ownership made the difficult decision to discontinue operations. The immediate concern was for the many loyal customers that would see their smart controllers reduced to being dumb traditional timers when the Skydrop Cloud ceased operating. A few of the passionate (former) employees wanted to find a way to maintain the Skydrop Cloud and determine a path forward so that customers could continue using the devices and services they have enjoyed. The owners agreed to allow us to at least maintain the cloud services and retain a single full-time customer support employee.\n\nFor the last several months, as we have transitioned to positions at new companies, we have volunteered our time and personal resources to keep the cloud services up and available. Of course, this is not a long-term solution. We need to get Skydrop onto reasonable financial footing so it can either be acquired or continue operations with a few full- or part-time employees. Our options were: 1) increase sales (hard to do with no sales or marketing team); 2) ask the existing customers to pay a minimal fee to support the continuing availability of the cloud services or 3) shut down the cloud services immediately”.\n\nPrevious post:\nHad this device for three years.

I made sure to label each wire before disconnecting from old controller. I installed 6 zones worth of wiring and it was a little tight feeding it through the opening. You just have to be patient and route them perfectly. I have a well setup for my water supply and everything interfaced nicely. I was mounting to concrete block so I bought adhesive strips to attach the unit to the wall. I didn't feel like drilling into concrete so this worked perfectly.  Setup was pretty simple after I added a wifi booster. My controller is about 20 feet from my house in a storm shelter underground - Skydrop needs a really strong signal.  It is definitely easier to setup Skydrop using the app functions. There are a few options I would like to see added to the app. One would be a sprinkler test function. A canned short runtime of zones would help at the beginning of the season for sprinkler maintenance checks. Also I would like to see a garden zone feature in the app as I utilize Skydrop to water my garden. I currently have the garden sprinkler zone disabled and just manually enable it to run. I will probably just create a dedicated schedule for that zone- but think it would be better to tailor specific for a garden zone. The soil types listed really don't match my soil type by description- so I selected unsure. What about normal draining type soil? I know this is way out there- but maybe wind data could be integrated as it gets very windy in Kansas. Wind definitely affects coverage- maybe there could be a wind cutoff feature for forecasted high winds. Maybe there could be an external antenna hookup for better wifi reception for below ground installs. I have run the system for a week an have been very happy with the Skydrop's performance.","updated":"2016-05-21T04:26:47-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=871978943&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1718025370","userName":"AxnMvieFan","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id280115460","version":"3.0.2","score":4,"title":"Fun app","text":"I'm so happy I don't have to get out of my couch and go outside to access the sprinklers!!!","updated":"2017-08-07T21:48:30-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=871978943&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1558267262","userName":"kmh241","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id41386329","version":"2.8.1","score":1,"title":"Stick with making software.

Overall it has been a great part of my home management systems.  I especially like how it lets me tell it how type of soil is in the zone, what kind of sprinkler heads are in the zone (I have rotors, rotary nozzles, and regular nozzles through the various zones), and even the slope of the yard/bed in that zone.  I also have Nest products, and since Skydrop \"works with Nest\", I get a monthly update on my water usage in my Nest Home Report, as it includes Skydrop watering info.  That info help me determine how much I'm using in my home as my municipal water bill gives me a grand total for home and sprinklers.  I rated the app as 4 stars because there were some issues with the controller, or the app, a couple of months back.  I think they finally updated everything, because I haven't had any issues in the last few weeks.  All I needed to do was reset the controller to make it work again, which was a hassle, but infrequent.  Lastly, some people complain about the controller's ability to water or not water when it is raining, or when it has rained.  I use the IFTTT (If This, Then That) app, in conjunction with the Skydrop app.  Between the two, I'm never watering while it is raining.  When you properly tell Skydrop how much watering time your yard needs, it is very smart and knows when to not water after a recent rain.  Take a yard rain gauge, put it in your yard, and measure the amount of water over a given time.  I know how much time each zone needs to run to give my yard 1\" of rain every 4 days.  Skydrop gets it all done, giving the water enough time to soak in (especially on hills), so that my roots grow deep and I give my yard the 1\" of water it needs.","updated":"2017-08-10T12:49:16-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=871978943&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1388490638","userName":"jdramosgo","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id37593621","version":"2.3.0","score":5,"title":"Rain Delay Feature","text":"Hi,\n\nI'm very pleasent with the app.\n\nIs it possible to ad like a \"Rain Delay\" Feature that could skip the watering to the next schedule?\n\nThanks for adding improvements!\n\nBest Ragards\nJdramosgo","updated":"2016-06-03T15:09:32-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=871978943&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1433405822","userName":"geoklex","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id19937480","version":"2.4.2","score":1,"title":"$6 per month!

The others force you to use the app on your device. I sometimes get my irrigation service provider to work on my zones and I want him to be able to operate the system with out grabbing my phone especially when I am not at home. I am a technologist and an engineer so I feel like I know what I am doing to some extent. \n\nInstallation of the hardware on my wall was difficult but that was based on my wiring being attributed to 11 zones. I had to buy the extender. If starting this process from scratch try and keep your zones for your yard to 8 or under if possible. The extender (for 9-16 total zones) makes the wiring a touch more complicated. But the initial installation was ok. \n\nSky drop folks: make the opening on the bottom of each slat larger and kill the rubber opening. Just make the hardware as open and free of obstacles to insert the wires. \n\nUnderlying all of this is that I want to just set it and forget it and allow my watering to just occur and my grass/foliage to be just \"handled\" \n\nUse case 1: Whatever the baseline default watering pattern the app creates for you based on soil condition etc doesn't water long enough to keep my lawn from turning brown. It's imperative you create your own schedule and stick to that. Using the program sky drop creates based on soil conditions is not enough water and doesn't water frequently enough. \n\nUse case 2: I created a new schedule for August. However when I go to the home screen it still shows the watering pattern of some sort of default option. I increased the watering time for the \"August\" watering schedule but the time remaining to water is the fewer minutes attributed to the original default pattern. \n\nUse case 3: trying to see what the history of the watering in recently (part of the update in July) shows certain zones are being watered but others weren't based on inherent rain fall. It appears that 2-3 zones out of my 11 were watered. That's not what I want. Again this is that default organically created watering pattern that just shows up on the home screen. (I need to keep trying this but I think this may be fixed now) \n\nUse case 4: one of my zones appears to be active but that zone never turns on. It is probably something to do with my wiring but again the app shows that it is being watered when in fact no water is being distributed. \n\nI have more thoughts but I will start with this. I can't seem to find a contact email through your app. That might be helpful too but I am going to email my suggestions to your website later today. \n\n-RN in Long Island NY","updated":"2015-08-07T03:23:48-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=871978943&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1590540694","userName":"O'moo spudsman","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id43728200","version":"2.8.2","score":1,"title":"Unreliable","text":"My lawn is dead now","updated":"2017-04-16T16:25:17-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=871978943&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1660763758","userName":"basesnow","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id199493243","version":"3.0.1","score":1,"title":"App is getting worse","text":"Update 2:\n\nPer skydrops suggestion, I have been working with the support team.

They claim that this is because the weather service for Smart watering is expensive, but instead of charging for smart watering, they have removed any ability to control the controller via the app. So, the controller is now no better than a cheap, manual controller. I predict this company will be out of business within months if not weeks. I plan to remove the Skydrop controller and purchase a WiFi controller from Rainbird or Orbit. It’s really a shame because Skybird could have been a good device if the company hadn’t succumbed to greed.","updated":"2019-06-23T21:00:12-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=871978943&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"4359966337","userName":"Mikey. . .","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id441832375","version":"3.5.1","score":1,"title":"Disabled device!","text":"Skydrop decided to charge for using the basic controls in the app starting 6/2019.

After your recent decision to charge a subscription fee to have a fully functional app which I understand since I looked at your website and realized you are not a widely diversified Irrigation company like so many others who make the Irrigation systems and sell connected Irrigation controllers. That being said I really enjoy the product that you produce. So I paid for a month and a year which is something you should fix as I feel a little duped as it is cheaper to just pay for the year, but it's paid. But after days of calling and not getting a response after I paid and the app and web interface would  not function I was severely upset to say it politely. I purchased another irrigation controller, Orbit B-Hyve, and decided to put off installing it for a few days in hopes you would do something to rectify the situation.

I have received an email from Skydrop today regarding the extra costs that I have to pay to maintain the functionality I once had for free. I believe that this is pretty misleading since when I bought the sprinkler I was advertised that there would be NO fees. Had I known that there would be costs in the future I would’ve went with a Rachio or RainMachine which gives its users free remote control and weather data from not 1 station like Skydrop but 4. I am quite confused as to why Skydrop cannot keep up with these costs when other companies like Rachio and RainMachine can. Furthermore, my Nest thermostat also relays data from weather.com and I have to pay $0 for that. I still can’t comprehend why there is justification that the weather service is that pricey. I believe that if it is true that Skydrop Plus is being released that it is very misleading to the customers like me who bought into the system assuming that it was free. I will sadly have to revise the review I wrote on Amazon for this product as there is no way I could justify the price of this controller when others can do the job better and for free. I hope that if this subscription does become a part of your business model that I can obtain a full refund for the price I paid for the unit. I am extremely disappointed by the news I have heard today and hope that there can be some remedy.\n\nThis was the email I sent to support. Still no response back so I’m hoping Lowe’s can step in if this subscription does come into play. Skydrop’s algorithm never worked properly despite no subscription fees. It would often neglect weather data and water my lawn the next day after a heavy rainfall despite the ground being super wet. I think the most misleading part is where they advertised on their website that there were no additional subscription fees. “No. There are no additional fees or costs associated with the purchase or use of this controller.” It is funny that while other controllers like RainMachine can take weather data from 4 different sources and not charge their customers as well as integrate with moisture sensors, Skydrop cannot citing prohibitive costs for their business model. Lastly, the app is pretty clunky and will crash on older iPhones such as the iPhone 7 Plus. For anyone in the market for a smart sprinkler right now I would recommend anything that doesn’t have subscription fees and is guaranteed to stick around in the long run: Orbit B-Hyve, Rachio, etc.. Stay away from Skydrop!","updated":"2019-06-10T09:45:03-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=871978943&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"4230691861","userName":"James Hermon","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id34837063","version":"3.4.11","score":1,"title":"Beware of this company","text":"I have been a Skydrop user for 3 years and have, until now, been very pleased with the product and the software, to the point of buying an additional controller for my father as a gift.\n\nToday I received an email from the company indicating that, beginning in early June, the functionality of the controller I purchased would be severely limited unless I began to subscribe to their new service for $1.99 a month (or $17.99 a year).  It will still work as a manual controller, but the “smart” part of the controller that reacts to weather cycles will be shut off.\n\nThis is a shameful business practice.  I bought the controller for the functionality it provided, not so that I could have yet another subscription so that the company would not nerf the product I bought years ago.  If the company wanted to put this practice in place for new users going forward, that is certainly their right. But to impose this change on users who bought the controller in good faith for a set price is simply wrong.  \n\nI hope that Skydrop will reconsider this decision.  But unless they do I would be very wary of doing any business with a company with such a flexible ethical set.
