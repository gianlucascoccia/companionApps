The app works as designed.  Are there limits? Sure, just understand what they are and set your expectations.  Otherwise, invest in a different solution after you do the research.  With the current system I can administer all six cameras as expected.  I'm able to monitor each camera with varying results depending on network performance which depends on cell service or local ISP and how well WiFi is performing on your home LAN/WAN... your mileage on may vary.  Again, can't blame the app for a poor local network or signal - if you can get a good connection from the camera all the way through the chain to your mobile device then all is good. Issues are really around poor WiFi performance of the cameras themselves... Had to invest in additional access points to boost my home WiFi performance to get reliable connections to each camera.  Now that everything is tuned for optimal performance the whole system works like a charm!

When iPhone 5S is on cellular connection only (no wi-fi), app works only in relay mode. This means you can not access videos stored on camera's SD card. Apparently, in iPhone-5S version, app checks if you are on cell connection only, and switches app to work in relay mode only. I was able to prove it using this setup: 2 identical iPhone 5S, placed next to each other. Step 1: disable wifi in both phones, launch SmartCam on both phones (one by one) - and you will get relay mode only. Close apps on both phones. This step just confirms that app on either phone does not work. Step 2: Enable WiFi Hotspot on one phone, disable cell reception on the second phone, enable WiFi on the second phone and connect to the hotspot created by 1st phone. Launch SmartCam app and you will see that it works in full mode, w/o relay. \nSupport is not helping, ther official story is that Relay mode is used only if there is no enough bandwidth.

Ready to switch to a more stable product. \n\nAmong the many problems, broken server and frozen smart cam network are the most frustrating.  \n\nSamsung’s server is down not only often, but when it’s down, it is down for days and days on end.  All without warning.  The smart cam is totally dead.\n\nWhen Samsung server is not a problem, the Samsung smartcam freezes up when it cannot handle its local network conflict, like when two of us happen to access the it the same time .  Urrgh.  To unfreeze requires rebooting the smartcam.   And if you’re away from home, bad luck for as long as youre not at home. \n\nTerrible !","updated":"2019-05-29T18:56:01-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=519014699&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1841713185","userName":"Rhovero","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id28002260","version":"2.84","score":1,"title":"Ruined the app!","text":"The previous version for Events showed whether Motion and/or Audio triggered the Event.

I set the region high to avoid my cats tripping the motion center and they do anyway. Because of that, the motion alerting option is useless. For motion capture, my cameras will miss events completely sometimes which is concerning and only capture a certain period of time even if there is continuous motion. Because of that I have been forced to turn on continuous recording. \n\nThe Ugly:\nThe app is disgusting...seriously I can't believe a tech company like Samsung has something this bad out. It's ugly, clunky, unresponsive at times, and completely in-user friendly. There needs to be controls to move forward and back while viewing videos instead of having to go back and forth. Need to add a way to see an initial image of each motion capture clip so I can see if I care about it. Is it a car driving by or someone walking up to my house? \n\nSummary:\nAs much as I hate the app, I do like and recommend the camera and have high hopes of future improvements or integration with SmartThings.

I'm waiting for this app to be able to view multiple cameras instead of viewing one at a time.  If that happens then for sure I'll buy two or three more.  The two way audio on the camera helps a lot if you're monitoring kids or pets. I only gave 4 stars because of not having multiple cameras on the app. Other than that then this is a good app matched with good camera. I've tried Arlo from Netgear and that is nothing compared to this.  Tried and tested both Arlo and Smartcam HD Pro and that's when I realized how good, easy setup, and reliable the camera and app. To the developer of Smartcam app - thank you but please... add mulitple camera view option.

Slowly, but surely, I have had to whittle my praise down to what barely qualifies as a two star review. The whole point of this camera is to see who's at the front door! But every time I get an alert, pull up the app, and connect to the camera, it takes almost an entire minute before I can see an image, by which point the deliverator or friend is long gone! Then it takes another minute to pull up the recorded video, assuming it actually bothered to record this time, and hasn't destroyed the SD card yet... And don't even bother trying to pull up recorded videos if you're not on the same Wi-Fi in the same location! At least the new firmware appears to allow us to see who's at the front door remotely, and even talk to him! This is a fantastic idea, poorly executed but getting better. \n\nNow my big concern is that Samsung is moving to a subscription service. They just added their \"cloud\" service to the nagware update. If they force that on us, this is an utter waste of money, and to be avoided at all costs.

I've tried this app on my iPhone 4 with poor results.  It frequently reports that the private key I'm using was rejected, repeated attempts to connect usually succeed.  On connecting it's pretty slow to load the feed.  When it finally comes up, I've seen it work okay for awhile before just dropping out completely.
