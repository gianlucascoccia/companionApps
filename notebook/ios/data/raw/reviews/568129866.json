One is that I had a friend go check on my house the other day. He said he stopped in front of the camera and waved. I did not get a notification of that.

We use the app to hear and see the baby. Worked great for about 2 months and now after they updated everything so many times the app can't seem to find the camera on my network. We can get it to find the network for long enough to start the camera, but after a couple min the app will crash and read \"network connection cannot be established.\" Yet when I exit the app and open it again, lo and behold my camera is magically connected to the network and I can turn the camera on again for a couple min. before crashing again. I highly doubt it's my wifi going in and out because this has been going on for almost 2 months now. I tried to call about it and email about it but no response is given.
