My family, pets and I feel safe away on trips and feel like we have a great prevention from break ins. With the low cost of the video storage for all of our video devices I am always aware of what goes on in or around my house at all times. I feel secure and never have any issues setting up, connecting or using their devices. They all integrate wonderfully and I could not be happier. I have recommended to many friends and family members to get just a ring video doorbell. As a new mom with dogs it was hard when anytime someone rang, packages, whatever, our dogs would wake our baby. Now with Chime, I set a tone that doesn’t illicit barking and am aware when anyone is at the door or rings the doorbell. The motion detection is amazing and really easy to customize to not get everyone hat walks by, or you can if that’s what you want. Absolutely love this company and their products. Every time they come up with something new I’m pleased with how well thought out it is and how well it integrates.","updated":"2017-10-21T07:48:08-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=926252661&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"3079204235","userName":"581 Ford","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id171699977","version":"5.2.1","score":2,"title":"Ring 2 not ready for prime time","text":"I have a Ring 2 that’s almost worthless.

I think the only time motion is detected is when I walk walk out the front door myself or if a car drives by. I’ve had deliveries arrive and people knock on the door and there’s no motion detected and no recording in sight. Luckily the doorbell function seems to work (unless the battery is dead which is every other week) and I’ll never know who is at the door because of all the connectivity issues and super long waiting times to load the feed (even after upgrading the internet several times). Our neighborhood has had several instances of car parts stolen and even a break in at our neighbors and of course every time the battery has either been dead, no connection during the time it occurred to record, or simply no motion detected. Don’t even get me started on the online community! I shared a video I did catch of a strange man taking pictures of my neighbors house (two days before the break in) and was repeatedly called stupid and a terrible person for not calling the police despite the first sentence of the post stating the police had already been called and this was a warning to others that saw him in the neighborhood.

I can see this most recent recording on the history page, but it won’t open, yet all of the other recordings can be opened and played. I then have to close out the app that I had just opened and access the recording after that. This is a waste of time that could be dangerous if someone were trespassing on my property and looking to break in. I even made sure to download the update for the app, yet this problem still persists consistently. What is the point of having a security camera if I have to twiddle my thumbs and jump through hoops to watch the video that alerted me of the presence of unexpected motion? Being alerted at 3 a.m. of motion and then having to open and close the app a couple of times before knowing what triggered the alert is nerve-wracking. This needs to be fixed ASAP. We spent a lot of money on three Ring cameras, which are only as good as the software that comes with them.\n\nI want to add that it takes forever to connect with the live view for one of my cameras, which makes that camera virtually worthless.

In fact, I have recommended Ring over other systems to friends and family many times. I have multiple AC powered only flood cams and doorbell cams around my property.  I have AC only cams because of the detail and flexibility in the configuration of multiple motion zones on these devices.  However, in a recent update, they removed the Active checkbox that allowed for the selection of one of multiple zones defined on a cam.  As a result, you must delete your other 2 motion zones when you need one of them active.  Then, when you want them back, you must redefine them!  Why is this an issue?  Let’s say you have cams looking down on a basketball court.  When the team is practicing, you do not need to record all activity.  Instead, you just want the area/zone around the court protected by your camera system.  If someone enters the zone, you want notified.  Otherwise, no alerts.  As someone who designs interfaces and software as a profession, I can tell you that this was an unforgivable decision.  You need to think long before ever removing a powerful feature that has been inherent for years.  For this reason, my experience with the app is now a frustrating experience.  I have since stopped recommending Ring.  I am now looking for another solution.","updated":"2021-03-25T14:49:55-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=926252661&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"4482991162","userName":"Km jailjljh","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id245229579","version":"5.15.1","score":1,"title":"Can’t chime and stops working randomly","text":"We’ve had our Ring Pro for over two years and have intermittently had an issue where it would stop working right after someone rang the doorbell and wouldn’t work again until it was unplugged and plugged back in.

Well finally a customer service person was unexpectedly helpful and had me do all sorts of tests to check how much power it was getting and come to find out it gets enough power, but there’s some sort of ‘fluke’ issue some of the doorbells have that prevent them from being able to operate all the time when the in-house chime is also activated. And wouldn’t it happen to be that we finally figured the cause of this problem out a few months after the warranty period expired. They were gracious enough to offer a discount on purchasing a new one, but if I didn’t want to buy another possibly faulty doorbell I would need to deactivate my internal chime, and just keep checking my app to see when it stops working so I can go home and perform another reset. I just got done with another reset because I realized today that my doorbell hasn’t worked for over a week.

I also love seeing pictures/comments from the neighbors with ring (there seem to be a lot of us) - ring makes a great neighborhood watch.\n\nI have two very small complaints (which is why I scored it a 4 and not a 5):  I thought with power the battery would last a long time without requiring a charge.  It lasted almost 2 months.  The bright side is that I was sent an email warning me about the battery requiring a charge and the battery took seconds to remove/replace to charge it.  My second complaint is that activation is supposed to be triggered by infrared activity and not motion, yet when it’s windy, ring goes off a lot.  I could have gnats or something flying by, but I never see anything in the video.\n\nOverall - I love ring and think it’s a great product and am exploring other products in the ring family.","updated":"2018-10-10T20:00:17-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=926252661&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1849388022","userName":"Credd0514","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id11582444","version":"3.14","score":1,"title":"Latest update is disaster!!!!","text":"Ever since the latest update was released video has been delayed.

The video stream is choppy and not consistent. I continue to get pixelated video and freezing. UPS rings the doorbell and the video shows the driver leaving in his truck.

Turns out it’s a common problem “that the team is working on”. Thanks for the heads up, glad to know someone could have broken in and done what they wanted and I’d have been none the wiser. They have no idea when the problem will be fixed but it will “automatically fix itself” after an unknown amount of time. Not sure how the device will update itself when it can’t connect to the network but sure, ok. They basically brushed me off the phone and said sorry, not sorry. Thanks for the $200 paperweight Ring.... I’ll be going with a better product and a company that cares about its customer security next time. With so many options on the market please do yourself a favor and go with a different product and a different company people.","updated":"2017-10-02T11:41:16-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=926252661&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"6363675312","userName":"Milagro in San Diego","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id276023788","version":"5.29.1","score":1,"title":"Posted concern to neighbors was deleted by staff","text":"We have a number of cameras around our property in an urban area of mostly single family homes.

Ring needs to halt all new product development and put all effort toward fixing their buggy software. The core experience is broken. \n\nOld review: As others have said Ring needs to work on the core experience of using the app before adding features. When you click a notification or answer the doorbell it is a minimum of 10+ seconds before you get a picture. I always find that I can just walk to the door faster than I can load and connect to the Ring app. I have an iPhone XS Max and 150mbit fiber with Ubiquity WiFi so I know the lag isn’t due to my hardware or connection. This core experience is one of the most important parts of the product and Ring needs to improve it before I can really recommend their cameras. The slow response time really makes the doorbell and cameras pretty useless for any real time monitoring and communication. The recorded video and motion detection parts work well, but Ring markets these things for their real time functions and that part doesn’t work very well.","updated":"2019-12-09T13:20:44-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=926252661&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"7547298463","userName":"MariaOka","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id38970402","version":"5.41.0","score":3,"title":"Still bugs to fix","text":"The app works great for most Ring devices, but still lacks support others like the Ring Transformer for landscape lights. For example, the app allows you to group Ring outdoor cameras with the Transformer in a single lighting group, which enables the Transformer to light up when motion is detected on the camera. This is a really handy feature that allows you to coordinate all of your lights on the camera’s motion detector. However, the camera’s lights automatically turn off after a short time and, when they do this, they also force the Transformer to turn off the landscape lights, thus overriding whatever turn-off schedule you have set for them in the app.\n\nThis is clearly a flaw.  The app should prioritize the lifting schedule first and the landscape lights should only turn off and on with the camera OUTSIDE of the hours it is already scheduled to be turned on. Ring should fix this bug or, alternatively, give the user more options for specifying when the Transformer should respond to the motion detected on the camera.\n\nThe fact that this bug exists makes the Transformer feel like an orphaned product.","updated":"2021-07-06T16:38:54-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=926252661&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"3483417990","userName":"SirVernon","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id344674679","version":"5.6","score":2,"title":"Great Idea, poor support, and mediocre product!","text":"When I first got the ring doorbell I was beyond pleased with the idea of what it offered for the price.

You can only ‘jump’ to sections of the clip. \nWhy is this important?  \nBecause when you watch a video and want to identify a person, their clothing, their actions, their car, etc. you need to be able to replay that specific few seconds of the clip, but you cannot. You have to replay the whole clip or keep jumping to that ‘area’ of the clip. This is not a smooth user experience.\nAdditionally, maybe it’s my iPhone X or iOS version, but when i get a notification and get redirected to the message board or Live video, It doesn’t load properly unless I exit out and re-navigate to that message board or video shot.

However, as the primary, she has more options than I do. For example, she can get low battery notifications and I can’t. But I’ll change the batteries. How does this make sense? Our schedules are different and her work is demanding, so the fact that I can’t receive those notifications is an inconvenience at best. I also can’t add devices as a shared user. I have to log into the app as my wife to do so. If having a primary user is a security thing, why does ring keep suggesting I log in with her email and password? So while the app can be problematic, the root cause may be that the design of the system having a single primary is flawed, and it makes the app look bad.

It has been most frustrating and we have missed out when really needed.","updated":"2019-06-19T09:30:50-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=926252661&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"3204584316","userName":"james30909","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id214260380","version":"5.3.2","score":4,"title":"Great Flood Cam","text":"I recently installed my flood cam on September 4.

Getting live view from anywhere else in town seemed to be impossible.  At that same time I seem to be developing some recent problems with my internet box.  Talked with the service provider and confirm that my box was about 4 1/2 years old. I took the box and replace it with a \nnew one. The results were next to amazing!   All functions happen within moments now. To look at my live view cam at any time of day from anywhere in town has a completion time of three seconds now.\nSo as a comment to all of your reviewer‘s who are unhappy with speed and response.

The feature simply doesn’t work. I’ve set it up multiple times, but it constantly notifies me when people walk or drive by, nowhere near my porch. \n\nSecond, when somebody rings my doorbell, I click on the notification, which takes me to the screen to show my camera, except it mostly doesn’t ever load. I can let it load for ten minutes, and it still won’t show me who is at the door. It works sometimes, but less than half the time. Kind of defeats the purpose of having a smart doorbell. \n\nI also can’t seem to get any sort of support from Ring. Their customer service forms seem to be unusable. Like when it asks for your email address. I’ll type it in, but when I submit the form it clears the text field and tells me I need to input a valid email address. (To the developers, If you make the form submit before clearing the text field, this won’t be a problem anymore.)\n\nAnyway, it’s just frustrating. Considering switching to Nest.

As soon as you click the motion detected notification, most of the times you won’t find anybody at your door. If the courier guy left the parcel, you wouldn’t know who caused the alert until you go back to the video that got recorded. \n2) If you want to view the video that was recorded due to a motion detected, you have to refresh the app and wait for atleast a min before the video is available for viewing. Within a min, the guy has already left the door, what’s the point if I can’t view the video immediately at the time the motion is detected.\n3) The response time of the app needs to be improved. It takes a few secs from the time you click the live view to the time you can actually view the live video.\n4) Does not allow 2 way communication using echo show. Currently can only view the live video using echo show without communicating. That means at night, I have to look for my phone, turn the app on to talk to someone on the door when I have echo show right next to me.\n\nThis is a brilliant hardware that cannot live to its full potential due to software integration issues.","updated":"2018-08-16T08:50:03-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=926252661&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"7814275763","userName":"pendledon","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id151896069","version":"5.43.0","score":1,"title":"Ring is on a quest to make the least functional app","text":"Here’s what I don’t get: I’ve had a ring camera for 5 years now.

And it takes so long to get into the app when you get a notification that even if I wanted to answer a door bell ring, the person likely would have walked away already. \nOverall, I like the idea of the system, but it needs improvements. We live in an older home so hardwiring is not an option without hiring someone and even with expensive boosters / extenders, the connection many times is so poor that we can’t even live feed the cameras. I am hopeful that software updates continue to make the products better.","updated":"2018-10-03T19:45:42-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=926252661&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"2677220226","userName":"Bmax94","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id34713856","version":"4.1.18","score":4,"title":"Good products; OK app","text":"I have several Ring cameras up around the outside of the house.

So many users post sales people, and so on, people who aren’t causing any harm and are putting them all over the internet. I think the option to ‘report’ and take down a video if it’s not a lost pet, crime, and the like needs to be there because a doorbell is there so that we can talk to who is at our door but people should not be allowed to post something unless it’s serious. I really feel this distracts from the purpose of this app and I’ll say the same thing on the neighbors app to make sure you see this review and implement this.

I thought I would be able to reset and reconnect the camera remotely via the App. Nope. Not at all.

I even had someone tried to open my door at 4AM but the ring just alert me as motion detected ( I set it up at highest sensitive), and it took over a minute for the live-view to be active, and after I heard the noise I have to went down, checked the window and yelled at the burglar to make him ran away ( police reported ). And I’m seriously thinking about cancel my subscription with Ring and move on to another service.","updated":"2020-10-22T12:46:18-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=926252661&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"6157270968","userName":"Vanessa C.

We just checked the footage this morning for a timeline of events and LITERALLY, the footage stops recording after the first 30 seconds and goes to taking photos.

Second, there are always delays and frequently “can’t connect to Ring” errors, especially when a camera’s motion goes off. Clicking the motion notifications causes the app to endlessly connect to the camera and never loads. You either have to force close the app, or keep pressing “live view” and the red “end” button to see video feed. The app in general also runs slow.

I think it would be really nice to schedule when the motion zones are active, not just when alerts are sent. For example, turn off the motion zones during the weekend day time when there is a lot of in and out from your front door. That way, it doesn’t log a bunch of you and your family and friends coming and going.

All my cameras are on wired Ethernet and I don’t have the same issue with Nest, so the problem is with Ring’s servers/processing. Also, it would be great if the motion alerts included the video so that I can quickly review and dismiss (another feature Nest has that Ring does not).

In the age of AI, Big Data and facial recognition technology, it’s absolutely inexcusable that your software does not have a feature to exclude/hide/not record certain people. I DO NOT need 500 videos of ME leaving from and returning to my place. I shouldn’t have to snooze notifications just because I’m cleaning or hanging out on my porch.\n\nSince I usually have my phone on, near me, you should at least say, we’ll record it but stick it in a folder called Probably unimportant and delete it after so many days.  Or we won’t record at all (allow us to choose). I can see arguments about recording should someone sneak up and assault me.\n\nAllow me to train the app to exclude other “known and ok” people/household neighbors.\n\nSo I can focus on the bad ones. But as it is, this camera, app and system has been more useless than useful. The novelty of reviewing video alerts has quickly worn off when it’s me 98% of the time.","updated":"2020-01-19T15:52:03-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=926252661&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"4901407176","userName":"Janky326","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id140825807","version":"5.18.3","score":3,"title":"Weird streaming while live","text":"I have the Ring wired outdoor camera and when going live (whenever it does allow me), it streams but image starts deteriorating gradually to the point that you can hardly identify what you are looking at.

The  doorbell is the first edition and is incredibly slow at notifications. Most times all you see is someone walking away. It also lacks night vision, so identifying someone at night is practically useless. The floodlight camera has a beautiful picture and is faster at notifications. You cannot, however set the motion lights to not activate during a certain time. It’s either on, off or motion activated. Also, you cannot sync between devices. You have to manually enter each device on your phone, iPad, and computer even though I’m signed into my account.

If it had sad card back up in case the WiFi goes out that would be awesome. Sometimes the motion does nor go off until the motion event is over. The WiFi on theses cameras are exceptionally weak but we added WiFi repeaters in the house to alleviate this problem. We still feel this is the best outdoor system. The price for monthly service is reasonable and the servers are zippy. In internet goes out then your security is DEAD!! 🤢 I guess the engineers did not think his through. We use a T-Mobile hotspot as our back up internet. An sd card slot would help.

By the time you can get past the spinning wheel opening the app the person is long gone. The latest update renders the night vision a green grainy view that’s awful and would be of no use in identifying anyone. Why this was changed I have no clue, the black and white night view was at least somewhat acceptable. I’ve had this several months, hardwired to my doorbell. It stopped ringing the bell, was told I needed a bigger transformer. Spent $30 and luckily am handy enough to install or it would have been more. Then told to add a wifi booster to help with the latency. Now the doorbell won’t ring again and the latency delay no better despite $100 in extra expense. Luckily I got the Ring at the warehouse club and they’ll still take it back. Concept is great but execution is terrible.","updated":"2018-07-22T18:33:00-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=926252661&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"8020682108","userName":"We are the music makers","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id85407965","version":"5.45.0","score":3,"title":"Great for recording visitors, poor for checking immediately.","text":"The good first: it does seem to reliably capture footage whenever someone comes around so you can review it later, which is a nice security feature.\n\nTakes a minute to connect to the doorbell, which kind of defeats the purpose of the whole system since you want to see who’s knocking quickly, but end up just going to the door anyway rather than waiting on the app.\n\nThe constant badgering to set up two-factor authentication every time you try to use the app was what really got under my skin.

I have had it for a year now, have called customer service several times, researched you tube videos, even updated our router to a much “stronger” wifi range and paying much more for it, yet still the ring barely catches anything.  We had so idiots put a mattress on our front lawn and the ring didn’t pick it up!!! Yeah, the cops were real impressed in our security system. When it does pick up people it’s on a major delay.  The person is typically in the house or out of the range for us to see.     The battery dies way too often, especially if we get more company in a month then previous.  It takes a year and a day for me to see what is going on because it is always telling me that the WiFi signal is low or there is none.  It’s ridiculous. So frustrating.
