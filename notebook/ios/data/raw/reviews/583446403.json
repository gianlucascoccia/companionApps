I had an Apple watch for a minute and quickly discovered that it couldn’t do what my garmin did, so the Apple Watch went back and the Venu sq was purchased. Still trying to decide if i love the Venu Sq, as the Forerunner was so much simpler to use, but the Venu provides so much data that i love, like stress tracking, O2, etc. \nI really wish the Venu had more exercise options like HIIT or “functional”strength training. The strength training option from Garmin is frustrating with the reps, just simply time my workout. \nI wish setting up my walk/run intervals while running was simpler than going into another menu. Why isn’t that option there when i go into run? I can’t seem to figure out how to pause a run. Does it auto pause? What happens when i have to wait at a traffic light? \nCan i scroll through my text messages. Some just show half a message. Why can’t i scroll down? The watch just isn’t very intuitive. I’ll keep reading the manual, but i think improvements could be made. If there wasn’t so much other data that i like, i would be tempted to go back to my Forerunner. 🤔","updated":"2021-01-08T18:50:42-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=583446403&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5372451192","userName":"Mr. Terrarian","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id319397113","version":"4.25.2","score":5,"title":"Garmin in General","text":"I recently purchased a Garmin Forerunner 235, and I enjoy everything about it! It is so useful. It is lightweight, tells you your heartbeat, your VO2 max, recovery time, your aerobic training, and more. I didn’t realize all of the features I wanted were on the watch (there is no swimming, but I don’t really care). The app is what makes the watch so cool, and it makes it easy to see your mileage. Also, there are badges that you can get, and it makes the workouts feel like a game sometimes, trying to earn the badges. My mom now really wants one of these watches. I guess the downsides are that the watch dies after around three days, with you recording a workout session in all three days that last for around an hour. I don’t know how accurate the Garmin watch is, but I’m just glad that the features are there, because if I wanted more accuracy I would need to go and make myself uncomfortable for the day (heart rate while sleeping, deep and light sleep tracker, heart rate while running, etc). Sometimes it’s uncomfortable after wearing the watch snug for a couple of days. The “move!” Thing on the watch is a little annoying, but the pros outweigh the cons by far, and you even might be able to disable it. \n\nAll in all, this is a great brand, and if you are obsessed with health and working out, I would recommend this brand for a lot of people. I got my watch on Black Friday for $150, and I don’t regret it at all.","updated":"2020-01-07T06:58:58-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=583446403&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"6148572234","userName":"Koopz23","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id261118439","version":"4.32","score":5,"title":"Watches are great, app is good","text":"I use the Garmin Fenix 6 and I could not recommend it more.

The graphs are often annoying because I have not found out how to choose a point on the graph to see a value, you can only see the trend roughly plotted and guess (this goes for paces from your runs and also things like your heart rate throughout the night). I also find the calendar view largely useless, especially when compared to something like Apple’s activity rings. Don’t get me wrong though, the data Garmin provides is second to none, but largely a function of which watch you have purchased.\n\nIn summary, Garmin provides as accurate and useful of info as any company does in the sports watch realm, but could stand to improve accessibility and aesthetics for some of that data in the app.","updated":"2020-07-02T07:08:17-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=583446403&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5084574606","userName":"regretting i bought this","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id143461769","version":"4.24.1","score":2,"title":"Used 2 garmin products and over them","text":"I have a vivoactive 3  for 1.5 yrs.

As an example, I’ve been religiously using “training status” every day for two years to monitor the relationship between my 7-day training load and my target load (based on integrated firstbeat tables), making training adjustments on the fly... Now, when I open the app, all those brilliantly helpful, adjustable, overlaid charts are gone—they have literally been replaced by a colored icon that says, “Productive.” That icon changes in response to training each day, but I can no longer view the data that underlies it on the fly, rendering this potentially valuable source of insight meaningless within the app.\n\nDev team: you’ve had two years here.

Supposedly, according to the Garmin website, the sleep and wake times that you key in are fixed in that even if you take a nap any recorded data would be in ADDITION to what was computed overnight. Wrong. I took a 2+ hour nap and the data OVERWROTE my overnight sleep. Which is very frustrating when the data is being used for tracking purposes.

Typically, if I ride and burn 2000 calories, GC will tell my iPhone health app that I’ve burned 4000, even though it’s showing 2000 in GC. \nIf you’re a garmin fan like me, this app is a must have for stats tracking.

I have a new Fitbit when this one dies to wear that I won at work.

The training metrics are shown on the 530 which are correct but Connect is somehow not in sync with the metrics even though the rides are uploading.

However, I am NOT a tech savvy person, so if I can figure it out, I’m sure anyone can. \n\nOne thing I’d like to see added has to do with the ability to add gear to activities. Most of my hiking is done with a backpack and I’d love to be able to log how much weight I carry on each hike. Right now I can add a backpack as “other” gear, but all it tracks is that gear’s mileage. Logging mileage on a backpack doesn’t seem that useful. \n\nAnother issue I think has to do with my Garmin Instinct rather than the app. When doing a hiking activity, the heart rate recorded is substantially lower than what it should be. I’ve done significant climbs when I can feel my heart trying to beat out of my chest, but my watch says I’m at a nice, easy 80 bpm. The issue only seems to happen during hiking - the other activities seem fine. \n\nOverall, I’m very happy with the app. It’s been a good motivation to keep me physically active and to keep trying to “beat yesterday,” as Garmin puts it.","updated":"2020-02-03T07:53:46-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=583446403&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"4304690464","userName":"Felix8338","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id301399427","version":"4.19.1","score":4,"title":"Brilliant data","text":"I have owned the Fenix 2, Apple Watch 4th generation and now the Fenix 5x plus.

When you manually enter activities, it comes up with the outlandish calculations which by the way, overwrite your data if you try to fix it.

When I contacted support, I was told they had received numerous complaints about the new format for annual data and were going to correct it. Well, with the last update they extended the new annual formatting to other data segments. They’re not fixing it, they’re just extending this horrible concept. What is the point of giving them my data if they can’t show it to me in a format that is useful? At least give the option to customize how to view the data, that would be an upgrade. Once my 935 has reached the end of its useful life, I’m definitely not going to be buying another Garmin.","updated":"2021-03-18T09:52:13-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=583446403&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"7001665514","userName":"And Another Unhappy User","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id340374768","version":"4.39","score":1,"title":"Doesn’t sync- have to manually sync","text":"This app works fine as an app but to use it in conjunction with a garmin watch you have to manually sync it through your computer or disconnect/forget the device through Bluetooth and reconnect- this happens daily.
