I had a slight problem setting it up there was slight differences in the LED color that the directions explained versus what the actual color was for the setup process (the camera has an LED that can display in different colors). The live feed for me is only off by about a second or two off (not too bad). When I’m home I turn the camera off but there seems to be a delay when I turn it back on before it reconnects (about 3-4 minutes or so). There again, for the price I paid I thought it was well worth the small investment and I’m pretty pleased. I would recommend this product.","updated":"2019-12-08T18:16:23-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=464234175&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"2211361902","userName":"robyn280","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id106563724","version":"2.14.0","score":4,"title":"Works","text":"System works well and customer assistance is helpful.

But if I leave the app on in the background, then the video/audio will continue when I shut off the screen. As I mentioned, I use this as a baby monitor.

And it is also very noisy. Even if no one is at home, and the house is pinned silent, it still makes a lot of notice not sure from where!!!\nSetting up was not easy because if you have cable internet, it does not work with any wifi other than 2.4 ghz. \nNight vision is horrible, you basically do not see a thing but very blurry shadow. \nYou can buy some 15-20 dollar wifi webcam and it serves the same quality like this one. \nBottom line is, if you want to spend this much money you should consider other brands. Their customer support is from Russia and the agents are very rude.","updated":"2016-12-14T10:58:59-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=464234175&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1379262895","userName":"MightyMouse1953","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id266653124","version":"2.5.1","score":4,"title":"No advanced technical knowledge needed","text":"Both the camera and the app were easy to set up and share with my husband.

I set mine to always use low because the drops outs and lag were so bad.  Despite this, it still appears to try to optimize the image resolution.  It then drops out when an event occurs as it buffers and reduces the quality.   So you neither hear not see the triggering event.  \n3) The persistent audio feature doesn't work consistently.  Sometimes it turns off as soon as the display shuts off (I found pushing the app to the background before turning off the display sometimes helps this). Sometimes it turns off when it has a lag event.  And finally sometimes it will work for hours and then shut off at an unknown time in the middle of the night leaving you in a panic over the health of your newborn that you were listening to. \n\nI believe a couple of the issues are:\n1) The fact that all of the data collected from the cameras must be uploaded to ivideon's servers and then streamed to the device.  This might make sense for remote access, but not if both devices are on the same network.  It is hugely inefficient and simply doesn't work as implemented.  \n2) The previously mentioned attempt by the app to always use the maximum image resolution.  The advertised image quality just isn't supportable as currently implemented.  \n\nI am running this on iPhone 5s, with an always up to date OS.  I have an Asus RT-AC66U gigabit router running on Xfinity cable internet in a suburb. There should be no bandwidth issues in this signal chain.  \n\nAs the title says, this app is not useful as a baby monitor.  I will keep looking for a better implementation of the concepts attempted by this app.","updated":"2015-10-15T17:57:43-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=464234175&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1095573187","userName":"Dajokoy","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id272634913","version":"2.0.0","score":5,"title":"Love it...","text":"Great App!","updated":"2014-11-11T17:03:03-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=464234175&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"811902538","userName":"Jprzekop","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id104900654","version":"1.1.0","score":4,"title":"Review","text":"Awesome","updated":"2013-05-28T13:45:01-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=464234175&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"948366939","userName":"Joenegron","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id374929573","version":"1.3.0","score":5,"title":"Great !!!!","text":"Nice","updated":"2014-02-22T10:56:28-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=464234175&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1383370216","userName":"Dima2014","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id114875178","version":"2.5.1","score":4,"title":"Хорошее приложение","text":"Спасибо за приложение, очень облегчило жизнь.
