Problem is when I check events it only records a few seconds at a time and does not get the things I need like a break in or my dog breaking out of her kennel and destroying everything in the house from her anxiety when alone. Conversations or theft. It will record light changing as the day goes on or if my cat comes in the room. But only in seconds not minutes. It also does not record in color as stated and does not get close up to faces. I have them located in every room and upsets me that the audio really doesn’t work much either. \nSometimes it is not available and I have to reset it when I get home. But when at work I cannot see what’s going on if it decides it doesn’t allow me to click on that camera. \nI like it when it works but wish it was in color most of the time. Please fix these problems or I will have to upgrade to new cameras.","updated":"2018-09-19T06:18:46-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=498122294&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"3025340617","userName":"ma02121977","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id234434940","version":"3.4.6","score":2,"title":"Camera is OK but could be MUCH better","text":"This camera is OK but has many issues. This camera constantly loses Internet connection. To reset it to your phone has to be in the house. So when you are away, and need the camera, when it loses connection, you cannot fix it until you are home. Defeats the purpose! The communication on this camera has a very heavy delay. If you were trying to talk to somebody that is home, the delay is approximately five seconds. Meaning, the people at home (most likely children) need to wait five seconds before they answer you. No child, even a teenager, remembers to do this. It is extremely frustrating on both ends. I would definitely look into another camera.","updated":"2018-08-06T04:32:07-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=498122294&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"2257188069","userName":"Doggymama76","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id202036835","version":"3.4.6","score":3,"title":"Good quality","text":"The reason I got the camera I did was because it came with free 24 hour recording.

My problem is the recording; I guess since it’s free service you can’t complain but it’s so sporadic that it doesn’t always capture what you think it will. It is catching the changes in light and some sounds, like when my heater comes on because it’s blowing over the camera. But yet when my dog got a hold of my shoe it totally skipped recording that. Very disappointing, but my dog appreciated that. So even when it records, it’s in few second sections so the whole time my dog was spewing trash around the house, I only got the last of it as evidence.\nLately it is not letting me log in right away I have to close the app and open it again sometimes a couple times before it logs me in.","updated":"2018-02-28T14:24:29-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=498122294&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"2268932137","userName":"cardanne3","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id705382860","version":"3.4.6","score":1,"title":"Don’t buy a camera that uses this app!!","text":"The app offers 24 hour storage.
