My reason for choosing the model I did the Steel HR was for heart rate and sleep tracking and here is where I am constantly feeling somewhat disappointed. I love this feature and the HR monitoring seems to do well. The sleep tracker however needs some major improvements, when it’s working it’s fantastic but you can’t really track sleep if it doesn’t even pick up you’ve slept 2 or 3 nights a week OR doesn’t record sleep activity until after the first time you’ve gotten out of bed to use the bathroom at 2 am. I’ve looked at all the fixes and reasons this might occur and none of them make sense to me. I don’t shake my arm wildly after I get into bed and often wake 3-4 hours after going to sleep in the same position I fell asleep, yet the tracker does not record. More frustrating is when it fails to record a night at all. It keeps record of my sleep heart rate, why is it not giving me sleep data? So I love it’s sleek design, it’s exercise features, and much of what they are trying to do but it’s more a a parlor game then a health gadget at this time. It does have a clock and the ability to get notifications is a huge plus.

Shame on you, Nokia.\n\nEdit: if you are a new user, steer clear of this app and all of Nokia's products that go with it. \n\nI am still regretting choosing withings over FitBit when I bought 2 scales and 2 watches. I was a happy camper with withings and it's awesome app until Nokia came along and ruined features and functionality in one sweep, offering nothing in return.\n\nNokia has improved its app with the latest update, and users are starting to acknowledge it, but let's not forget that it is still missing functionality and features that were already present and working in the past; that is: this has been a step forward, but right after 200 steps back, so you are still 199 behind. \nSimply own your massive misstep and give us the old app back, that is he right thing to do. To continue pushing your ridiculous decisions down your customers throats is never going to work. \n\nAre you going to do the right thing?!?!","updated":"2017-11-02T06:20:16-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=542701020&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"6281265346","userName":"peedeesee","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id31315140","version":"5.0.1","score":2,"title":"Don’t you hate bored developers?","text":"This app has never been a star, but it did what I needed it to do - report on my activity.
