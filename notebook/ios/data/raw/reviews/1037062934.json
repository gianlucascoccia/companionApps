For working parents and those who can‚Äôt sit next to their kids 24/7, it‚Äôs nice to have a tool that allows one to filter content and limit access to non-educational sites such as games and video/television (especially during class time) and to enforce off-screen and bed times.  \n\nThe issues I have with this app arise when there is need for kids to access content that has been filtered or access a computer beyond an allowed time frame. It takes a little research and tinkering to figure out why a certain application or webpage is being blocked. For example, the app will notify if kids have exceeded screen time parameters, but it does not notify if content is being blocked because of bedtime or off time access parameters. (Sometimes more than one blocking parameter is causative.) The app will alert kids if content is being filtered, but it takes a real sleuth to figure out what filter parameter is being triggered. When I don‚Äôt have the time to play Sherlock Holmes and dig through history, it‚Äôs just easier to temporarily disable everything, which defeats the purpose of having this app.  \n\nIn conclusion, I wish the app would tell me specifically what and why something is being blocked and easily allow me to override the block as needed.","updated":"2020-09-11T11:39:14-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1037062934&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5831261060","userName":"toddrub","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id8901845","version":"2.1.8","score":2,"title":"Latest Circle Bedtime Server Crash leaves Devices invisible.","text":"We have had Circle for less than four months, and it was used in conjunction with our new Netgear routerÔøº model R7960 Tri-Band.

Reading the reviews from teenagers who are angry it exists is proof it works. We have a NetGear router that came with Circle integration.  Our speed has not been impacted in the slightest. Our oldest son is a gamer and he does not experience any lag. We ran speed tests between our current and old router, and even with Circle, the new router is actually faster (routers were fairly similar, we upgraded for Circle). We discussed the limits we were imposing with our kids when we set it up (bedtimes, age appropriate content filter, etc.). The only times our kids even know we have circle is when they are doing something that is against our family rules. If they are following the rules, it doesn‚Äôt have anything to block. When I was a teenager, I thought I knew it all too and I didn‚Äôt agree with the rules my parents had for me, but as an adult, I understand. If we don‚Äôt fight for our kids‚Äô purity and equip them to chose to be self-controlled, this world will continue to devour their minds and creativity. In my opinion, Circle as surveillance is too far, but Circle is great for establishing and enforcing boundaries for screen time.","updated":"2020-06-01T21:47:08-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1037062934&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"6749223524","userName":"Crazy Heart x6","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id141339338","version":"2.1.11","score":1,"title":"Rating update","text":"As I continued to use this service, I have realized that it‚Äôs simply garbage.

The product is set to be integrated with a smartphone and this app. Setup is easy with set by step graphic prompts and only takes minutes to set up eith several machines, enabling the ability to manage sets of internet connected device and even monitor the website usage of certain sets on age based contents. You can monitor / filter types of websites, control internet traffic to certain machines, and even set up time limits (which i still have try the last one.)\n\nI am docking 2 stars because tracking and website filtering functions on the app abruptly stopped working. I went to their website and followed the initial steps to solve the problem and it didnt help - rebooting the router, reinstalling the software, etc. This didnt help. I contacted Circle‚Äôs customer service, and they said they couldnt help and directed me to contact Netgear. Netgear is meticulous in th help they give, but reaching them is hard and getting a case number in their systems is not quick. After 2 days of trial an error, it was determined that the app was not compatible with the 0.98 firmware update that I was initally required to install upon setup of my router. (Beware this update, RAX200 customers.) While this issue resta more with Netgear, Circle should have known this too and notified customers automatically to keep them informed.\n\nSo that‚Äôs why I docked 1 star. The second star I docked because of an experience that came up few days ago. I was having the same issue with website monitoring functionality going away. The app was acting up again, and to be clear, it was not tracking website history of machines I had setup to be observed and block online gaming from (on school days.) I went back to Circle‚Äôs  website to see if there was anything else I could do and did what i could at the time, delete and reinstall the app as advised. That was yesterday, and i had to wait this morning to follow up and reboot my router (because it was too busy on our WiFi for school, work, etc.) Upon rebooting, and around 15 or so minutes, the Circle App was working again. Becaue this second error happened, I questioned the stability of the app and looked for more information on the website. I had found that the problems I had overlapped with the timesc that 2 updates happened for the app for bug fixes. That is frustrsting to hear and I find should‚Äôve been disclosed by the company. I feel Circle‚Äôs support system is lacking for the 1st Generation version of the app. Monitor updates when your app stops working.

But for those who want to see a formal review of this concept in the perspective of the child, keep reading. \n\nThe idea of circle is understandable, as all parents should be concerned about what their children are doing online and should protect them from the horrible aspects that the internet can provide. But the fact that parents are spending their money on a network device that blocks out house WiFi (and cellular service) which they‚Äôre ALSO paying for is considered acceptable and convenient? I don‚Äôt see how this logically connects to every necessary part of the situation. \nI don‚Äôt see how I‚Äôll be able to contact my parents during a serious emergency while on the go if my internet is paused.\nI don‚Äôt see how I‚Äôll be able to complete all my online school work if my parents have an ‚Äúall categories‚Äù limit set to 3 hours(I‚Äôve tried talking to them about that, they just give me a 15 minute reward over and over which wastes all of our time. Lots of parents are passive-aggressive like mine). \nI don‚Äôt see how the whole mechanism is going to work, if I‚Äôm spending my HARD EARNED money on cellular data, and they‚Äôre just gonna spend THEIR money to block it out. \nYeah, the whole situation just wasn‚Äôt completely thought out by the developers. It is a brilliant idea to help protect children, but the whole thing just isn‚Äôt very convenient for the whole party. \nAlso, circle just shouldn‚Äôt be necessary for kids older than the age of 16, since they‚Äôll be a legal adult in just <2 years and they‚Äôll have to figure out how to manage their own screen time by themselves eventually.\n\nParents, if you‚Äôre planning on getting yourself this network-killing device, please take a moment to look at yourself, how your relationship with your children will be, and if it‚Äôs going to be beneficial for EVERY part of their life(including online school!). Please be aware that your children will feel punished, and will cause trust issues between you guys. \nIf your children have some screen time problems right now, I would deeply imply having a friendly conversation with them about it first before surprising them with a restriction right out of the blue. It‚Äôs like trying to quit smoking cold-turkey(not like they‚Äôre actually smoking, just take it as a simile). As a teenager who has experience with parents who ghostly put restrictions on me whenever they want without telling me, it‚Äôs a bit traumatizing. \nBut, if you‚Äôre a good parent and your kids know it, and putting restrictions for them is necessary, and all your limits you provide them are fully thought out, \nOR, \nyour children are just utterly psychotic and won‚Äôt get their eyes off a screen for less than 10 hours a day, then go ahead and get Circle.\n\nBut please, be careful. I‚Äôm saying this for the sake of the kids :c","updated":"2021-08-14T18:36:10-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1037062934&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"4999778389","userName":"Bub Hungry","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id895320011","version":"2.1.6","score":1,"title":"SLOW","text":"This is very slow.

This makes setup very difficult when you're trying to identify devices. \nIssues after setup:\n1. Circle will say my son has used three hours of Internet when he hadn't used any (was asleep). AND\n2. For usage it will often just list numbers what look like IP addresses. When you click on the \"visit website\" link it doesn't work. So no way to know this supposed Internet usage.

The MyCircle app also gives kids an app in which to monitor themselves.  I have only 2 complaints.  1) the monthly subscription of $5 beyond the $90 for the device and 2) for devices like the computer it only monitors the computer as a whole not each account on the computer.  So if a parent wants to use the computer they would be using the 'allotted' time given to the teenager.  True you can just change it to 'uncategorized' then change it back but that is not a smooth transition.  There are several areas which the company promises to improve but for my needs it works really well.

Schools often use a VPN to ensure control over safe browsing.  When this happens not only can do you lose control over app content (which I understand based on how VPNs work) but you also lose the ability to control screen time.

The kids are using all sorts off apps that aren‚Äôt identified in the filter.  When you go to ‚ÄúUsage‚Äù you‚Äôll find the bulk of the time is in the ‚Äúuncategorized‚Äù section with only an IP address to identify it.  A good example is Amino which is a community app with some really questionable content.  I‚Äôm sure most folks don‚Äôt know how to run a WHOIS command to track this down.  And even then it‚Äôs often uninformative.  Suggest Circle hires a couple folks to look at the top uncategorized sites and capture the content so we know the app that is associated to the IP address.  Many of these addresses now go to a company that builds/operates apps for their clients.   As such much of the information you would want from the app isn‚Äôt there.  As a parent you are left blind on the bulk of internet usage.

I found a more effective way to teach my children life skills. When I feel they should take a break then I give them ideas of what to do, this helps them learn to be entertained in a different way. There should also be a partner app for the kids so they can monitor how much time they have and can use it wisely. Third, my kids often have schoolwork online, and who wants to waste WiFi time for fun stuff on homework. They often try to do it really quickly, skipping on quality. If i allow them to do their homework later they sometimes have already run out of time. The filter and tracking is the only thing i don‚Äôt hate, besides the fact that it is very glitchy and wrong.

They even go so far as to pretend to be adults or ‚Äúnetwork experts‚Äù. I am a relatively tech savvy adult and love this product. It is made quite well and simple to use, and gives great reporting on usage. I am sure it is not a perfect product, but when talking about privacy and security nothing is perfect.","updated":"2019-01-22T05:43:34-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1037062934&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"3908958593","userName":"SactoJ","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id20196858","version":"2.1.1","score":4,"title":"Losing connection","text":"Love the app overall. Biggest ongoing problem is that occasionally the app loses connection to my Circle enabled router when I am away from my house.  At that point I lose control of the router and cannot reconnect until I get home.  For example right now I am away from my home for two days.  I turned off internet to my son‚Äôs devices for a while. The the Circle lost the connection. Now I can‚Äôt turn it back on until I get home tomorrow night.  This is a serious problem.","updated":"2019-03-21T11:10:51-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1037062934&type=Purple%20Software"}]
