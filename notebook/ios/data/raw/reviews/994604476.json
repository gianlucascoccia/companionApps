It wouldn’t be a problem if we could combine areas in software, or even queue a series (eg, “Hallway, mud room, breakfast area”), but that isn’t possible either. Since cleaning times can vary depending on barriers posed by toys and pets, the schedule has to be looser than it needs to be, meaning that time is wasted returning to base, or worse, skipping the area if the previous job runs long.

Just about every time I run the Botvac D7 it says my floor plan does not match even though everything is in the same place. So the botvac starts up then goes back to the base. Funny thing is if I try to add a new app it says “wait this new map is too similar to an existing one”. Really? Because you didn’t recognize it as matching when I tried to actually vacuum.
