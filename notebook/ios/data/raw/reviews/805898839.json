Unmatched, period!","text":"I purchased two of the second-generation bulbs; one Edison, and one par, and after attempting to download the app on my iPad-even though it's an iPhone only app - I was very discouraged to read that everyone has had so much trouble with the app that I changed my mind and decided to return the bulbs.  Plus, I couldn't get the app to work on my iPad Air 2 at all and it just said a new app is coming.\n\nSuddenly I remembered why I purchased the bulbs in the first place, which was because of the display, and the display didn't have an app.  So for the heck of it, I decided to try the Edison bulb.  I then downloaded the app on my iPhone 6plus.\n\nYes, the app is extremely rudimentary, but a couple years ago the app would've been considered awesome as hell.  So I decided to be patient.  Immediately the bulb connected to the app. I didn't have to do any sort of search or anything.\n\nThe colors of blue are marvelous!!! I can't find any bulb on the market that emits this color of blue!!! \n\nThen I started using the app to change the colors, and I found yellows and oranges that I've never found on other bulbs on the market either - this includes the Hue bulbs.  \n\nI work in the film industry, and these bulbs are just exquisite, and I can see a vast use for them on film sets. Hear that iLumi?!?  Yes, read my email to ya'll!\n\nThe bulb is heavy and well-built, and I'm hoping that it will last a very long time. So if you really like a vast array of colors, you will love this bulb. There's no doubt in my mind. You just have to fiddle around with the app to get the color you want, but you will get the color that you want!  That's what's amazing about this bulb.  I actually matched the bulb color of blue to the color of blue on my wall, and I absolutely couldn't believe it. Color correcting a bulb to match the color on the wall? That's really unheard of.\n\nSo before you change your mind about getting this bulb because of the app, try the bulb first. Play with the colors. I haven't tried any other feature on the app, but at this point I don't need to. I'm already crazy about this bulb, and if a new app is ever developed, then that will just be a bonus.","updated":"2015-12-12T16:53:47-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=805898839&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1103059752","userName":"Fireryan","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id20217120","version":"1.8","score":1,"title":"Uggg","text":"Turned my $80 lightbulb into a $3. \n\nStill waiting on call back from support","updated":"2014-11-25T10:10:48-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=805898839&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1245352706","userName":"Trage56","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id37535688","version":"2.0","score":1,"title":"Stopped working","text":"I can't connect to my bulb anymore.","updated":"2015-08-19T02:23:10-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=805898839&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1365602855","userName":"Chadleit","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id493535931","version":"2.5.1","score":2,"title":"Buggy & low budget app","text":"Love the functionality of the bulb and what it's capable of. I personally own 7, but the app makes them feel almost worthless. Now with the music feature, awesome idea but lacks the major support of LARGE third-party apps like Spotify and Pandora. Next is the overall performance of the app, I've noticed that sometimes the bulbs fail to communicate with what I'm trying to control within the app. For example, when I swipe all off, only five bulbs will turn off in my bathroom and bedroom. You just have to swipe again to turn them all on again, then hope that when you swipe all off again, they will actually all turn off. It's inconveniences like these that make the Philips HUE bulb worth the extra penny for a more worthy app that contains less bugs AND more functionality. Hope to see an update soon!","updated":"2016-04-19T01:00:17-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=805898839&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1303731115","userName":"danthemanbaker","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id223574517","version":"2.3.1","score":4,"title":"A bright review","text":"Unlike other reviewers, I have had a nearly flawless experience with the app. I purchased 14 bulbs from ilumi's most recent Kickstarter campaign. They all synced up immediately without difficulty.\n    I struggled at first with the interface of the app but quickly found solutions after reading ilumi's FAQ page and doing some quick google searching. For example: initially, whenever I turned my light switch off and back on again some of the bulbs on that circuit would revert back to a different color than what they were just on. I thought this was a problem with the hardware or software, but I found out how to set a \"default\" color for each bulb. In playing with my settings when I first got my bulbs, I had unknowingly set different defaults for many bulbs. Fixing the default colors fixed my headaches. \n    Pros:\n    I use the sunrise feature as an alarm and it works great. \n    Scenes work very well and I can immediately change the mood of my whole house by pushing one preset. \n     I contacted customer service when I increased the number of bulbs on my order, they were extremely fast in replying and very helpful.\n     Lights are easily grouped and renaming bulbs makes it easy to maintain specific control.\n     Showing them off is fun, I made my whole family jealous.\n    Cons:\n     Sometimes bulbs can be sluggish to sync when changing multiple bulbs at once.\n     Music app is difficult to figure out, I have trouble selecting a specific song to play,and making a playlist is seemingly not possible now. (Although it looks freaking cool when it does work)\n     Bulbs do not dim on a dimmer switch. 100% power is needed for their connectivity, they are only dimmable from the app. (Luckily I knew this before I ordered them, otherwise it would have been a big letdown)\n\nDespite these cons I highly recommend the bulbs and this app to control them. I believe a new, updated app is in the works as they mentioned in their Kickstarter campaign.","updated":"2015-12-20T20:53:35-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=805898839&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1530674765","userName":"MashaT22","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id44047985","version":"2.5.1","score":1,"title":"Discontinuing?!","text":"I am awarding 1-star because I don't agree that this first app should be pulled from the App Store. I find it odd that this original ilumi app is being discontinued being that the newer app has major issues with connectivity, stability, UI, and the overall UX. When you look at all of the recent reviews for the newer app, it becomes clear that there's a widespread problem that is not sporadic. This app has had its problems as well, but at least its been generally possible to control the bulbs and set timers most of the time. The new app is completely useless to mostly everyone, but at least this one somewhat works -- not ideal, but somewhat is better than useless. I don't think it's the right time to force people to a completely non-functioning app when this one still works enough for many people to keep using their bulbs in some fashion via an app.\n\nI think it would help if ilumi would start a user beta testing group. Oftentimes it's difficult to identify hardware and/or software problems outside of a company's building without having real world use-cases from which to obtain data, bug reports, general feedback, etc. Perhaps some experienced beta testers, under more realistic conditions (i.e. your customer's homes, offices, etc.), can provide crucial feedback that the team evidently needs to develop the app your ilumi supporters clearly deserve. I personally have 19 years of hardware/software beta experience and would happily volunteer to help test via TestFlight (or a similar iOS beta platform), and I'm sure others would do the same if you were to ask. I backed your most recent campaign for the light strips and happened to inherit the standard bulbs brand new in the boxes from my brother (who backed the first campaign) when he decided to adopt another bulb platform while waiting to receive his ilumi rewards. There are lots of people who believe in this company and want to help, so please consider it everyone's thoughts.\n\nPersonally, I think it makes sense to scrap the newer app that's apparently unusable, leave this old app alone for now albeit its limits, and then start working on developing a totally brand new app from scratch. Your hardware is quite nice, but us early adopters are sadly not getting our money's worth with all these app issues. It's such a shame that your app development doesn't seem to be working out. Whatever the issues, please explain the details more clearly via Kickstarter updates and know that we still support you -- but it's getting difficult for many people to stay patient when the product just hasn't been working because of several failed app development attempts (I'm admittedly far too patient, lol). If I can help with beta testing or anything else, please send me a DM on Twitter (@MashaT22) or a private message through Kickstarter.","updated":"2017-01-25T21:53:26-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=805898839&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1298785623","userName":"Asian krchanker","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id112311685","version":"2.3.1","score":1,"title":"Fix pls","text":"The app keeps crashing","updated":"2015-12-10T15:35:28-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=805898839&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1340286677","userName":"ButtaBabyy","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id155025242","version":"2.4","score":1,"title":"Blahüòí","text":"App doesn't sync and keeps crashing.","updated":"2016-02-28T15:57:20-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=805898839&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1335619099","userName":"UltimateIndy","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id379029362","version":"2.4","score":1,"title":"Crappy as hell","text":"See above","updated":"2016-02-19T17:31:17-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=805898839&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1298365044","userName":"brentanhorn","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id29584585","version":"2.3.1","score":1,"title":"Nice Hardware Abysmal Software","text":"Software update please!!
