What an awesome sound from the ue ROLL 2. I just purchased my second ue ROLL 2 and after pairing them together I couldn't believe the sound coming out of those little speakers. The sound quality is comparable to the Bose wave radio. So why not five stars you might ask, well it took me about three tries to get the two speakers to pair. So maybe and update would improve the reliability of pairing the two speakers quicker. Another feature that would be nice, would be, if I could film a video on my phone while the music's playing. I have the iPhone 6s Plus, as soon as I turn on the camera, The music stops playing. I suppose this is to prevent conflicts with the microphone on my phone. Would it be possible for the \"ue Roll app\" to add a feature where the microphone on my phone could be temporarily switched off while taking a video? Overall I think it's a wonderful app and a great product.","updated":"2016-09-10T10:42:46-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=987657806&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1617268047","userName":"Iknowyouare","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id36544461","version":"1.8","score":1,"title":"Disappointed","text":"Love my UE Boom 2 so was thrilled when I was given a UE Roll 2 for Mother's day .. well first we discover that we can't \"double up\" a boom with a roll!
