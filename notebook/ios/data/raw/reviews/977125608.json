About 3 months ago the app inexplicably lost connection; tech support’s response was to ask me to send them a video of me going through the steps. It’s a little hard to do since the camera is part of the phone that has the app but I suppose I could ask someone to do the recording. \nBut that’s besides the point. That’s not a viable solution, it’s taking a pass. I’ve followed the instructions repeatedly and I’ve gotten nowhere; the app fails to connect, never progressing beyond 0% even after 20 minutes of processing. There’s no alternate way to troubleshoot, and I’m just expected to repeat the process ad nauseum, which I believe I’ve reached. I’m done. It’s a shame, the device is poorly supported but when it works it’s great.

It crashes frequently, particularly during device setup which makes configuring lights unbearable. It can eventually setup most devices, but it will take many tries.\n\niOS also tends to intercept the setup and offers to setup HomeKit devices directly in HomeKit, which usually works well. Yeelight will then prompt to add devices from HomeKit, but this always fails. The result is some lights can only be controlled via HomeKit and often get colors wrong when set to dim.\n\nOverall, the app is somewhat required and does eventually work. But it’s so unreliable it’s hard to give this a decent rating.\n\nUpdate: downgrading from 2 stars to 1 star because after multiple updates of “bug fixes” since my last review, the app is still just an unreliable. Setup of new devices is still awful. I have a light bulb that desperately needs a firmware update, but the app never successfully installs it.
