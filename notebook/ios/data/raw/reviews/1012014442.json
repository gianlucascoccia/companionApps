Even with some of its quirks (it’ll miss certain areas within a specific cleaning map and often will clean areas outside of a specific cleaning map + add that area to the cleaning map without being told to do so, it’s also quite a bit nosier than I anticipated, but we’ve gotten used to it at this point), I still think it deserves 5 stars. I have wood floors and a husky mix who sheds quite a bit. The dust and hair build up can get outta hand quick. We swifter daily but went a stint without running the Roomba and it was all too clear the significant difference it makes. We were constantly tracking dust and hair on our socks or house shoes, with Roomba, that doesn’t happen. The device deftly maneuvers around corners and against the edges of furniture. It will run over cords every now and again, but for the most part, doesn’t get tangled up in them. I’ve only ever had a couple of clogs, which were quickly and conveniently resolved. I haven’t used the schedule features because I prefer to be around when it’s running, just to be aware in case it runs into something. But if you’re the type who generally has an open space and remember to put things up, you could certainly take advantage of that feature. All in all, there are still at least a few improvements to be made, but for what it is, I’m happy with it!","updated":"2021-04-03T08:42:34-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1012014442&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"7851186922","userName":"Tongatim","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id104509252","version":"6.0","score":5,"title":"Remarkable machine, great customer service","text":"This is a technological marvel that actually makes life easier. We have 2 dogs and a 2500 sq. ft. house. Without Roomba, I would need to vacuum every other day. When the i7 is working, it does a great job of vacuuming between the monthly housekeeping services. It heads out each morning on the schedule I have set, recharges and empties the bin as needed until the job is done. If during the week I notice an area that is particularly dirty, I pull out my phone and tell it to clean that area…. much easier than pulling out the vacuum cleaner. It is amazingly good at mapping the rooms, maneuvering, and getting itself unstuck from tight spaces, cords, and obstacles. \n\nIn the 3 years I’ve had this model, it has quit functioning properly twice. However, iRobot customer service is easy to access by phone, and the service reps are outstanding. They guide you through diagnostics and fixes. When once this didn’t solve the problem, they sent me a shipping carton to send the robot in for service, eventually replacing the robot. \n\nSo, I’m giving the robot 5 stars for its incredible usefulness when it’s working, deduct 2 stars for the times when it has quit functioning properly, and add back 2 stars for the outstanding customer service.","updated":"2021-09-27T08:50:01-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1012014442&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"7795404008","userName":"Doityourselfer543","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id49463427","version":"6.0","score":4,"title":"Better than years ago but tweaks needed.","text":"This i6 is worlds away from the one I had 10 years ago.

That said, I was surprise/irritated that even with the advanced mapping, that it still requires light to complete a cleaning cycle, or it errors out. Obviously, the most convenient time to clean my common areas is overnight and leaving my house lit up for this is undesirable. Also, given the detail of the smart map, being able to see the actual location of the robot on that smart map in real time seems a worthy integration. If I am running a cleaning cycle from away from my home or even in the other room, it’d be nice to see where it is in the cycle. Having the green “done” area populate on the smart map as the unit covers that ground would be a great feature that relays quality info. Also, being able to manually steer the robot with an integrated in-app directional pad, even if only on local wifi control, is something even lower brands already offer. Directing it to a new room to learn, or driving it to my seat on the couch for some maintenance, etc... this in-app feature is a must. Forward, left, right, backwards... easy peasy.

I went with the i7+ for a few reasons. I wanted the the emptying base. And I also wanted the smart mapping. It has mapped my entire apartment minus the bathroom which we are still working on it to recognize the bathroom. We’ve already set areas for it to clean. I picks up all of my cats fur off the floor. And it has cleaned all around the litter box! It’s not meant to replace your normal vacuum but to lessen the amount of times you do vacuum. I don’t have a set schedule for it due to having pets so in the event my cat misses the litter box I don’t have the roomba going and dragging it around the house. Over the winter it picked up any road salt that our shoes brought into the house! All in all, it was worth the money! I do wish we could have a little fun with it.

Setting exclusion zones works, but is not very accurate. She sometimes gets lost, crashes and burns when trying to dock, or closes a door behind her and gets locked in a room. And she is noisy. But overall, she makes life around here easier, so she is a welcome addition. With regard specifically to the app, it works well and communicates consistently.

The negative is that it cannot seem to crawl onto area rugs or mats to clean them-instead it just pushes them and many times just gets stuck.  I used to have a Neato Botvac.

I’m just saying it would be nice to know as to why the job was cancelled (eg: battery needs charged; user manually cancelled; bin is full; etc). \n\nEverything else is great though…being able to start the device, adjust the schedule, &/or turn the day’s schedule on/off while not being home is awesome. \n\nLast little suggestion is that it would be nice if one could schedule multiple times to clean within one day.

The black squares on my dining room rug make it think it’s on a cliff, short of getting a new rug I’m not sure how to fix that.

Ideally it should be able to give you a rough estimate or range of time on how long the job takes based on previous cleanings. I think this is a fairly simple but really cool feature that can be added.\n2- The Keep Out Zone or Clean Zones can be identified much easier and accurately if instead of user haphazardly drawing on the map hoping to get the right region, that Roomba actually draws it on the map itself. Here is how: Place a feature that once it is turned on (under the map, add zones) the user can manually, slowly move the Roomba near or along the Keep Out/Clean zone and Roomba transmits the coordinates to the smart map. This can be fine tuned by repeating it or let it do a trial run just alone that area to confirm. Takes 5 min with the used and so much more accurate. \n\nHope the App developers are able to at least incorporate the first one. Currently users have to turn Roomba and just see how long has elapsed! Kind of annoying and rather useless as you wonder, “why is it taking this long and how much longer”. Users also don’t have any idea how long a job takes, what room is next or what is already done. \n\nThanks!","updated":"2021-01-15T09:07:06-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1012014442&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"7394186737","userName":"Michael Fried","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id24023689","version":"5.5","score":5,"title":"Roomba Rock","text":"We love having a Roomba.

It is louder than I expected but not disturbingly so. Definitely more quiet than a traditional vacuum. When it empties the bin I would say it is as loud as a traditional one. I love that it fits under my couch and chair and can vacuum there. Sometimes it finds my cats toys for me! I would definitely recommend this to someone but take into account that the recommended maintenance is necessary.","updated":"2021-07-06T19:15:12-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1012014442&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"2059340392","userName":"caxiopeia","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id636694150","version":"2.5.0","score":5,"title":"Best investment ever","text":"I bought my IRobot 980 Dec 2015.

Because it runs every day, dust does not even collect in high amounts in areas where Oscar can not get to as under the couch. I have to mention that he tends to get stuck after several weeks. Usually it helps to reset the robot. It would be nice if patches would be sent to fix some of the programming issues. \nTo give a comparison: a vacuum robot is like a dishwasher.

Update: despite iRobot’s responses to my review and many others, telling us we will all get used to it, they actually did fix a few things and make some improvements. The UI is only marginally better now, but the bug fixes are solid and the avoid zones are a great feature addition.","updated":"2021-10-16T09:59:43-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1012014442&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"7234827957","userName":"Texas Condo Man","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id521601632","version":"5.4","score":5,"title":"Good vacuum!","text":"This vacuum does a great job getting under furniture and covering my small condo on a single charge.

I personally like to have a battery powered portable to get the corners really well after the Roomba is finished.","updated":"2021-03-29T14:55:07-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1012014442&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"6685564957","userName":"dkpoomp","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1192557279","version":"5.2","score":2,"title":"App not working","text":"I bought this robot 2 weeks ago.
