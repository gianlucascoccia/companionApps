I also had issues setting up the monitor on my phone and had to use my roommate‚Äôs iPad. Got the system because we want to be alerted if CO alarm goes off while we‚Äôre not home (our furnace is very old, but can‚Äôt afford to replace it yet), but the app is focused on the camera set up which we don‚Äôt have. Based on product descriptions online I thought this system was more geared towards alarm monitoring, not camera.","updated":"2019-11-07T05:27:34-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=942334464&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"8135092176","userName":"joeyc@186","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id187353839","version":"4.0.1","score":2,"title":"Camera","text":"Kidde app need updates to fix issue with Kidde camera","updated":"2021-12-15T22:42:38-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=942334464&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"2275729026","userName":"Dover , Ben","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id544834972","version":"2.0.10","score":3,"title":"Great but...","text":"Only bad thing is, it records 6 seconds... üòí","updated":"2018-03-05T19:59:19-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=942334464&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1317142656","userName":"Malo Hombre","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id110342512","version":"2.0.8","score":5,"title":"Works great, excellent customer service","text":"Unit was working fine, then after a couple of months I couldn't get it to sync to my phone.
