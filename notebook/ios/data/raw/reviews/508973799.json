The app allows for the user to view a lot of data that is very helpful.There are a few drawbacks:\n\n1. Under “Event History” it does not show the right temperature for each “Too hot” or “Too cold” event. Instead of showing the temperature at the time of the event, it just shows 92 degrees F. My alerts go off when it gets to 80 degrees F, so it is not accurate.\n\n2. The “sub-apps” that are used to further control the main app sometimes shut themselves off. This is not ideal as the app can be used to monitor critical processes. \n\n3. The intervals at which a tag sends data to the receiver can not be changed from the app (I have not been able to).
