Now to the product... how can the product disconnect sooooooooooooooooooo many times?! It’s ridiculous... for anyone who bought this product is or looking to buy it... DONT DO IT!!!! It’s not worth it even if they were giving this away for free!!! Move along... there is nothing to see here!!!","updated":"2020-04-16T18:55:03-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=915305440&type=Purple%20Software"}]
