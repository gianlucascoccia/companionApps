They both work great with her. I even purchased a colored bulb to see how it would do. It’s working great too. In the evening it nice to add a little color to the room and it makes the room more relaxing. \nWhy I highly recommend these items from Kasa: I enjoy the being able to just say a command and my lights to turn on. Also I can also them them to turn down to a percentage and they do it. Example is if I have light on at 100% and I just want to relax , I can command to have it at 35-25% or however dim I want. That’s a great feature bc sometimes you just don’t want a bright light on. Being able to change percentage is a nice feature! \nI would also like to say. I put a plug outside on my porch. Now my porch has GFI plugs with covers, so I put one of kasa plugs in it to see when I add string lights/ Christmas lights etc... if it would work. Guess what! It worked! It was nice to be able to have my outside string  lights or whatever I had plugged in come on with my command. \nAlso I had surgery and it was nice to be able to turn on and off lights without having to climb out of bed or get off the chair or have someone do for me. \nI definitely recommend these products to use with Alexis.

For years now The policy has been to limit the total number of smart actions you can have for your devices to just three. That means you can only turn off three devices automatically so many minutes after they are turned on. What if you have four lights and four switches? Three of those can turn off automatically a predetermined time period after they are turned on but the fourth must be turned off manually.\n\nThink about exterior lighting that might come on due to a motion sensor. Or that same lighting that you might want to turn off automatically because you forget when you come into the house. You have four switches. Sorry you are only allowed three smart actions. I have nearly 100 devices. You’d think that after I have invested so much money that you could allow a few more of my devices to send requests across the network to automatically turn off. Mind you, when purchasing the devices and it talks about these smart actions, nothing has mentioned about this limitation. \n\nApart from that, the user interface screen could use an update. With nearly 100 devices, it takes a while to find the one you want. I could deal with having two or three buttons wide on my screen instead of one row per item. And it would be nice if when I am trying to toggle the circular on off button on the right side if it would not think I am trying to tap outside the button and take me into the device details instead.","updated":"2021-12-15T15:58:00-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1034035493&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"3228745597","userName":"Chaderbing","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id141337025","version":"2.5.0","score":3,"title":"A [nearly] perfect app","text":"The app is fast and bug-free.

It’s crazy, but you have to choose a position on a slider and then hit save to see if you got the percentage you were looking to select. 2. The ability to offset the sunrise function (circadian). I want to utilize my smart bulb to imitate a sunrise earlier than the sun actually rises, in order to wake up more peacefully. Right now if I select the circadian function, it will begin getting brighter at 6:45am, but my alarm is set for 6am. What’s the point of imitating a sunrise if I can simply open my blinds? Maybe if my bedroom was in the basement it would be nice... 3. Include a gradual dimming transition option. I don’t want my bulb quickly changing from 20% to 80% in the blink of an eye; rather a slow transition from the previous set time. The workaround would be to create multiple set points on a schedule on my own to have it increase a few percentages every couple of minutes, but that takes me back to issue #1. You can’t simply choose 75%. You have to find it on an unmarked sliding bar. Fix these things and my review will be a boasting 5 stars and I will definitely buy more.

It worked perfectly for the first three rooms so I bought several more only to find out that the app only supports three smart actions at once. 2) My second request is to add the sunrise/sunset feature to the non-dimmer wall switch (HS100 I think?).

The later is stupid as a default. Groups are all on or all off. Product type is useless as soon as you have more than a handful of devices of different types. Tp-Link needs to look at how real people organize their smart homes. We have areas meaningful to us - maybe rooms, maybe some function we do, with multiple devices of different product types in that area. Being able to group devices by these areas means quick access to relevant smart devices without sifting thru all the other irrelevant devices. Then we turn on or off or otherwise adjust the devices from that area that we need. I’m talking about how the bulk of Home Screen works - the device list. Update this!\n\nOther stupid stuff - only 3!smart actions can be enabled. Why bother? Sounds like a toy, not a serious tool. Controlling other smart devices with one? Uh, not Kasa.

And just as easy is creating a varying schedule for a \"lived-in look\" to our house making it look like we are home, but are actually away on vacation.\n\nWhen we began planning our kitchen remodel, I went out and bought three Kasa smart switches before even the first hammer was swung. Just like the app, these smart light switches can easily be controlled by the app, or set to a schedule. When set to a schedule, you can, of course, easily override it via the app, or the old fashioned way, by pressing the rocker switch. \n\nOur house is an older home, so unless we remodel further, as we did in the kitchen, we don’t have neutral wires which are required to install the switch.

Unfortunately is is not very friendly for schedules that change.\n\nOne direct example is I like to have both of our bedrooms lights turn on incrementally in the morning (turn on to thirty percent fifteen minutes before alarm, 60 percent at tminus ten minutes and then 100 percent at t minus five minutes). Due to the lack of grouping this requires 6 schedule programs on, 8 if you include the off settings. To further complicate there is no streamlined way to enter exact percentages so each light is always slightly off in intensity from the other.\n\nThe app also does not support an easy on and off, requiring two to three clicks to turn each of the above 8 scheduling off. This means any change in schedule results in 32-36 clicks to turn everything off and another 32-36 to turn them back on. \n\nThis makes it pretty painful if your schedule changes week to week for morning workouts and not fun to adjust for weekends.\n\nFrom a basic functional point of view this app is great and as long as you only want to control 1 light in a given room you’ll likely be fine.

Second, the reason I stated a “selection of Kasa devices” above is because I have them installed at two locations.  Kasa should allow you to create home profiles to support more than one location.  If Kasa did this they would crush their competition.","updated":"2019-07-31T14:34:31-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1034035493&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"6646121986","userName":"ls82749166518","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id17720741","version":"2.27.0","score":3,"title":"Preset and schedule functionality not up to par","text":"First I purchased two Kasa dimmable smart bulbs, and then I purchased three tunable ones so I could change the white balance. The bulbs are great, but the software needs some work - and is frustrating to use in the meantime. \n\n1. One should be able to copy presets from one device to others - it’s ridiculous to have to set these up from scratch with each device.\n\n2. I like how I can see the Kelvin temp when I’m setting white balance, as well as the brightness %s. However, when I then go to set up presets, I’m forced to set white balance and brightness blindly - there are only sliders, with no Kelvin and % numbers. This is doubly painful because once I finally get a preset dialed in, I can’t copy it to other bulbs. I’m going to return the tunable bulbs as a result - they are not worth my time.\n\n3. It’s great to be able to schedule device events. I would like to see a randomness option, where the device would turn on/off within 20 minutes on either side of a specified time, with the actual time being random. This is important when having devices turn off/on when I’m out of town.","updated":"2020-11-14T17:10:20-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1034035493&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"6656263382","userName":"ILuvUMost","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id204969063","version":"2.27.0","score":5,"title":"Love KASA!","text":"I purchased several KASA plugs and they all worked wonderfully!!

After 30 minutes of trying, I still have not succeeded in using a smart plug with Google Assistant. \n\nYet, there are more specific failures:  I’m in Japan but English is my first language.  As soon as I allowed the app to access my location, it threw up a full page of legalese —in Japanese— that could not be bypassed.  Fortunately, I’m bilingual enough to deal with that, but what if I wasn’t!?  \n\nThe app should honor its own language preference setting or at least those of the device it’s installed on. \n\nFurthermore, that long legal page was very disingenuous. It seemed to offer options to Agree (“ 同意する”) or not, but if you choose Not (“ 同意しない”) a dialog popped up basically saying “you must agree”. There was no way out from within the app.   The only way out was to close the app the same way you’d deal with a frozen/crashed program. \n\nSimilar issues are rife throughout the Kasa app.","updated":"2020-11-21T17:30:34-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1034035493&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"5337362944","userName":"worx","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id28310536","version":"2.18","score":5,"title":"Keeps getting better","text":"I was a frustrated WeMo user for many years.

You can set up an unlimited amount of scenes (e.g. turn on light x). You can set up an unlimited amount of smart actions (e.g. run scene x at time y).

Then after about a month some of the lights hanging over our dinner table stopped working. Two of the lights remained connected but the other 4 would not respond to the app! Even after uninstalling them and reconfiguring them again, the lights would only turn off upon the first seconds of pressing the power button and would then turn back on full brightness for no reason!

No matter how many times I delete the activity zone and press sounds good, it does it again the next time I open the app. I don’t want activity zones, I want clips of the whole screen, whenever there is motion. Period. Stupid feature, and makes opening the app take 30 seconds when it should take 5. Please give the option to not have activity zones.","updated":"2020-05-06T11:11:06-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1034035493&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"7872088880","userName":"Nokturnal1","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id308226109","version":"2.34.0","score":5,"title":"Nice Integration for a Reasonable Price","text":"The Kasa devices alone are very affordable and easy to set up.

Run away from Kasa.\n\nUPDATE: I HATE THIS APP.  IF I COULD GO BACK AND UN-BUY THEIR GARBAGE DEVICES THAT NEVER WORK, I’D GLADLY BE FREE OF THIS GLITCHY, AD-FILLED $&@$!\n\nUPDATE: I am so sick of the touch radius.  You try to click on or off some device and it clicks into the next screen rather than just taking the command.  Almost every time.  Ridiculously horrible design... and devices.\n\nORIGINAL:\nThe devices are glitchy.  And the ridiculous app gives ads as irrepressible notifications (“Discover Kasa” - unforgivable even if the items worked).\n\nAlmost 1/3 of the time the app takes a while to load or the devices don’t even show up.  Why do we pay money for this crap?  They certainly won’t get any more of mine.  I only wish I could return the devices I already have and get off the stupid app.\n\nStay away from Kasa.","updated":"2021-07-04T02:40:59-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1034035493&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"6714386491","userName":"Cobra Kai 82","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id42510748","version":"2.27.0","score":4,"title":"Very good, one feature missing","text":"Overall I’ve been very pleased with this app and their devices. \nOne minor thing: if you own a smart bulb, you cannot control brightness and power on/off from the main interface.
