It is unfair to the consumer to be led to think that the extra coins spent on a particular item would give them an advantage only to find out it would have been better to save those coins and get the regular stuff as this smartphone communication is nothing more than a marketing gimmick geared only to fleece the unsuspecting customer into thinking they have upgraded.

It has some bugs, including that the scan-to-cook feature often reports the microwave is in use when it is not. The microwave status shows “idle” and pressing scan-to-cook just pops up a message saying the appliance is running. I have to then actually use the appliance to heat something, and at the end of that cycle, scan-to-cook will work. But it really doesn’t matter because the scan-to-cook feature is nearly worthless anyway. I’ve scanned the entire contents of my freezer and found only 2 items that were recognized. Major national brands like Green Giant, Banquet, Marie Calendar, and TGI Friday’s were not recognized. The same was true for major retailer’s house brands, like WalMart, Meier, and Kroger - none were recognized. But if all you have to heat are Boston Market or Lean Cuisine frozen entrees, those worked, so you’re all set. The next time I’m at the store, I’m going to scan the pizza bites that Whirlpool shows in the demo video for scan-to-cook to see if they actually work, and my bet is that they will not be recognized. The app lets you enter cooking instructions manually and save them as a favorite, but this is obviously meant for ovens rather than microwaves as only whole minute increments are allowed. How about allowing the app to save a barcode, name it, and manually enter the cooking instructions including seconds if the library of supported brands is going to be so small? Better still, an interactive feature allowing users to upload their scanned items and cooking instructions to grow your library would be great.","updated":"2020-10-17T04:48:03-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1011622189&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"6823461634","userName":"BC7856","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1236355592","version":"5.0.1","score":1,"title":"Horrible App","text":"Before I could interface with microwave and oven.

We have implemented useful home automation features we have really enjoyed regrettably the Whirlpool appliance suite has been more of a pain than it has been worth.

It took several months of trial and error just to connect the appliances to Wi-Fi. Lessons learned: you may need to use the WPS feature on your router to connect. Therefore the WPS feature on your router must be enabled through your router settings online. Secondly and even more technical, you may need to connect to your appliance IP through the Internet with a laptop or pc from your home network before you can connect via any mobile devices. Lastly it only works on 2.4 Wi-Fi. Your mobile device must be on the same channel. In summary Wi-Fi connection to your appliances using this app is far to technical and complicated for the average appliance owner. \n\nOnly Minimal Wi-Fi features are functional. The application will not allow setting any of the appliance specific “preferences” without returning the error code “Error updating appliance preferences. Please try again later”.... Later has come and gone over the past year. I have submitted several work orders with whirlpool that have only wasted my time without any resolution. Previous open tickets with Whirlpool tech support have been closed without resolving the issue. They did not attempt to contact me in regard to any of the open tickets they closed. \n\nChecking for software updates via this app will crash the application and you will need to force close the application. The software update seems to be unresponsive from the preferences menu. It just says loading for a few seconds and disappears without any update notices. When you go back one menu then the software update notice finally appears stating software is up to date. The “dismiss notice” radio button does nothing and the application becomes unresponsive (crashes). You must then force close the application and log back in. \n\nThe Whirlpool tech support frequently fails to correctly identify these issues. So there can simply be no resolve if the issue is not accurately identified. I get an overwhelming perception that Whirlpool tech support Representatives simply don’t care. This has been the case for several help tickets. Today I spoke with a Whirlpool representative again who failed to listen and continuously spoke over me with erroneous feedback and unskilled understanding of the problem. He eventually initiated an argument with me until I demanded to speak with a lead. The lead however was receptive and effectively documented the problem. \n\nThese Wi-Fi appliances along with this application were chosen to improve the quality of life for a disabled Veteran with traumatic head injuries. He needs the advantages of Wi-Fi augmented devices to cook and clean however this defective application and the inability of Whirlpool to effectively and efficiently resolve systemic technical problems has become a real nightmare for this Veteran who has invested his savings of $6,000 on worthless mobile application enabled appliances. \n\nI would strongly advise looking elsewhere for applications and supported Wi-Fi enabled devices. Whirlpool Corp is clearly lagging far behind in this age of technology in that regard.","updated":"2019-11-11T13:33:35-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1011622189&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"4961892311","userName":"GW1!","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id37442949","version":"4.4.5","score":1,"title":"Not a Good App","text":"All it is good for is turning on the light and setting the kitchen timer.

Many new routers support both bands, and there’s no way to tell an iPhone “...connect only to 2.4GHz WiFi...” I get it that the appliance is limited to using only 2.4GHz WiFi, but it shouldn’t matter what frequency band the iPhone is using, as long as they are both on the same network.\n\nDevelopers should look at the setup process for a TP-Link Kasa smart WiFi plug. I set one up yesterday with the smart plug on the 2.4GHz band and my phone on the 5GHz band, and the setup process was quick and painless.\n\nAll the above being said, I’m revising my rating of this app from 1 star to 2.\n\nWe are now at the 6 month point since I first tried to connect our microwave, and several sessions with Whirlpool’s IoT support team have failed to resolve the issue.\n\nOur Orbi system provides WiFi over 2 frequencies, 2.4GHz and 5GHz, acting as one network with one SSID. The setup calls for both the mobile device and microwave to be on the same 2.4GHz network. \n\nI don’t know if this is true with Android phones or not, but it isn’t possible in iOS to select a specific frequency band...my iPhone will always connect to the 5GHz band.\n\nSo that’s a problem right away!\n\nHelp from NETGEAR showed me how to temporarily turn off the 5GHz band, and I tried this during one of the support sessions with Whirlpool, but I’m still not able to connect the phone to the microwave ‘s network.\n\nSo I’m stuck with an appliance that connects to my WiFi just fine, but won’t connect to my phone....rendering the WiFi connection completely useless.\n\nBuyer beware.","updated":"2018-12-12T12:55:23-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1011622189&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"3485909964","userName":"__arn__","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id656754542","version":"4.2","score":1,"title":"Had to replace oven","text":"I would have given less than one star if it were possible.
