From the moment I read about it on the blogs I knew I had to have it. I waited and waited and checked the order page and managed to get the bulb the first day it went on sale. I've had it since and it's been great. It's a great alternative to the Phillips hue lights... The Bluetooth is usually reliable and the few times I've had trouble a simple unplug has been enough to resolve my issue. I love the app with this product as well. It does a great job at capturing cool scenes. I do however feel it could offer more control over the bulb than just colors. A self timer would be fantastic, say turn off in 30minutes sort of thing. I would also love the ability to create my own scenes, sequence color changes, or do strobe style effects. I've even seen some other bulbs do things like flash certain colors if you have any notifications. Maybe it was done through IFTT? Anyways ultimately I love the device just wish I had more control but who knows if we'll see that in the coming time, when it happens it will elevate this product tremendously.","updated":"2014-11-27T22:55:48-07:00","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=887809971&type=Purple%20Software"},{"id":"1090152676","userName":"autonomous2323","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id13906366","version":"1.0.3","score":4,"title":"Good app and product to go with it, but I do have some suggestions.","text":"This app and the lightbulb that goes with it are great.

Not a big deal, but is annoying.\n2. I would be nice to have more granular control over the solid colors. The few colors provided do not allow for the control I would like. Maybe a color wheel type selector like you find within OS X? Something to tap and drag your finger around to find just the color you want.\n3. Like I mentioned, the scenes are pretty cool.
