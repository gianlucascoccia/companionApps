The 30% is a mix of different errors. I sit in the same desk, arm in the same position in a quiet room. The unit is positioned as instructed. But I still get messages to reposition and watch the video. I wish the error could be adjusted to report more specific information. The real question is would I buy it again and the answer is yes. Compared to other similar units this is better. I expect enhancing the software will make this unit better.', 'I compared the Qardio Arm to an Omron I had been using. Systolic pressure within 1mm; Diastolic pressure within 3mm; Standard deviations 1mm lower with Qardio Arm. HR within 2 BPM; average of 60 data points. Pretty good correlation. But ... the Qardio Arm cuff needs to be considerably looser than the Omron cuff. Qardio Arm sometimes returns error message that a new measurement needs to be taken. If you can accept this as I have, then you should be happy with this compact arm cuff BP monitor.', ""This is a great way to read BP and Heart rate. I can't wait for the rest of the equipment from Qardio. My hats off to the company. Just received the Qardio Base 2, very eye opening. I need to lose weight, now! Great. I have lost weight, just started to use Qardio again, after many months of issues. Good to see both BP and Weight down, now just keep working on it."", ""Convenient way to check your blood pressure even when you're on the road so you can test how traveling affects you. Unfortunately, it keep triggers all kinds of irregular heartbeat alerts and dangerous high pressure levels. I brought it to my doctor's office and she pretty much told me that it's a toy and if I come one more time panicked that something's wrong with me she'll throw it in the garbage."", 'Works Great. My wife got this gorgeous me to replace all of the others I have around the house. I feel by far this unit is more accurate and consistent than all of my other battery powered cuffs.

Since about a few months ago, I started noticing that the thermostat couldn't connect. No big deal, it usually reconnects back whenever that happens. Then all of a sudden, Alexa could no longer connect to the thermostat. Thinking I had to relink the app, I went in as normal into my Alexa settings, but the Alexa couldn't find the device. Then went into the honeywell home app, and here's where the problem has now been. I open up the app, and everything looks like it should asking you to either login or create an account. I already have an account so I try to login. I enter in my username and pass, and it looks like what it is trying to login. Then the app doesn't crash, but actually now just reloads the screen with the 2 buttons to either create an account or login. I've tried multiple attempts to try and login, and I'm just stuck in the same loop, no more no less. So even if I couldn't connect to Alexa, not a big deal for me. But I can't even log into the app to control the thermostats or get to any settings. Ultimately this makes this thermostat just a regular thermostat. 2 Stars since it initially worked."", ""Horrible app, I can't even use it. It gets locked in screens and won't go forward or back, demanding that Location Services be turned on (even if it's already on - turns out it wants Advanced Location Services too). After I set up one thermostat, the app won't continue unless I have a PIN on my phone. It's a home phone that stays at home, doesn't need a PIN. Security is my choice, not theirs. What a waste of time."", 'We bought this T6 thermostat mainly for the wi-fi feature so we can control temp settings from our bedroom instead of coming down stairs to the actual thermostat. (We are both elderly) The wi-fi feature is wonderful, when it works. About 60% of the time the app shows ""no internet connection"" and we have to keep trying until it works. Our internet is very good and stable throughout our house. No other devices or apps have a problem with connectivity in our house. We also made sure my Android cell phone is connected to the 2G wi-fi. That\'s another issue I have with this app. Why can\'t it work with 5G? Is there an update coming to fix the wi-fi connectivity issue with this app? Very annoying.', ""Completely non-functional for three days straight. That's right, for three days I have been trying to set up my Honeywell thermostat with this app, but I can't even log in without the app crashing back to the initial login/create account screen. So all the fancy features of my thermostat might as well not even be there because I can't use them at all. EDIT: followed their instructions below. Got the same result on my brand new Pixel 4a."", ""The geofencing only works if I open the app. I can go all day with out opening the app and when I first do it shows @home. Not until I open the app does it register that I'm away. The geofencing was working before the last couple of updates. This needs to be fixed!

They have never fixed it! It seems like they never will, they advertise this as a superior product that will make monitoring your baby so much better, when in reality it causes more stress and anxiety and you have to end up going into the room to check on your baby anyway. They charge way too much for something that doesn't work."", ""If I could give 0 stars I would. Even after 2 years my original review stands. Can't believe these fundamental issues have not been fixed! Simply doesn't work. Sound shuts off when the screen is off. 9 times out of 10 the app hangs when I load it.

275;"Tabu Lumen";"Lumen Smart Bulb is the application that allow you to control the amazing Lumen LED Smart Bulb, a revolutionary RGBW LED light bulb that can be controlled by a smart phone with the latest Bluetooth 4.0 technology.  WHAT IS LUMEN BULB:  The Lumen Bulb combines the practical utility of a standard light bulb, the party fun of multi-colored lights, and the longevity and cost saving of an LED bulb. All of this, within a single package that works with existing standard bulb sockets in our homes. Everything can be controlled easily from a proprietary application in our mobile smart phone, available for Android 4.3 devices.  RGBW:  ‘RGB’ stands for Red, Blue and Green. The Lumen Bulb can create light in absolutely any color one fancies from the full color spectrum. ‘W’ represents white. The Lumen has included 7 Watt white LEDs that generates over 400 lumens of light. It creates a perfect warm-white light that is great for daily usage.  FEATURES:  - 16 million colors with a touch of your finger  - Dimmable LED lights for you to set the perfect brightness for different activities  - Simple, easy, plug and play design  . Existing market solutions for advanced lighting systems require complex wiring and clunky control boxes fixed at a certain point in the home, and are expensive. . Lumen allows you to simply screw (E27 bulb socket) it in place of your existing bulb, and it is ready to go. . Bluetooth module built-in means that no routers or complicated configuring required, nor require any additional accessories, in order for it to work with your iPhones.  - Single/ multiple controls by Bluetooth  . Our application let you control the Lumen Bulbs individually or in a group of them. .

You control all the Lumen bulbs in your home right from the palm of your hand.  - Pre-programmed modes  We have build in 4 different standard modes to make the Lumen more fun!  . Party mode can transforms your living room into a dance floor with flashing lights that change color to suit the music playing. . Sleep mode simulates calming moonlight to improve sleep and enhance rest. . Wake up mode starts the Lumen bulb at a very dim light and gradually getting brighter till it reaches maximum intensity at the stipulated wake up time. . Ambient mode creates the perfect conditions for a romantic date or a quiet evening at home.  - Energy saving & Comparable to incandescent bulbs  . 400 lumens is the equivalent of a traditional 40W light bulb, at an unbelievable one-tenth of the power consumption, Lumen is able to create the same amount of light, translating to obvious electricity savings.

""The PowerView Shade Network is a unique radio frequency"" does not support more than a handful of devices. Hunter Douglas does not provide any support. BEWARE! In Response to HunterDouglas: Q: ""Which devices were you hoping to integrate with PowerView"" - I did not say anything about integration - PowerView floods the entirety of 2.4Ghz spectrum with its proprietary packets, killing WiFi and ZigBee in the process. - Its the only system I have seen that does not offer channel selection. It produces interference across all 2.4Ghz channels. - Reliability is poor. I\'d say 80% success rate. - Adding repeaters makes it worse. Repeaters simply re-broadcast the signal at full power, adding to the interference. - System frequently refuses to communicate with a particular shade. Only solution is to re-add the shade, creating a duplicate entry. - Right now hub shows 200 shades, but I only have ~45', ""When using the app the blinds do their own thing and very very slowly. Some go down and some don't and then they go up on their own? I have been told that the app is not working properly in the UK. The hardware is fine, and the pebble works perfectly but the same can't be said for the Powerview software. When will we get a fix?"", ""It's been a learning experience, however I am getting the hang of it.

But then I can only choose scenes. After a reboot of the device (power off) I can connect it directly again for some time.
