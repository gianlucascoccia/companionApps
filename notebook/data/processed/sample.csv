If you are wanting Ring for safety and security, a couple of show stoppers for you. 1. If you open a camera to go live, it can take 10, 15 or 30 seconds before you see it, and many times it fails altogether. 2. If you want to keep a live feed for any length of time, know that Ring allows only a few minutes of viewing time and shuts the camera off. Keep shopping;;;3.38.1;19;com.ringapp;98;en;POSITIVE
