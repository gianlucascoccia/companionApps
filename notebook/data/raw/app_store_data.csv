TV (Samsung) Remote Control;"With the app ""TV (Samsung) Remote Control"" you can use your smartphone to control your Samsung TV over the local network and/or with IR (if your android has infrared port).   You have 2 options:  ★ Network IP control (WiFi / WiFi Direct / LAN). Works with C, D, E, F, K and M (2016+) models, but not with H and F models.  - Make sure the TV that you want to use is turned [On]  - Make sure your mobile device and TV are connected to the same home network. If your router supports a privacy separator function, make sure it is disabled.  - It is also possible to enter the TV's IP address manually. To find you TV's IP address go to TV: [Menu] → [Settings] → [Network] → [Network Status].  If TV was found but after selecting the TV:  - If you have refused the confirmation message on your TV (""accept device"") you need to change your selection by going to:  [Menu] → [General Settings] → [External Device Manager] → [Device Connection Manager] → [Device List] or with older TV models [Menu] → [Network] → [Expert Settings] → [Mobile Device Manager]  or [Menu] → [Network] → [AllShare Settings].  - You can disable the TV's (""accept device"") screen by going to eg. [Menu] → [Settings General] → [External Device Manager] → [Device Connection Manager]  and changing [Access Notification] -> ""First Time Only"".  - If a PIN code is requested on your TV screen - sorry, but with this TV this app won't work :(  ★ Infrared (IR) control - This option works on phones and tablets with built-in IR blaster such as Samsung Galaxy S, HTC ONE, LG G3/G4/G5,  Xiaomi Mi / Redmi / Note, Huawei Mate / Honor etc). - Tested with Samsung TV F and M models, but probably works also with others Samsung Smart TV-s build 2005 and later (if it does, then let us now and give feedback). - Please note that you must point your phone’s IR blaster directly at the TV. Usual working range is 4-10ft (1-3 meters, max ~5 meters). - With some phones in power saving mode or with almost empty battery the IR blaster might not work or range is less then 5ft (2 meters).  The purpose is not to replace the original TV remote, but this app is handy in emergency situations (original remote is lost, empty batteries etc). It's ready to use (no need for pairing with the TV).  If this app doesn't work with your phone or TV then feel free to e-mail me (your exact TV and phone model).

Good hardware, cool idea, awful software."", ""I'll be honest... This app hasn't had a decent update for months. On my super fast home fibre, it takes far too long to load the live feed, or step back in the 15 second increments and it's even more painful the majority of the time to wait for the historical video to begin playing, when it does, it's rarely at the actual time you scroll back to. The hardware is absolutely amazing but this app... My god this app is in dire need of a complete refresh. It's difficult to recommend this right now."", ""Not happy with the frame rate or the times the camera turns on when motion is seen. For example, someone pulled in my driveway early in the morning and walked up to my door. The recording ended up stopping half way through the movement. When recording the frame rate was so bad that you could not see the person's face. FYI I have it set on max for quality and bandwidth. Also the zone feature does not work. The system can not tell the the difference between shadows of headlights and movement"", ""Unfortunately I scroll through and find significant events that Nest does not recognize as actively worthy to acknowledge. Otherwise it's pretty good. When scrolling, it's not always easy to get it to stop when i take my finger off. Picks up barking dogs and birds as someone talking at times.

There is so much that is either just irritating, poorly designed, or simply defective that I don\'t really know where to begin. Rather than repeat everything that other well-written reviews have said (most of which I have experienced too and I agree with), I\'ll hone in on one really big thing: Incoming calls from my kids rarely work. My kids being able to call their parents is the one top-of-the-list thing that absolutely *must* work all of the time. And it doesn\'t. The only time that it does work is if I have the app open, or if I have just opened it recently. Yes, I have disabled battery optimisation on the app. Yes, I have allowed all permissions. Yes, I have allowed the app to ""appear on top"". I\'ve even tried a 3rd party app that makes sure setracker2 is always running. And yet, I could call myself from my kids watch with my phone in my hand and the call will not come through. This is on my phone and my wife\'s - two different phones, two different Android versions. Most other messaging/tracking apps, including some poor ones, seem to have reliably implemented incoming calls, GPS tracking, notifications, messaging, etc without any trouble. Some of them might be poor at one feature but do other things well. Setracker and Setracker2 have managed to fail on reliably implementing *all* of the many features they claim to have. None of them work well. At all. This app is shockingly bad. If the devs are reading this: you need to consider that this app is costing your business a lot of money and invest in a re-write using reputable engineers. I am about to throw this watch in the bin (literally, because I wouldn\'t put someone else through this by giving it to them) and go and spend more money on a better alternative, and I am unlikely to ever come back to your brand. Ever. Imagine how many customers like me have crossed that line, to be lost forever?', ""Useless app. Location tells me my kid is in a field 10 minutes away though she is with me! Only really got watch / app so she could count her steps like my watch does and now the heath part of the app no longer appears (not that it worked in the first place!) My kud enjoys call family members buts the rest is pointless as it doesn't work"", ""Very few instructions on how to use the app. What should have taken 30 minutes max took me a couple hours. I was able to FINALLY figure out the location issue and how to get it out of military time. Still have yet to figure out if I can change the metric units. Still can't get the pedometer to work. Calls are clear and location is on point. Those are the only 2 things I really need the app for."", 'We were pleasantly surprised by the watch, way better than expected. The app is a little average but the functionality is actually pretty good once you figure it out. Looking forward to future improvements, all round a pretty solid offering for the price!', 'Nice so far. Updated watch firmware over wifi, and it took sim card details automatically. Watch gps is shown pretty accurate. Video and voice call pops up in seconds. Watch model KT20 4G PS for other users also...

They helped me resolve my issues quickly, by showing me how to access the information instead of just doing it for me. This is an awesome product and I do recommend it to everyone. It is extremely easy to use and brings a smile to my heart everyday."", ""Its great when it works, but sometimes the app refuses to send certain items. When this happens, it will stop sending everything else after it and just sit there using a ton of data and battery. It used 500 mb to send a 3 second clip with no audio, and 36% of my battery over the course of 2 hours. This is on my note 9 and I tried to send over wifi and data. Force closing the app doesn't work - it keeps trying to send. The only way to fix this is to restart the phone and cancel the item."", ""So Far so good...The frame was delivered to my 93 yr old Aunt that has been locked in for close to a year now du to the Corona Virus pandemic. She absolutely adores it and has shown it to every one in her building. They all love it and are amazed. An easy way to keep our isolated loved ones included in our lives when they cant be. I haven't heard her this happy, animated or excited for a year now. The app is easy to use when you get it started with the code...only have to add the code one time which is good. Then share the code with your family and they download the app, input the code then add all the pictures they want. Explaining the process to a 93 yr old who has never owned a smart phone NOT SO EASY. :) So very happy I made3 this purchase!""]";False;net.frameo.app;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.frameo.app&hl=en&gl=us

I have been told there is an updated router I could buy, but I have to buy it, so haven't. wish if there was an issue, they should send an e-mail and offer a discount, at least. 5 camera package is expensive, too expensive to have to buy upgrades in a year. app is fine, though.""]";False;com.arlo.app;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arlo.app&hl=en&gl=us

But there is a whole lot of room for improvement. It looks like it was thrown together quickly, focusing on function rather than form or ease of use. The widget can be made a LOT better looking, have more options for colors and icons (custom would be nice), and an easy way to rearrange the buttons is sorely lacking. The option to make more scenes is needed. Text placement throughout could use a bit of work, like moving whole words to a new line rather than splitting a word down the middle. The UI isn't all that intuitive, and some general prettying up would also help."", 'Pretty good. Maybe 8 out of 10 on user interface. Keeps telling me my session expired but the app says I am logged in. Not a fan of that. Pairing process was easy but I can see how it might be confusing for some. Using power strip with surge protection and light bulbs. Overall happy with it but could use some app/interface improvements. 4 to 4.5 stars. Would give it a 9 out of 10. Price is much better than others. I may eventually go Philips Hue but Gosund doing well so far. No hub required.', ""Solid enough app, does what it needs to. Not the most intuitive though - for example, figuring out where to set up 'tap to run' was just awkward. The widget is massive as well. If they can make the app more intuitive and allow users to add individual tap to run icons to the home screen (rather than force a 2x4 widget) it'll get 5 stars."", 'I recommend manually setting it up, auto set up didn\'t work for the Nite Bird bulbs. But the process was simple. Also, it may save a time to create your ""Home"" and the rooms. This way you can link the bulbs at the end of the install process, it saves a few steps later on. I love the variety of options that come with the app from the colors, to the auto mood environment settings, to the scheduling, to the fact that I don\'t need to move to control them. I\'m very happy with this purchase.', ""I love the product but... As of recently the wireless wi-fi ports and outlets will randomly turn on and off and it's happening with all four of my wireless socket parts. The worst part is I'm not notified when the devices are on or off so when I'm at work I'm unaware that my devices are turned on until I get home or when I am using those devices they will randomly cut off for no reason.

I only give it 4 instead of 5 stars due to an rather annoying feature. On the watch, you need to press a button to get the second player menu to change volume, song, and song time. This is perfectly fine and a smart way to give the player all the features it needs unlike other wear music players that leave them out. But after 3 seconds, it jumps back to the first menu; often too soon and I don't finish or have to rush. I feel like I'm fighting the UI.

Wearable Widgets;"Widgets you can wear: Wearable Widgets creates a bridge from your phone to your smartwatch for the thousands of widgets available on Android. You don't need to wait for developers to support your watch; get your apps on your wrist now, in a format that the developer has already designed for compact use. Expand your smartwatch horizons!  NOTE: If you have any difficulties, please email us - do NOT just leave a complaint as a comment here. We can probably help with whatever issue you're having, but this is an app store, not a support forum.  And a few caveats, just to adjust your expectations:  • You MUST have a supported wearable device to use this app! In addition to Wear OS, some other devices will work to some extent. See below for device-specific info, or visit http://wearablewidgets.com/devices.html  • This free app supports unlimited usage of one widget at a time. Additional widgets can be unlocked by a small in-app purchase: please confirm that your favorite widgets are compatible with your watch before buying.  • Although you'll be viewing and interacting with widgets on your watch, this app is essentially just ""screencasting"" them: the widgets themselves are actually still running on your phone. This means that any actions that result from tapping on a widget will also occur on your phone. This is fundamental and isn't a ""bug"" that can be ""fixed"".   • Similarly, you’ll find that taps and swipes on your watch take a bit longer than when you interact directly with your phone – there’s some unavoidable lag in the connection between devices. Widgets will generally still be usable, just not quite as snappy.  • Some widgets lend themselves better than others to the screen of a watch. Please use common sense.  • There are also known compatibility issues with some specific widgets, including a few that don't update when your phone is asleep. This isn't a problem we can fix either - it's down to the developers of the widgets themselves - but you can find mitigation tips for all such issues at http://wearablewidgets.com/widgets.html  Using widgets on Wear OS  Wearable Widgets needs to be installed to both your phone and linked watch separately, as it is a full-fledged app on both devices. Start by tapping the big green Install button above; then, run the app on your phone, and you should be prompted to install it to your watch.  Once installed, there are several ways to use phone widgets on your watch: ➤ As a conventional app, from the launcher (from your watch face, press the watch’s crown or main hardware button). ➤ As a watch face - great for widgets that show the time! ➤ As complications in other, non-WW faces (2x2 and smaller widgets only). ➤ As a Tile alongside your watch face.
